FNDA is managed by Charles Schwab. FNDA, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Small Co. Index.The Russell RAFI US Small Company Index measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.25%.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.52%.Story continuesSector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For FNDA, it has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector --about 21.10% of the portfolio --while Consumer Discretionary and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI) accounts for about 0.63% of total assets, followed by Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) and Visteon Corp (VC).FNDA's top 10 holdings account for about 3.19% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added about 7.76% so far this year and was up about 1.38% in the last one year (as of 08/25/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $42.52 and $53.63.The fund has a beta of 1.20 and standard deviation of 22.58% for the trailing three-year period, which makes FNDA a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 1001 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Small Company Index ETF is an excellent option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Value segment of the market. There are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider as well.IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) tracks Russell 2000 Value Index and the Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) tracks CRSP U.S. Small Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 2000 Value ETF has $10.97 billion in assets, Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF has $24.80 billion. IWN has an expense ratio of 0.24% and VBR charges 0.07%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Small Cap Value.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, there’s a wide variety of those out there that reward their shareholders handsomely.And with technology’s blistering run in 2023, many are seeking exposure to the momentum.Three stocks – Broadcom AVGO, Texas Instruments TXN, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise HPE – all pay their shareholders and have grown their payouts over the last five years.For those seeking a passive income stream paired with technology exposure, let’s take a closer look at each.BroadcomBroadcom is a premier designer, developer, and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend particularly notable for its current fiscal year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s shares currently yield a solid 2.2% annually, well above the Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector average.

The company’s revenue is also forecasted to see decent growth, with the $8.9 billion estimate 5% higher than year-ago quarterly sales.Shares saw a solid boost following its latest release, as we can see illustrated below by the green arrow.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHewlett-Packard EnterpriseHewlett Packard Enterprise is a global edge-to-cloud company with offerings spanning Cloud Services, AI, Intelligent Edge, Software, and more. The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares aren’t valuation stretched, further reflected by the Style Score of “A” for value. HPE shares presently trade at a 7.9X forward earnings multiple (F1), nicely beneath the 10.7X five-year median and highs of 14.4X in 2022.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHPE shares presently yield a solid 2.9% annually paired with a payout ratio sitting at 62% of the company’s earnings. The company’s payout has grown by 1.6% annualized over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTexas InstrumentsTexas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.

However, the figure declined 18% year over year, which was primarily attributed to the weak demand environment.Notably, Texas Instruments has returned 2.8% in the year-to-date period, underperforming the industry’s growth of 128.3%.We note that the company’s strong expansion efforts for the Analog Segment are expected to benefit its financial performance in the days ahead.For third-quarter 2023, Texas Instruments expects revenues between $4.36 billion and $4.74 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $4.57 billion.Story continuesExpanding Product PortfolioThe latest move is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward expanding its overall product portfolio.Apart from the underlined launch, Texas Instruments recently introduced UCC5880-Q1, a safety-compliant, integrated gate driver that aids engineers in designing efficient traction inverters and maximizing electric vehicle driving range.Further, the launch of SimpleLink family of Wi-Fi 6 companion integrated circuits (ICs) remains noteworthy. The ICs are designed to provide reliable, secure, and efficient Wi-Fi connections in high-density or high-temperature environments.We believe that these endeavors will continue to shape Texas Instruments’ growth trajectory and drive its momentum in various end markets.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Texas Instruments carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the broader technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Salesforce CRM, Broadcom AVGO and NetEase NTES.

The figure also matched the higher end of management’s guidance.However, revenues decreased 13% from the year-ago quarter’s level while increasing by 3% sequentially.Year-over-year decline was attributed to a weak demand environment. The company witnessed sluggishness in its Analog and Other segments.On the other hand, the Embedded Processing segment delivered improved performance on a year-over-year basis.On a sequential basis, Texas Instruments suffered from widespread weakness in the communication equipment and enterprise systems markets. The industrial end market also remained flat.It experienced sequential growth in the automotive end market, which remains a positive. TXN experienced an improvement in the personal electronics market from the prior quarter.We note that Texas Instruments’ efficient manufacturing strategies and consistent returns to shareholders are likely to instill investors’ optimism on the stock. Its substantial investments in growth avenues and competitive advantages are other positives.Story continuesSegments in DetailAnalog: Revenues of $3.28 billion were generated from the segment (72.3% of total revenues), down 18% from the year-ago quarter’s level.

(Chart: Barchart.com Inc.)We had a lot to say last week about Walmart and Target earnings reports, but it’s also worth highlighting the read-throughs for CPG companies that sell into those retailers. Many CPGs disclosed that Walmart is their largest customer, representing about 20% of total sales. Here are three takeaways important for CPGs:Consumer spending held up better than Walmart had expected at the beginning of the quarter. The retailer is seeing this in its general merchandise category, which while still under pressure is posting moderating sales declines. The implication is that, with household incomes finally outpacing inflation rates, consumers have a little bit more income for the rest of the store after buying essentials. That suggests that CPG elasticities will remain low.Walmart is focused on getting prices down to fight inflation. Walmart earns a higher margin on more discretionary general merchandise than it does on grocery items and other consumables. Many Walmart customers live paycheck to paycheck so consumable inflation comes right out of general merchandise sales. Management said that passing through lower commodity costs via promotions is “the easy way out” and it would prefer to work with CPGs on lowering on-shelf costs to reflect recent reductions in freight costs and other inputs. Expect Walmart to be more aggressive on price with suppliers.In-stock rates rise in importance. In-stock rates are of particular importance for Target as the retailer addresses a demographic that overlaps heavily with Amazon’s Prime clientele and is used to the convenience of e-commerce. Target mentioned “in stock every time” a half-dozen times on its analyst call and called it one of its three top priorities. Expect retailers to be even more demanding with their on-time and in-full expectations.Story continuesConsistent with recent performance, FreightWaves data shows a bigger drop in Target truck visits (blue) than Walmart truck visits (green). (Chart: SONAR)Food tech companies continue to struggleShares of meat alternatives company Beyond Meat (black line) and dairy alternatives company Oatly (blue line) have trended down, roughly together in the past two years. (Chart: Barchart.com Inc.)In contrast to most publicly traded consumer packaged goods companies that have reported strong results in recent quarters, there has been a surge in bankruptcies among smaller food companies, which analysts expect to continue. Recent food bankruptcies include Tattooed Chef (vegetarian foods), Do Good Foods (food made from ingredients that would otherwise be wasted) and Bang Energy (energy drink maker, which has since been acquired by Monster Beverage). In addition, there have been numerous bankruptcies in the vertical farming space, including AeroFarms and AppHarvest.What most of those companies have in common is that they have attempted to approach the industry from a unique angle, such as by using unconventional ingredients or growing methods. These segments are worth keeping an eye on because they represent potential disruption to traditional food supply chains. Venture-backed food tech companies have struggled to maintain financing as capital firms transition from demanding growth at all costs to demanding profitability — which has been hard to come by in vertical farming, in particular. The impact on pressured food categories can also be seen in certain publicly traded companies, such as Beyond Meat — which had a one-time market cap of more than $13 billion that is now less than $1 billion.Small fleets must step up service levels to mitigate scale disadvantage(Photo: FWTV)On Monday’s The Stockout show, I interviewed Guillermo Garcia, co-founder and CEO of SmartHop, a fleet management solutions company that supports very small trucking fleets. Small fleets have been under a disproportionate amount of pressure in the past year and a half due to the transactional nature of their business as spot volume dried up and as spot rates remain depressed. In that tough market, Garcia has seen an uptick in bankruptcies among small fleets.Carriers that rely on the spot market, which includes many small fleets, have been disproportionately hurt by the weak freight market the past year and a half. Contract linehaul rates and spot rates, with fuel removed, are shown in white and orange, respectively. (Chart: SONAR)To help mitigate the scale advantages that large carriers enjoy, which include a greater ability to participate in the contract market as well as better purchasing, small carriers must focus on delivering excellent service when given the opportunity. That not only includes on-time pickups and deliveries and notifying shippers of any unexpected delays but also not breaking commitments once the carrier has agreed to haul a load. Canceling on a shipper or broker to take a more lucrative load is typically not in a carrier’s best interest in the long term because maintaining relationships and a reputation for reliable service are key.See the full interview here.Redwood’s Leppert sees demand uptick as return to ‘traditional’ seasonality(Photo: FWTV)On last week’s The Stockout show, I interviewed Jeff Leppert, SVP of capacity solutions at Redwood Logistics. Redwood looks to optimize its clients’ supply chain efficiency, which often involves using modally diverse capacity solutions. Leppert considers the uptick in freight demand in July and August to reflect at least a partial return to seasonal patterns that are more traditional as inventories are now closer to being rightsized and with back-to-school and preholiday freight season upon us. Leppert expects now-defunct Yellow’s market share to be easily absorbed by the remaining less-than-truckload players and believes that maintaining carrier relationships will be key for shippers to secure capacity for when the market eventually turns back in carriers’ favor — something we hear often and is easier said than done.

We saw that while Target TGT provided soft guidance and Macy’s M complained about rising credit-card delinquencies, Walmart WMT, TJX TJX and others had good results.This somewhat mixed showing notwithstanding, trends in consumer spending remain positive and reassuring. This suggests that the weak operators either didn’t execute well or had merchandize that was out-of-sync with what consumers wanted or both. Walmart continued to execute and that showed in its results.Beyond the Retail sector, the Q2 earnings season has been a good one, with an above proportion of companies earnings estimates. This is significant since estimates hadn’t fallen by that much ahead of the start of the Q2 reporting cycle.Earnings growth in the aggregate was weak in Q2, but a big part of the weakness was due to the Energy sector drag. Excluding the Energy sector, the year-over-year earnings decline in Q2 was fairly modest.Importantly, estimates for the current period (2023 Q3) are holding up really well.

Before we begin, I'd like to welcome our new CFO, Cathy Smith to our earnings call. Cathy is a proven finance leader with many years of experience delivering business results. She has deep expertise navigating the dynamic retail environment in her prior roles with some of the largest retailers in the country. We are thrilled to have her on the team. You will hear more from her today. I'll start with our Q2 performance. We delivered solid results in the second quarter, with earnings per share higher than last year despite lower sales. As we've said since the beginning of this year, we saw clear opportunities to drive higher profitability even in a challenging sales environment. We continue to make progress on our 3 key priorities to improve performance at Nordstrom Rack, increased inventory productivity and optimize our supply chain capabilities. Our teams performed well, working to improve the customer experience while staying focused on these priorities. Our top line results improved sequentially from the first quarter at both banners. At the Nordstrom banner, our teams did a good job curating the assortment for our anniversary sale, balancing relevance that things customers expect to find with inspiration, the new items they discover shopping online and in-store. Customers responded positively to newness in our fall assortment during our successful anniversary event particularly in stores. At its core, anniversary is a one-of-a-kind event that rewards and engages our loyal customers with brand-new product from the best brands at reduced prices for a limited time. We saw higher engagement throughout the event with more customers this year attending over 740 events and over 90% of our highest level Nordy Club members shopping during the sale. In addition, we're pleased that anniversary had a very strong inventory sell-through, which was up 15% from last year and puts us in a better inventory position as we enter the second half. At Nordstrom Rack, our initiatives to improve our product mix with strategic brands helped deliver sequential improvements in both top line and profitability. Sales trends at the Rack also improved sequentially throughout the quarter, and July was our best month. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against the financial outlook we set for 2023, even as we continue to navigate economic uncertainty in the near term. We're encouraged by the progress we made this year and remain focused on delivering against our 3 key priorities in the second half to drive higher profitability and return to long-term profitable growth. I'll highlight a few wins we had during the second quarter within our 3 priorities: improving performance at Nordstrom Rack, increasing inventory productivity, and continuing to advance our supply chain optimization initiatives. At Nordstrom Rack, we are delivering on our promise of offering great brands at great prices, and our teams made significant progress on our initiatives to improve both sales and profitability. As we shift our assortment mix to include more of the brands we know our customers respond to, we are seeing results improve through a higher sell-through and faster inventory turns, giving customers newness each time they shop at Nordstrom Rack. In the second quarter, sales from strategic brands came in at our target of 65%, and we've planned our on-order for the second half similarly to meet our goal. We are pleased with the progress we made to expand our reach with 8 new Rack stores opened to date in 2023, and we look forward to opening 11 additional new stores by the end of the year. Rack stores are a great investment with returns that exceed our cost of capital in a short payback period. Rack stores also represent the largest source of new customers for Nordstrom and we are bringing the Rack's unique product offering and suite of convenient services to more markets as we expand our footprint. Turning to our second priority of improving inventory productivity, we continue to manage with leaner inventories, improved sell-through, and faster turns across most of our categories, resulting in gross margins that are on par with last year's Q2, which was the highest margin quarter of 2022. We also made progress rightsizing our designer inventory and continue our work to further reduce our position there. We are entering the second half of the year in a good inventory position at both banners with overall levels down 18% compared to last year versus an 8% decrease in sales. Stronger sell-through during the anniversary sale positions us well to be more responsive to what customers are buying in the second half of the year. Our lower inventory levels will set us up to deliver gross margin improvements, particularly in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Turning now to our third priority, supply chain optimization, we delivered a better experience to our customers through faster delivery, especially during anniversary. For the fourth consecutive quarter, variable supply chain costs fell by over 100 basis points as a rate of sales versus the prior year, helping to mitigate overall SG&amp;A deleverage on lower sales. Since we started, we're delivering faster and at lower cost. We began our current supply chain optimization work in early 2022. And since then, we have delivered significant customer benefits and operational efficiencies. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, supply chain cost per unit in the second quarter of this year were 5% lower against an inflationary backdrop of about 7% over that time. Looking ahead, we continue to seek out additional efficiencies in flow and improve productivity through inventory management initiatives. In closing, we are making solid progress against the 3 priorities we set at the beginning of the year, and we'll continue to focus on these goals. We are fortunate to have an experienced team who has embraced a more disciplined operational approach we are taking to manage near-term headwinds while continuing to keep the customer at the center of everything we do. We have a strong balance sheet and cash position and are confident that by continuing to invest in our digital and supply chain capabilities as well as in our stores, we will be better positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and long-term shareholder value. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.Story continuesPeter E. NordstromThanks, Erik. I'll cover our category performance and the anniversary sale, and then I'll discuss the progress we're making on inventory management and supply chain. Starting with merchandise performance. Most categories improved sequentially from the first quarter in terms of year-over-year trends. The active category was up slightly from last year, driven by active footwear. Customers responded well to new offerings and selections from brands HOKA, On Running, New Balance, and Nike. Beauty continued to perform relatively well at both banners and the category was up slightly versus last year. At Nordstrom Rack, our expanded offerings from great brands, including MAC, Too Faced and Clinique did well. Kids and Men's apparel each performed better than average. Women's apparel improved sequentially from the first quarter but performed lower than average. Within men's and women's apparel, we saw customers drawn to more dressed up and tailored looks with contemporary brands, including Veronica Beard, Vince and Theory. At Nordstrom Rack, sales of accessories, especially handbags, showed strength. As anticipated, designer remains under pressure. We made significant progress reducing our inventory position during the second quarter, and we'll continue to rightsize to the shift in consumer demand in this category. In order to improve inventory flow and margin health, we are focused on driving faster turns this year across both banners. During the second quarter, we made solid progress on this. Now turning to anniversary. As Erik described, the Anniversary Sale is a unique event that rewards and engages our loyal customers with brand-new products for many of their favorite brands, markdown during the sale before they are marked up to full price. Customers responded well to our curated assortment, which balanced both relevance and inspiration. This helped drive the very strong sell-through Erik highlighted earlier and puts us in a favorable inventory position as we entered the second half. We are pleased to see customers shop activewear and fall items, including dressed up looks and sweaters, boots and jackets. They also shop for baby gear from brands like Nuna. In addition, customers responded positively to our improved assortment of Nordstrom private brands, which are important to the event's success. Our teams did an outstanding job during anniversary, welcoming customers into our stores and at nordstrom.com and delivering a convenient and connected experience through events and personalized services. We were better prepared to start the sale this year given complete and timely delivery of product as a result of the continued productivity initiatives in our supply chain. Total anniversary event sales were 5% lower compared to last year, in line with overall trends given the ongoing softness in customer spending. This includes the 8 days that fell in the third quarter this year, whereas 1 day was included in last year's Q3 results. We are pleased by the strong sell-through on anniversary products, which exceeded our plans and put us in a favorable inventory position as we enter the second half of the year. We are committed to serving customers on their own terms, and we've integrated our physical and digital assets to create a seamless journey. Digital sales accounted for over 60% of the overall event and over 40% of these digital sales were enabled by our stores through either buy online, pick up in store, store fulfill or ship to store. We had our highest hour of demand on nordstrom.com of all time during our early loyalty member access window of the sale. We continue to enhance our inventory flow across most of our categories with inventory turn improving slightly in the second quarter. For the second half, we are focused on managing with discipline by improving inventory health in both banners and will continue to drive for higher productivity. We are maintaining reserves against our buy plans, which enables us to respond in season to trends and customer demand. At Nordstrom Rack, we made significant progress increasing strategic brand penetration, and we'll continue to improve our mix in the second half. Strategic brands have better productivity than other brands in terms of sell-through. They also create a point of differentiation with our customers because we know they want great brands at great prices. Turning to supply chain. Erik spoke earlier to the benefits our teams delivered from our supply chain optimization initiatives. Looking forward, we expect to deliver additional operational efficiencies by continuing our work in inventory productivity, returns processing and transportation, and ramping up RFID initiatives. To wrap up, we're making solid progress on each of our 2023 priorities. We're confident in our ability to improve our profitability this year. There's more to accomplish ahead, and we're well positioned for the second half. With that, I'd like to welcome Cathy to our call, and I'll now turn it over to her to discuss our financial results.Catherine R. SmithThanks, Pete. I'm excited to be part of the Nordstrom team. I have tremendous respect for the company, brand and legacy of customer experience and service. I am honored to help Nordstrom drive profitable growth and long-term success. I look forward to reconnecting with those of you I already know and getting to know those of you I don't. Now I will expand on what Erik and Pete have already shared about our quarter. I'll start with our second quarter results and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. For the second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.84 compared to last year's earnings per share of $0.77. When excluding charges related to the wind down of Trunk Club, last year's adjusted earnings per share was $0.81. We are pleased with the year-over-year EPS increase despite the $330 million fewer sales. Net sales as well as gross merchandise value, or GMV, decreased 8% in Q2. Net sales included a negative impact of 275 basis points from the wind down of Canadian operations. They also reflect a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points from the timing shift of the anniversary sale with approximately 1 week falling into the third quarter this year compared to 1 day last year. Excluding the impact of these 2 items, net sales would have been down about 4% versus last year. During the quarter, sales trends improved each month when excluding the impact of the anniversary timing shift and the improvement was most pronounced at Rack. Nordstrom banner sales and GMV each decreased 10% versus last year, with sales improving sequentially from the first quarter when year-over-year net sales decreased 11%. The wind down of Canadian operations included a negative impact on Nordstrom banner net sales of 400 basis points, and the anniversary timing shift had a negative impact of approximately 300 basis points. Nordstrom Rack sales decreased 4%, improving sequentially compared to a 12% year-over-year decrease in the first quarter. We estimate the decision to eliminate store fulfillment of Rack digital orders starting in the third quarter of 2022 had a negative impact to this year's Q2 sales of approximately 500 basis points. Digital sales decreased 13% in the second quarter. This includes an estimated 500 basis point negative combined impact from eliminating store fulfillment of Rack digital orders in the third quarter last year and sunsetting Trunk Club in the second quarter of 2022. It also includes an estimated 300 basis points negative impact from the anniversary timing shift. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points, primarily reflecting deleverage on lower sales, partially offset by lower buying and occupancy cost. Ending inventory decreased 18% versus last year compared to an 8% decrease in sales. Our inventory is better positioned as we move into the back half of the year, thanks to the strong sell-through during our anniversary sale. Looking ahead, we will continue to benefit from improved inventory management routines and disciplines while meeting customer demand. SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales was flat to last year's second quarter, driven by improvements in variable costs from supply chain efficiency initiatives, which helped offset higher labor expenses and deleverage from lower sales. In addition, expenses in the second quarter this year benefited from a couple of items outside of our normal run rate, namely a gain on the sale of our real estate assets and lower carrier costs than previously expected. We are pleased with the momentum in our supply chain initiatives. And as Erik mentioned, this marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we have delivered over 100 basis points of improvement in our variable cost as a percentage of sales. EBIT margin was 5.3% for the second quarter, up 20 basis points from last year's EBIT margin. After excluding charges in last year's second quarter related to the sunsetting of Trunk Club for comparison purposes, EBIT margin was flat to last year's adjusted margin of 5.3%, and again, despite lower sales this quarter. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet and financial position, ending the second quarter with $1.7 billion in available liquidity and including the full $800 million available on our revolving line of credit. Turning to our outlook for the rest of the year. I'll start by discussing the current environment and related assumptions underlying our guidance. We continue to see a cautious consumer, and it remains to be seen how changes in inflation and higher interest rates will affect discretionary consumer spending in the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season. We saw sequential top line improvement in the second quarter. However, while it is early in the third quarter, sales trends have decelerated at both banners. We expect to make continued progress on our key priorities, which will help improve our profitability and mitigate inflationary cost pressures. Considering these factors, we are taking a cautious approach to planning we maintain our outlook for the full year despite better-than-expected results in the first half. I'll highlight a few factors that shape our outlook for the rest of the year, starting with revenue. we continue to expect revenue to decline 4% to 6% versus 2022. This outlook includes an approximately 2.5 percentage point negative impact from the wind down of our Canadian operations, which delivered sales of approximately $400 million in 2022. It also includes an approximately 1.3 percentage point positive impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, which we expect will add approximately $200 million in sales in the fourth quarter. Year-over-year sales comparisons will become more favorable in the second half of the year, and we continue to expect sequential top line improvement compared to the first half. Two things benefit year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter. One, we will start to lap the impact of eliminating the store fulfillment of Rack digital orders. Second, the anniversary sale timing shift will positively impact third quarter sales by approximately 200 basis points. Offsetting the tailwinds are headwinds with respect to our credit card business. Our credit card revenues were up 10% in the first half of the year from higher revenue recognized in connection with our credit card partner agreement and with lower-than-expected credit card losses. That said, we have seen delinquencies rising gradually, and they are now above pre-pandemic levels, which could result in higher credit losses in the second half and into 2024. Turning to EBIT, we continue to expect adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 3.7% to 4.2% for the full year versus 3.3% in 2022. Our forecast assumes that adjusted EBIT margin expansion will be driven primarily by gross margin improvements in the second half from our focus on inventory productivity when compared to the elevated markdowns we took in 2022. We expect SG&amp;A expense rate will be impacted by deleverage from lower sales given our sales trend outlook with partial offset from our ongoing supply chain optimization initiatives, although to a lesser extent, as time progresses. We also maintain our outlook for adjusted EPS for the full year. Our GAAP earnings per share outlook remains $0.60 to $1 for the full year, which includes the Canadian wind-down charges and related tax impact. Excluding the impact of these charges, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 to $2.20 for the full year. Shifting to capital allocation. Our priorities remain the same. The first is, investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We continue to plan for capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5x. Our third priority is returning cash to shareholders. Last week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. We are pleased with our solid results in the second quarter and progress on our 2023 priorities of improving Nordstrom Rack, increasing inventory productivity and optimizing our supply chain capabilities. We continue to focus on driving profitable growth. We remain confident in our ability to navigate through the near-term uncertain environment and deliver shareholder value over the long term. With that, Sara, we're ready for questions.Sara PennerThank you Cathy. Before we get started with Q&amp;A, we ask the participants please limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. We'll now move to the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.Ashley Anne OwensThis is Ashley on for Noah. Just first with the guidance and stronger improvement in Rack relative to full price this quarter, how should we be thinking about the pace of both banners in the back half? And then I have a follow-up.Catherine R. SmithAshley, it's Cathy. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? I didn't quite catch the back half of your question?Ashley Anne OwensYes. So with the stronger improvement in Rack relative to full price, just how should we be thinking about the pace at both banners in the back half of the year?Catherine R. SmithYes. Thank you. Ashley. So as we -- first off, just to remind us, we had a good, solid second quarter. We're really pleased with the results that we're delivering, and we did reiterate our full year guidance for the back half. So thinking through the sequential improvement we've seen already through the first half of the year, we would expect that to continue sequential improvement through the back half. So particularly Q4, we'll -- you'll see the benefit of that 53rd week. So think about that. And then it's going to be a little bit offset by the loss of the Canadian operations. And then obviously, we have a little bit better, easier comp in the fourth quarter. And then Q3, I would think of it as kind of in between Q2 and Q4.Ashley Anne OwensOkay. Great. And then just on inventory, could you provide us with some additional color on the current mix? And then maybe where you think you are in your efforts to rightsize designer?Catherine R. SmithMaybe -- Ashley, this is Cathy. I'll start, and then I'll ask Pete to comment on designer a little bit. So we're really pleased that we've continued to drive inventory productivity. It's 1 of our top 3 priorities this year, as you guys know, and the team has done a terrific job. Inventory is down almost 18% on sales down 8%. Units are down even more than that. And so we're really pleased that we're going into the back half of the year in a healthy inventory position. It allows us to really chase after the consumer demand and make sure that we can meet them. And then on designer, maybe Pete can answer a little bit there.Peter E. NordstromYes. On designer, as you know, if you've been listening to the calls over time, we've had really good growth in the designer category, and we've invested against that. And it changed rather abruptly about a year ago. And so we found ourselves with more inventory, more on-orders than we would have liked, given the sales trends. And we have yet to work through that. It takes some time, this doesn't turn as fast as other categories. A lot of that product is continuative product. And so it's not as inherently perishable, but it is aging at the same time, and we do have more week forward covered than we need. So it takes time to work through that, and we're working through it with our vendor partners on the design side.OperatorNext is from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachI was hoping you could provide some more context on the drivers of the Rack performance during the quarter. You mentioned that trends performed better each month of the year, but you've also seen a little bit of a recent deceleration. How did traffic ticket and conversion trend throughout the quarter and into the beginning period of back-to-school relative to your expectations? And as you look ahead, can you contextualize the most important drivers of Rack performance, do you expect through the back-to-school and holiday season?Erik B. NordstromBrooke, this is Erik. Yes, we're really pleased with our -- the trend of our Rack performance. So it's in a steady upward trajectory throughout this year. And as you know, really, the foundation of our focus has been great brands at great prices. We know the reason most customers come to Nordstrom Rack is to find the great brands they love at terrific prices. And so we've been very intentional in devoting more of our inventory to these strategic brands. And as we've increased that proportion, we've seen our business get better. And I know it sounds simple, but it's -- that has been our focus and it is paying off for us. So we feel really good about our inventories there that we're in a position to be more aggressive and reactive to what we're seeing from customers. But again, the overarching strategy is to put more of those dollars into these strategic brands. So that's what we mainly look at.And again, as we've done that, we've seen our business get better. To your question on traffic conversion ticket. Traffic has both -- across both banners has been softer. What's -- what we've seen strength in is in conversion and spend per customer. So that's a good reflection of the content we have and the customer experience we're providing.Brooke Siler RoachGreat. And if I could just ask one second question. You spoke in the prepared remarks about rising headwinds in credit as a result of delinquencies. Can you provide a bit more detail on what you're seeing there and your expectation for credit contribution into the back half?Catherine R. SmithSo first, bigger picture, our loyalty program and our credit card customers are really an important part of our business. They are typically our most engaged and most loyal customers. So we always think of that cohort in that light. We do typically have a little higher quality credit consumer as well in our credit customer, which means they're going to be a little bit more resilient. What you did hear us say, and you'll see it in the filings that are -- we're seeing good strength in credit card revenues through the first half of the year. But as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've seen delinquencies slowly rising throughout the course of the year, and they are now at a kind of around pre-pandemic levels. That just -- those can be a precursor for higher credit losses in the future. And so we're going to be mindful there and continue to watch it. And we do watch the portfolio closely. But as we said, I think our consumer tends to be a little bit more resilient, and so we'll continue to watch that.OperatorAnd next is from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyWelcome Cathy. Just following up on the credit for a moment. When you go back to the great financial crisis 2008, 2009, any parallels to learn of what happened then and what you're seeing now? And then following up on the Rack business and the new stores that you're opening this year, how is new store productivity ramping versus what you may have expected or versus previous? And then just lastly, seeing what happening currently in the current environment. Any adjustments to plans for holiday from what you've typically done in the past?Catherine R. SmithDana, first off, great to see you or hear you again. So I appreciate that. Maybe I'll start with credit. And if Erik wants to talk a little bit about Rack productivity or I can, and then maybe I'll finish up with Pete on holiday and how we're doing that. So with regards to credit, you made me smile when you asked the question because I lived through the financial crisis in a homebuilder. And to my very first question, to the team was tell me about how we performed in '08, '09 and '10 as well. So it made me smile that that's where you went as well. And I would tell you, first off, for a lot of reasons, the business is a little different now than then, we have a different arrangement with our credit card partner. We have a great partner there. And so it is a little different arrangement. We continue to have a very strong credit quality in our portfolio as well.So for a lot of reasons, although our credit losses aren't projected to be anywhere near where they were in the financial crisis, it's a different book of business and a different arrangement. So we feel very good about where we are and kind of how we're projecting it. They have pretty good insights because you do see the delinquencies coming. So feel like we're in a good place there. And again, I'll go back to the big picture, and that is they're a really important part of our customer set. We -- they typically are most engaged customers, so we're really pleased with that. Maybe I'll turn it over to Erik on Rack productivity of new stores and then Pete on holiday.Erik B. NordstromDana, we're really pleased with our Rack new store performance and I'll just center you on the importance of Rack new stores, first and foremost, it's a great return on our investment. And Rack new stores, the returns we're getting out of those is very strong, well ahead of the cost of capital, and we're encouraged by that.Peter E. NordstromDana, it's Pete. With regards to holiday, in terms of changes from the past, I think the biggest thing is coming out of anniversary sales clean and having efficient inventory is super helpful. And we obviously have our plan, and it's to continue to focus on the gifting target, but we also have some dry powder so that whatever we're able to learn here in the first couple of months of fall, we could invest back into holiday in terms of replenishment and a lot of those more kind of staple items that can help us a lot during the holiday season. So I think we feel really good about the new things we're able to invest in and how we're able to activate and energize the store and the shopping experience with making sure that we've got the proper amount of money we can properly invest into the business for that time. So we feel good about it.OperatorAnd the next question is from Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler.Edward James YrumaI guess first on gross margin. I was wondering if you could unpack a little bit and kind of break out the impact of deleverage on lower sales versus lower markdowns versus last year? And how we should think about markdowns given the improved inventory level going forward? And then just as a follow-up, obviously, lots of discussion about shrink. We all saw the video what happened in Topanga. Just trying to understand how you see [shrinks] play out for the remainder of the year?Catherine R. SmithEd. So good to hear you again and look forward to seeing you live at some point. On gross margin, I'll impact that a little bit. And then maybe I'll ask Erik to comment on shrink and theft as I know it's been a topic with many retailers. But starting with gross margin to your question on deleveraging of sales, that absolutely has an impact, as you think about for the quarter, always does. Overall, though, with our -- the continued work of the team, we were down gross margin only 20 basis points on the deleveraging of the sales, partially offset by a little bit of lower building and occupancy costs, so -- or buying and occupancy cost. So generally, I would feel really good about gross margin. As we think about going forward, though, for gross margin, Q3, you're going to see -- continue to see that the supply chain productivity for EBIT, which obviously don't show up in gross margin as much. A little bit of sales deleverage.But then going into the back quarter or the fourth quarter, last year, remember, we had a lot of inventory that we bought through and marked down. We're not going to see that same level or not planning to this year, given the quality or the health of our inventory going into the back half. So I think, overall, we feel really good about being able to focus on the things we can control, no matter what the consumer environment provides. Maybe, Erik, you could talk a little bit about shrink or theft.Erik B. NordstromYes, sure. Let me start with just, the safety of employees and customers is always a top priority. Certainly, what happened in our Topanga store is disturbing to all of us. But the loss is a concern. Losses from theft are at historical highs. And I'd say we find it unacceptable and needs to be addressed. That being said, while it's unacceptable, it is within our plans. We have not seen continuing rising of shrinkage that has exceeded what we've planned. So it's in line with how we lead out this year.But the drag on earnings, just from a financial performance, that needs to come down. And we've done a lot of things, and we're looking at everything we can do to make our stores safe and secure, first of all that they can be, but also to address the loss. And there's things within our control that we can invest in, but also involves partnering with local jurisdictions, law enforcement. I think the legislation is part of the mix to here that all industry needs to come to some better solutions on.OperatorNext is from Blake Anderson with Jefferies.Blake AndersonI wanted to start with Nordstrom Rack. Can you talk about kind of what inning are we now for getting the top brands back to normal in terms of the mix? I think you're pretty close, but just wanted to ask about that? And then just more broadly on newness, how did that trend throughout the quarter? And how are you planning on newness for the back half?Peter E. NordstromYes. This is Pete. In terms of the Rack top brands and where we are in that journey. It's a little hard to say, but we've made considerable progress. And I think if you go back to our original intentions of how to think about this, we're getting pretty close. It feels like by the end of this year, we should have a really I think a good picture of where this settles out. And I don't think we're particularly far from that right now. And certainly, our [buys] indicated. We're talking about it relative to the sales our future on-order, I think, really represents where we think we should be. So we're fairly close. I don't know. Maybe we're in the bottom of the 6 that are top of the seventh I don't know, in terms of innings, if that's the analogy. And I'm sorry, the second question was about what? Just newness in the Rack stores?Blake AndersonYes, that's right. I wanted to ask I guess more about Rack in terms of (inaudible).Peter E. NordstromYes. We talk a lot about inventory turns, and there's really 2 reasons for that. One of them is inventory -- faster inventory turns, the leading indicator of margin health, means you're probably selling through pretty well. You don't have markdowns. But particularly in the Rack business and the Nordstrom banner, too, the flow really matters. And if we can really even out our flow and have that stability and predictability. It gives us a lot of agility down the line to be able to respond. And your customers, particularly in the Rack, they like to come in often and see what's new and what's going on there. So a big part of our turn agenda is around flow and that impacts the newness. So we're -- I think probably like a lot of retailers are hearing from the newness has always been a key driver for us in terms of what drives top line.Blake AndersonThat's helpful. And then I wanted to ask on the quarter-to-date traffic decline. Can you give any more detail on maybe what you think is driving that in terms of any type of income cohort? Or how much is it -- I know you talked about designer remains under pressure. Any other commentary you could provide would be helpful.Catherine R. SmithYes, Blake, maybe I'll give it a try. So traffic, as Erik mentioned, traffic trends have remained soft. We're seeing sales made up obviously with higher conversion and higher selling price than we've seen versus last year. On an income cohort basis, we do see softness across the income cohorts, but the higher income cohorts are performing better than obviously the lower. I guess that seems pretty obvious when I say it out loud. But we see that in the data as well. So the good news is we tend to have a little higher income cohort in the Nordstrom banner, and those are performing well. So I think that's generally what's been driving the traffic trend. In the buy banner, though, earlier in the quarter was a little softer, and then we did see some strength. But again, we'll continue to think about where we're going in the back half, and we'll focus on the things we can control and hopefully have a great assortment for our customers to keep coming in.Blake AndersonAnd if I could squeeze in 1 more. Maybe, Cathy, if you want to take a shot at this and welcome. On can you help us at all in terms of how to think about Q3 versus Q4 EPS? Or maybe just a little more commentary on the margins.Catherine R. SmithYes. Sure, I'm happy to. And then -- Blake, always happy to do that in a follow-up as well. But thinking about Q3 versus Q4. So top line has got a little bit of noise moving through. Obviously, still a sequential improvement, which I talked about earlier. As you think about from Q1 to Q2, we'd expect Q3 and then the Q4 continued sequential improvement. That's also coming off of last year a little bit easier comps. Q3 and then Q4 was the easier comp. So that's the first thing top line. Second thing is we have the 53rd week in the fourth quarter. So think about those as you think about the shape of the quarter.On an EBIT or EPS and subsequently, on a profitability level. We're going to have continued supply chain productivity continuing in the back half of the year. It will start to moderate a little bit. We've been seeing the 4 quarters of over 100 basis points of improvement, so you'll start to see that moderate a little bit in the quarters going forward. But I think probably most significantly is in the fourth quarter, you're going to see the lack of markdown to the extent we had last year. So that will help the profile of profitability into the fourth quarter.OperatorNext is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Oliver ChenRegarding e-commerce, what's your path forward in terms of resuming growth there? And what's assumed for the back half in terms of guidance. And as we think about women's merchandise at large at both banners, what are your thoughts on the main issues? And also how you're doing with the younger customer as well within women's apparel.Erik B. NordstromOliver, it's Erik. I'll start on the digital one and Cathy can join in and then Pete can take the one merchandising question. As you know with us, we don't really get hung up on channel splits. It's -- we look at our business by banner. We've invested a lot over the years to have a seamless experience and really be where the customer wants us to be. And you add to it that economically we get the same profitability -- roughly the same profitability of nordstrom.com sale that we do or Nordstrom store sale. So we always got to -- start with the customer experience as a real focus on the channel experience.That being said, I think this year, you're seeing out of us and I think others too, that there is a return to stores. Stores have relatively performed well. With us, there's some added noise in our digital sales of -- and the comparisons against last year. If you remember, last year, we turned store fulfilled from our rack.com that had some softness, Trunk Club sunsetting, there's some noise in those numbers there. That being said, longer term, we think Nordstrom.com is a growth vehicle for us. We think Rack stores are the big growth vehicle for -- in the Rack banner. But in the Nordstrom banner, we think that the digital channel presents a lot of opportunity for us. It is leveraging our physical assets. So we see continued making investments in particular things around selection that we can continue to bring our customers the breadth of selection that they want from us.Peter E. NordstromRelative to the women's apparel, we make good progress there, and it feels like a broken record probably. A lot of that has to do with just having our inventory levels to be in the right spot. We've had good success and we learned a lot through Anniversary Sale, which is a huge advantage for us being able to get that kind of read on what's going on and how to be able to project a little bit what's going to happen in fall. But the dressed up looks for us really across the board in men's and women's has been good. But I think about women's like selling a third piece, so it's a jacket or it's a sweater. That business has been really strong. I think particularly in the contemporary types of categories, if you look at that price level and with those types of brands, we've had a good -- really good solid business, and we feel great about that. We feel like we're on a positive trajectory with women's apparel.The other thing I'd say about women's apparel and the Rack, it's a disproportionately important category there. And that's another place where we just -- we have a lot more efficiency with our inventory. We're focusing on those strategic brands, you might make up a much higher percentage of our inventory ownership and so that inventory is working for us better. So if we can continue to smooth up the flow and respond to the newness that goes with that, be opportunistic in the Rack, in particular, we're in good shape. You mentioned the younger customer. I mean it feels like that's a bit of an evergreen opportunity. We need to do better with the younger customer and we have plans to do that. I think our own label programs are going to be a big part of that. I wish we could flip the switch and change that overnight. But as you know, these things take a little while. But I like where our plans are with that and what we're trying to accomplish and how that's going to appeal to young customer, both with style and price. But I think that's a good opportunity for us. And then in '24, we should be able to see improvements to that young customer business that will be accretive to our total women's business.Oliver ChenOkay. And a follow-up, as we zoom out a bit, you do have advanced data analytics platform as well as AI within your IT. What are you thinking about your merchant organization and how that can get faster and test, read and react and how that can intersect with the analytics capabilities you have to just drive more inventory agility overall?Peter E. NordstromThis is Peter. I mean relative to AI and analytics and all that, it has to go without saying, I guess that, that is a key element to success in retailing. I mean we've got to be able to embrace the data and I think whatever tool technology brings to the party that allows us to be faster and more agile. We learned nothing else with COVID -- that's the kind of stuff that we need to invest in. And we talk a lot here about how technology becomes an enabler for all things we do, but particularly in merchandising. So I don't have anything to announce or declare here other than we're staying close to that, and we're always looking for ways that we can improve our efficiency and effectiveness in merchandising.Catherine R. SmithMaybe the only thing I would add on is, as all companies right now, and particularly all retailers, too, our team has been working for some time on great data platform. So we have a lot of richness there and are now starting to apply AI in all the places you would expect, everything from enhancing the customer experience to the operational capabilities to the merchant organization, like you just said, probably a long way to go, but I think everyone is putting some real energy around it.OperatorAnd our last question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo Erik, at the Rack, with the strategic brand penetration target now reached, what do you see as the time line from here for Rack to return to positive top line growth? Maybe just help us to think about incremental opportunities that you see to drive continued top line improvement at the Rack banner multiyear as we think about price mix or categories?Erik B. NordstromYes. We -- as we've mentioned, we see continued sequential improvement, which you play that out, that gets us to having increases by the end of the year. And we see the Rack banner overall being a growth driver for us. One part of that is new stores, but we do see comp store growth coming. The strategic brand, it's part of the power and effectiveness for us has been in simplicity. But it is a bit of a blunt instrument. As you get within those strategic brands, they're not all created equal. And it varies with seasons. So within that mix of strategic brands, we're in a position to move quickly and invest in those brands that are performing better. So it's not just about hitting a number of 65% our sales are in strategic brands. It is -- we continue to see opportunities within that chunk to have more productive inventory. And there's a lot of opportunities out there in [off-price]. And we have our inventories in a position to where we can be on offense and we have the focus directionally where we want to go. So we see those growth opportunities ahead of us and that they're sustainable.Catherine R. SmithWe want to thank you for joining today's call. A replay, along with the slide presentation and prepared remarks, will be available for 1 year on our website. Thank you for your interest in Nordstrom.OperatorThis concludes today's teleconference.

Never be left in the dust again.Nvidia's blazing quarterNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) obliterated Wall Street expectations for Q2 and full-year revenue guidance as demand for its chips remains sky-high amid the race to adopt generative artificial intelligence.Shares climbed as high as 6.6% to $502.66 in Thursday's regular session after the post-close Wednesday print - an all-time high for Nvidia - although the stock retreated to a marginal gain at $471.63 by the end of the day.The chipmaker recorded earnings of $2.70 per share, $0.67 better than consensus, on revenue of $13.51 billion vs. the $11.13B average analyst estimate. Embedded in the sales number was a 171% surge in its high-margin data center business as businesses transition to accelerated computing and generative AI from general-purpose computing.The chipmaker also unveiled an additional $25B stock buyback plan.As AI demand ramps up, Nvidia's suite of AI-related products has become the dominant option for AI-minded startups and businesses. The chipmaker said it expects supply to rise each quarter through next year, and in particular expects Q3 sales of about $16B, give or take 2%, well above the $12B consensus.That ebullient guidance, said Wedbush in a note to clients, ""will be fuel in the engine to ignite a tech rally we see continuing into the rest of the year despite the recent pullback and Fed jitters.""Stifel upgraded Nvidia to Buy from Hold with a price target of $600 on the ""exceptional"" quarter, saying, ""we underestimated the opportunity related to the potential shift of $1 trillion of installed data center infrastructure from general purpose compute to accelerated compute architectures.""Story continuesMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs maintained their buy ratings on the stock, with the former calling Q2 ""another exceptional quarter"" and Goldman writing, ""We expect Nvidia to maintain its status as the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future.""And a notable Nvidia bull at Rosenblatt hiked the price target to an eye-popping $1,100 per share, opining, ""Nvidia’s epic print and guide two quarters in a row is simply unprecedented and just getting started.""Marvell Technology's dull printElsewhere in tech, investors were deflated when Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) posted merely in-line guidance and a slightly better-than-expected fiscal Q2.Shares were down some 5% in Friday's premarket following the post-bell Thursday print, extending on a nearly 7% slide in the prior regular session.Q2 earnings came in at $0.33 per share, a penny better than consensus, and revenue of $1.34B - down 12% from a year earlier - was a hair above the $1.33B Street estimate. For fiscal Q3, Marvell anticipates earnings of $0.40 per share on $1.4B in revenue.CEO Matt Murphy said the growth implied in those expectations ""is being driven primarily by AI and cloud infrastructure.""Snowflake falls despite a big earnings beatCloud concern Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), meanwhile, reported earnings of $0.22 per share after the bell Wednesday, more than double the average Street estimate, on far better-than-expected sales of $674 million - up 36% year-over-year.The company also maintained full-year guidance.BTIG said Snowflake's results were solid and that its ""long-term story is compelling on multiple levels,"" but maintained its Neutral rating on the stock, saying it sees ""a balanced risk/reward"" at current levels.Shares foundered Thursday, losing 5.2% to $147.67.Zoom ahead on earnings; shares take a dipFinally, after the bell Monday, video-chat purveyor Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) said it earned $1.34 per share in its fiscal Q2, well ahead of the $1.06 average estimate, on better-than-expected sales of $1.14.Fiscal Q3 EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.09 was ahead of the $1.03 consensus, and sales are expected at an in-line $1.115B to $1.12B.Needham &amp; Company maintained its Hold rating on the stock, writing, ""we are cautious on meaningful re-acceleration until product diversification improves.""Zoom shares were down more than 2% Tuesday.Ulta, Gap, and Nordstrom deliver better-than-anticipated profitsUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) beat on its Q2 print and full-year guidance after the bell Thursday: EPS totaled $6.02 on $2.53B in sales, whereas analysts were looking for $5.83 per share on $2.5B, while comparable-store sales climbed 8% - a slowdown from 14.4% the prior year. And the full-year profit forecast comes to $25.10 to $25.60 per share on $11.05B to $11.15B, with comps expected to rise 4.5% to 5.5%.Ulta shares were up 1.3% to $428.08 premarket Friday.Also up in Friday's premarket were Gap (NYSE:GPS) shares, which were recently climbing 1.4% to $9.66 after the casual-clothing retailer said Q2 adjusted earnings totaled $0.34 per share, $0.25 better than consensus, on a slightly lower-than-expected top line of $3.55B. Comparable store sales were down 6% over its brands, including Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta, and Q3 sales are seen down in the low double-digits range.Finally, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its full-year guidance Thursday and reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.81, crushing the $0.45 average Street target, on better-than-expected revenue of $3.77B. Still, sales suffered a 275-basis-point hit from its wind-down of Canadian operations, as well as a 12.9% fall in online sales due to elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders in the prior year and the closing down of Trunk Club.Nordstrom shares were ticking down fractionally to $16.75 in recent premarket trading Friday.(Yasin Ebrahim, Davit Kirakosyan, Liz Moyer, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.)Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Nvidia's bang-up Q2; retail's bottom-line beatsFactbox-Companies sell their businesses in RussiaAffirm surges amid growth in customer transaction volumes]"

While Nordstrom's credit card revenues rose 10% in the first half of this year, company executives said Tuesday that delinquencies are now above pre-pandemic levels and could ""result in higher credit losses in the second half and into 2024.""In an earnings call on Wednesday, Kohl's said ""other revenue,"" which is primarily its credit business, declined 3% in the second quarter, sharply down from 11% in the first quarter. The company also announced a new co-branded credit card with Capital One in a bid to attract more customers to its credit segment.U.S. department stores have long offered store credit cards, which often provide savings or points on purchases, as a way to capture sales and grow revenue. However, those cards are typically riskier than traditional credit cards, with higher interest rates and lower credit limits, according to credit reporting consultant John Ulzheimer.Macy’s credit card, for example, has an annual percentage of 31.99% while the national average is 22.39%, according to an August report by WalletHub. Those high interest rates, combined with laxer credit score thresholds, make it more likely that higher-risk consumers will sign up for store cards, according to Ulzheimer.While consumer spending remains relatively resilient according to U.S. retail sales data, investors and experts say rising delinquincies could signal growing pressure on some consumers. The percentage of delinquent payers rose by 23.1% to 38.2% between the second quarters of 2022 and 2023, with the biggest change among consumers in their 40s and 50s, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Story continuesDeclining payment rates could be ""an early sign that consumption is getting weaker,"" said FRED economist and vice president Juan M. Sánchez. Delinquency rates are currently highest among young consumers in their 20s and 30s and those in more economically distressed zip codes.Defaults in credit payments mean department stores are now assuming higher bad debt and write-offs for the year as spending remains pressured in the United States.""For stressed consumers, store cards are one of the first things they may be late or renege on before regular credit cards, car payments, and mortgages which they consider more important,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh and Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Kate Masters in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Crude oil found its footing around one-month lows, but remained on course for a second weekly decline amid a firmer dollar and simmering China-centred worries about global growth.Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at 1405 GMT, while European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde will be taking the stage at 1900 GMT and investors will be looking for clarity on whether more rate increases are in store and how long the Fed plans to hold rates high.""I don't think Powell is going to be declaring victory just yet because, even though inflation is coming down, there's still some risk in the data,"" said Rufaro Chiriseri, head of fixed income for the British Isles at RBC Wealth Management.""The sentiment of higher for longer interest rates is probably going to be echoed by Powell and Lagarde. They will be erring on the side of caution, not saying hikes are gone and done and keeping that optionality on the table.""Fed officials sent mixed signals in the final run-up to the conference. Boston Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told CNBC he doubted the central bank would need to raise rates again, but also indicated he was not ready to predict when rate cuts might begin. Fed President Susan Collins said on Yahoo Finance's video channel that rates may be near or at a peak, ""but certainly additional increments are possible.""Meanwhile, Reuters reported that ECB policymakers are increasingly concerned about deteriorating growth prospects and momentum for a pause in its rate hikes is building, according to sources with direct knowledge of the discussion.Story continuesThe pan European benchmark STOXX 600 index was last up 0.2% and on track for a 0.9% gain this week, which would snap a three-week run of declines.Wall Street futures were pointing to a higher open, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares sagged 1.2% overnight.Japan's Nikkei tumbled 2%, with Nvidia supplier Advantest the biggest drag, dropping almost 10%.The U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against a basket of six developed-market peers, including the euro and yen - pushed as high as 104.31 on Friday, a level last seen in early June.""The recent firmness in the dollar probably factors in some of the markets' expectations for a hawkish tone by Powell,"" said Francesco Pesole, FX strategist at ING.The euro and sterling both fell to their lowest levels since mid-June at $1.0766 and $1.2560, respectively.Against Japan's currency, the dollar edged tentatively back toward last week's nine-month high of 146.545, trading as strong as 146.26.Tokyo consumer price data on Friday, which front-runs nationwide figures, showed inflation remained well above the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) target. However, the lag in pay increases may be more pivotal for steering policy.""We do not expect the Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy because the spike in inflation has not spilled over to a large acceleration in wage growth,"" CBA strategist Joseph Capurso wrote in a client note.At the same time, if Powell is not considered ""hawkish enough"" by currency traders at Jackson Hole, the dollar may ease to around 145 yen to end the week, he said.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda is scheduled to speak at Jackson Hole on Saturday.The Chinese yuan traded slightly weaker in offshore markets , slipping to 7.2929 per dollar. For the week though, it has firmed about 0.2%, pulling away from Thursday's 9-1/2-month trough of 7.349.Euro area and U.S. Treasury yields ticked up, the latter last sitting at 4.2551% - pulling away from the previous session's low of 4.174% but well back from Tuesday's peak of 4.366%, the highest level since November 2007.In energy markets, crude prices rose on Friday, but remained on track for weekly declines of between 0.6% and 1.6%.

It was steady against the yuan at 12.98.Prigozhin's presumed death leaves Russian President Vladimir Putin stronger in the short term, removing a powerful figure who had defied his authority and threatened to make him look weak, but deprives him of a forceful military player.But Prigozhin's influence in Russia has dwindled since the mutiny, meaning volatility for the rouble from his possible death is likely to be limited, said Grzegorz Drozdz, market analyst at investment company Conotoxia.""Russia's central bank and regulators are currently trying to rescue the rouble,"" he said. ""It seems that one of the biggest problems for the Russian currency is the actions of exporters who hold their foreign exchange reserves in the Chinese yuan or Indian rupee, among others.""The rouble strengthened sharply last week after hitting a near 17-month low of 101.75 to the dollar, as the central bank hiked its key rate by 350 basis points to 12% and exporters increased selling of their foreign currency revenue following discussions with Russian authorities.The rouble should be supported by month-end tax payments, where exporters usually convert foreign currency revenues into roubles to meet local liabilities. The peak of those payments falls on Monday, but some analysts have said last week's FX selling increase may have already met their rouble needs.Story continuesBrent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was up 0.7% at $83.98 a barrel.Russian stock indexes were higher.The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 0.2% to 1,046.1 points.

But this source said the company has yet to decide on a potential stake sale or final valuation.Invesco, a minor shareholder in Swiggy, in May valued the Indian company at around $5.5 billion, it said in a filing.Swiggy had initially considered raising $800 million to $1 billion via the IPO, banking sources who worked on it in early 2022 have said.Swiggy, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment, while Bank of America declined to comment.The three sources said Swiggy is aiming to list between July-September 2024 which would be after national elections in India due by May.Swiggy rival Zomato's shares have risen 54.8% so far this year, in a sign that investor confidence is returning to India's financial markets.On Friday, Indian grocery startup Zepto said it has raised $200 million in fresh funding at a valuation of $1.4 billion, making it the first Indian startup to cross the billion-dollar valuation mark in nearly a year.Swiggy in May said its core food delivery business had turned profitable, nine years after starting operations, even as its newer grocery delivery service, Instamart, continues to make losses.

(And yes, it is named after an emoji.)""We're super excited about this round,"" Hugging Face CEO Clément Delangue told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""It’s kind of like a great validation for Hugging Face, but also for open source AI as a whole.

(Photo: Hugging Face)While currently still private, Delangue said he is keen on listing the company's public equity on the Nasdaq when time comes, especially since selling the growth story to investors could prove easier once margins are proven to be sustainable.Semiconductor companies led generative AI-related equity market price action early, and now datasets are gaining traction as generative AI prompts every business to consider where it can increase productivity and create profit producing customer connections.An extremely significant stamp of approval, both large-cap and mega-cap companies who have benefitted the most from early AI demand are participants in this round of funding for Hugging Face.""I think we’ve validated last year that there was massive usage for generative AI,"" Delangue said. ""This year, we’re validating that there’s massive revenue for generative AI — with Nvidia, with the announcement of Hugging Face and others — and hopefully next year, we are going to validate that there’s margins for generative AI too.

Big Tech, like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft; so are all the banks and financial institutions that invested directly; and companies using AI, like IBM and Salesforce,"" Anat Alon-Beck, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, told Yahoo Finance.Some of the big names that experts say are primed to win with Nvidia include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), and IBM (IBM).Amazon and Microsoft are especially key as they have existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. All three companies got shoutouts towards the top of Nvidia's Wednesday earnings call.Two under-the-radar winners who also emerged in Nvidia's earnings call: Snowflake (SNOW) and VMware (VMW), both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships.A notable post-Nvidia spike was Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL): Shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report amid the company's stock hitting a high unseen since April 2022 earlier in the day.

(Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)Ultimately, there's no bigger winner out of Nvidia earnings than Nvidia itself — and the AI boom that's propelled the chipmaker to new heights. Though the AI hype can't last forever, with this latest earnings report, Nvidia and the hype have shown some key resilience.Story continuesThe losers and the question marksNvidia's competitors are clearly in the crosshairs: Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) all saw their shares in the red on Thursday. AMD's seeing the steepest decline, falling as much as 8%.However, it's not curtains for non-Nvidia chipmakers, either — this is a big market and it's still early days, said Alon-Beck.""I know that they definitely compete with each other, but that Nvidia seems to be the one that won Wall Street’s affection,"" Alon-Beck said. ""They are all important, especially with what’s happening in the international arena and the tensions with China. All of them — Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm — are in talks with US officials about the China market. I don’t have a crystal ball but would think that perhaps it’s good for all of them if Nvidia continues to succeed. Yes, competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses, but there is room for all in our current market.""Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, and that could have ramifications down the line. It all looks good mid-hype cycle, but companies are going to have to work to meet the demand for AI by revamping their existing systems over time.

(NYSE:CRM) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$7.46bUS$9.83bUS$11.8bUS$15.1bUS$18.1bUS$20.4bUS$22.2bUS$23.8bUS$25.2bUS$26.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x29Analyst x29Analyst x14Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 12.32%Est @ 9.27%Est @ 7.14%Est @ 5.64%Est @ 4.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$7.0kUS$8.5kUS$9.6kUS$11.4kUS$12.8kUS$13.4kUS$13.6kUS$13.6kUS$13.4kUS$13.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$116bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$26b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$525bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$525b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$260bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$376b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$209, the company appears quite undervalued at a 46% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Salesforce as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for SalesforceStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

46,bfc73268-adf1-307d-8ff3-88c88410ea72,PCG,2023-08-25,Environmental group suffers setback in legal fight to close California's last nuclear power plant,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/environmental-group-suffers-setback-legal-203105327.html,1692909065,STORY,['PCG'],"[A California judge on Thursday rejected an environmental group’s lawsuit that sought to block the state’s largest utility from seeking to extend the operating life of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.Friends of the Earth sued in state Superior Court in April, hoping to derail a state-backed proposal to keep the twin-domed plant running for at least five additional years. The group was part of a 2016 agreement with operator Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to shutter the state's last nuclear power plant by 2025.Amid concerns over power supplies in a changing climate, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature opened the way for PG&amp;E to seek a longer lifespan last year. In legal filings, the environmental group argued that the 2016 deal to close the reactors “is not fully extinguished,” and that the utility would break what it called a binding contract if it asked federal regulators to extend the operating licenses.In an 18-page ruling, Judge Ethan P. Schulman dismissed the complaint, agreeing with the company that Friends of the Earth was asking the court to “impermissibly hinder or interfere” with state regulatory oversight of the seaside plant, located midway between San Francisco and Los Angeles.If the group's request was granted, the court would be placed in conflict with state regulators, and it would “enmesh the court in complex questions of energy, economic and environmental policy” that are best handled by the California Public Utilities Commission and other agencies, Schulman wrote.The group said it might appeal.“The fight to shutter Diablo Canyon is not over,” Hallie Templeton, legal director for Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. The group has a separate case pending in federal court involving regulatory issues tied to the plant's operation and possible extension of the licenses.In a statement, PG&amp;E spokesperson Suzanne Hosn said the company is following California energy policy “and our actions toward relicensing Diablo Canyon Power Plant are consistent with the direction of the state.""Story continuesThe operating license for the Unit 1 reactor expires next year, and the Unit 2 license expires in 2025. The company intends to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of the year to extend operations by as much as two decades.California is the birthplace of the modern environmental movement and for decades has had a fraught relationship with nuclear power, which doesn’t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels but leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries. The Newsom administration is pushing to expand solar power and other clean energy as the state aims to cut emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.Newsom’s decision last year to support a longer operating run for Diablo Canyon shocked environmentalists and anti-nuclear advocates because he had once been a leading voice for closing the plant.The lawsuit represented another mile-marker in a long-running fight over the operation and safety of the decades-old plant, which Newsom says should keep running beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as California transitions to solar and other renewable energy sources.Diablo Canyon produces 9% of the state’s electricity.At this juncture, it’s not clear if the reactors will continue operating beyond the expiration of their licenses in 2024 and 2025 — and if so, for how long — since many regulatory and legal hurdles remain.For example, it’s not yet publicly known what it will cost to update the plant for a longer run given that PG&amp;E was preparing to close it for years. The state could consider backing out if capital costs climb over $1.4 billion - the amount of a forgivable loan the state authorized for PG&amp;E last year as part of the legislative plan to keep the reactors running.Construction at Diablo Canyon began in the 1960s. Critics say potential earthquakes from nearby faults not known to exist when the design was approved could damage equipment and release radiation. One fault was not discovered until 2008. PG&amp;E has long said the plant is safe, an assessment the NRC has supported.The U.S. nuclear industry has been through a tough stretch, with reactors retiring and its share of energy production slipping since 2012. But many industry leaders see a renaissance on the horizon, as climate change has brought attention to carbon-free power.]"

VIAV introduced new testing capabilities for base stations and end-to-end networks, designed to support Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) and High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs). NTN holds great potential in extending network coverage into underserved remote regions while also supporting mission-critical applications. However, testing procedures of 5G satellite communication systems is a complex endeavor.A study conducted by Viavi suggests that the expansion of satellite communications is projected to lead to the deployment of around 30,000 additional satellites in Earth's orbit. This substantial increase underscores the growing demand for robust NTN testing capabilities on a larger scale, presenting an immense opportunity for business expansion in this direction.Amid such growing interest, it is important to prioritize comprehensive testing procedures to ensure the reliability, stability, and optimal performance of NTN and HAP networks. TeraVM, an application emulation and security performance solution combined with TM500 Network Tester, is utilized to match this requirement.The deployment of TM500 plays a vital role in testing the functionality of base stations. It accomplishes this by simulating mobility patterns, signal propagation delays and other distinctive conditions specific to NTNs. Meanwhile, the TeraVM is employed to simulate core network functionalities.Viavi boasts a comprehensive product portfolio that offers end-to-end network visibility and analytics that help build, test, certify, maintain and optimize complex physical and virtual networks. Its strategy of expansion in various markets, such as wireless &amp; fiber, 3D sensing products, optical transport, Ethernet, broadband access, video testing and storage network testing, is likely to bring long-term benefits.The 5G transition is expected to be disruptive, creating new avenues for industries across the board. 5G is likely to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry, which is expected to propel the wide proliferation of IoT. The telecom firms are facilitating their customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation.The convergence of network technologies requires significant investments from both traditional carriers (telecom and cable) and cloud service providers.

We have also covered key trends and developments in the legal industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Highest Paying Countries for Lawyers. Lawyer Shortages in the United StatesThe shortage of lawyers in the US, particularly in rural areas, is reaching a critical point, leading to what are known as ""legal deserts."" This scarcity hinders access to justice, especially in civil matters like wills, divorces, and evictions.Such regions also often have less than one attorney for every 1,000 residents that worsens the challenge. In areas with limited legal representation, people might have to travel long distances for legal assistance or go without it, leading to unequal outcomes in court. However, despite these challenges, the financial landscape of law firms describes a completely opposite story.  How Well are Law Firms Doing Globally?The Global 200 which are the highest-grossing law firms worldwide, amassed a combined revenue exceeding $185.6 billion in 2022. Moreover, the top 100 grossing law firms globally, as ranked by Law.com International, experienced a notable 15.3% uptick in revenue and crossed a cumulative total of over $147 billion. Furthermore, there was an almost 17% surge in average profits per equity partner and crossed $2.2 million in the past year.The promising financial standing of law corporations also translated into higher salaries for lawyers. For example, the average salary of a corporate lawyer is $145,259 in the US.  On the other hand, the highest attorney position is that of a partner at a law firm that is annually paid $230,440 on average. Speaking of high salaries, the highest paid lawyer in the world is Richard Scruggs with a net worth of $1.7 billion. While we have already established that as one of the major industries being revolutionized by AI and automation, the legal industry is one that will highly benefit from the revolution. Let's explore what and how some giants are driving and facilitating this revolution around the world.Story continuesHow is the Legal Industry Being Revolutionized by AI and Digitalization?Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE:TRI) is propelling the legal profession into a new era with its adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI).

50,ab496ecf-0436-390b-b2a5-484204e68f2c,MSFT,2023-08-25,Nvidia's Smashing AI-Fueled Quarter Marks The Official Beginning Of A New Computing Era,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-smashing-ai-fueled-quarter-195831671.html,1692907111,STORY,"['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'AMZN']","[On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) went far beyond estimates with its quarterly performance report. This “drop the mic” moment, as described by Reuters, led to a 6.5% rise of its New York shares in extended trading, adding to its gains this year during which it became the fifth publicly traded U.S. company to join the “trillion-dollar club” whose members are Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN).Moreover, Nvidia’s jaw dropping quarter also lifted other Big Tech stock, including Microsoft who is looking to get its hands on more of Nvidia’s chips, with its stock rising 1.9% during extended trading. Even Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock went up 2.1%. A new computing era has begun and Nvidia is enjoying the results of its bold decision to invest heavily on producing chips that power AI systems long before its rivals Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Micron Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: MU) who focused on servicing markets with existing demand.Smashing Second Quarter ResultsFor the quarter that ended on July 30th, Nvidia’s adjusted revenue amounted to $13.51 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $11.22 billion. Sales have hit a record as they more than doubled, increasing 88%.The data center business, whose output includes the A100 and H100 AI chips that are needed to build and run artificial intelligence applications like Microsoft-backed ChatGPT rose 171% YoY to $10.32 billion, going far beyond analyst estimates of $7.69 billion, according to Refinitiv’s data.The gaming segment rose 22% YoY to $2.49 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $2.4 billion.On the other end, Nvidia is spending big to secure its long-term supply needs as it recorded a 53% jump to $11.15 billion of inventory commitments compared to the previous quarter.Story continuesNet income still skyrocketed from last year’s comparable quarter ($656 million, or 26 cents a share) to $6.19 billion, or $2.48 a share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $2.70 per share, topping Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $2.09.Third quarter outlookWhile Refinitiv’s consensus estimate for revenue was $12.61 billion, Nvidia guided for revenue of about 2% up or down of $16 billion as it expects sales to continue to soar approximately 170% YoY. Adjusted gross margin is expected at 72.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, while Refinitiv’s consensus stood at 70.4%.Analysts are expecting Nvidia’s fiscal 2025 data center revenue to expand to $40 billion due to its leadership in AI chips and software to put those chips to work as they power products like ChatGPT that Microsoft integrated in its 365 offerings. ChatGPT alone was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units that made a supercomputer that Microsoft had built.Q2 Blockbuster Results Reflect Nvidia’s Dominant Position In The AI ChapterThe global demand for Nvidia’s chips is likely to continue intensifying, therefore Nvidia’s main job is to secure the supply chain to meet that demand. Although its rival Advanced Micro Devices is expected to take some market share away next year with its key AI chip, Nvidia’s software still has a years' long lead under its belt. As Wedbush analysts Daniel Ives commented, Nvidia is “the purest and best barometer for AI demand” and its latest quarterly results that smashed Wall Street’s more than ambitious estimates  could have a ripple impact upon the tech industry that has now undoubtedly opened a new chapter in computing history.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then check out 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks in 2023. August 2023 is a crucial month as the stock market pours over the countless earnings reports for the second calendar quarter. The first half of the year saw mega technology cap stocks soar to record high levels, fueled by heightened optimism and expectations about artificial intelligence. At the same time, the fresh earnings report allowed investors and analysts to gauge the impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes on corporate operations, and the dropping inflation's effects on revenues and consumer spending power.The first two technology giants to report earnings this season were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both, like some of their other peers, are at the top of the recent AI wave. Meta, which owns Facebook, is expected to significantly benefit from artificial intelligence when it comes to providing users with advertisements and content recommendations based on their previous Facebook use and preferences in general. Facebook also announced a new artificial intelligence model in August through which it aims to enable users who speak different languages to communicate with each other.On the earnings front, Meta reported $2.98 in adjusted earnings per share which marked a 16% annual growth. Revenue for the firm stood at $31.9 billion after growing by 11% annually. The earnings report also provided details about Meta's costly bet on the metaverse which not only saw the firm plow billions of dollars into the technology last year but also change its name to reflect the change. This bet came at the wrong time as far as the stock market was concerned, as investors were looking for cost cutting at a time of high interest rates and high inflation. This led to Meta's shares being one of the worst performing stocks in 2022, but the shares have roared back to life this year as they are up by 136% year to date.Story continuesMicrosoft, which is another firm at the heart of the AI wave, grew its revenue by 8% annually as it reported $56.2 billion in net sales. However, the firm's guidance for the current quarter failed to impress investors and its shares slipped on the stock market as a result. Alphabet's results were far more impressive than Microsoft's as the firm beat analyst revenue estimates and posted $74.6 billion in revenue to mark a 7% annual growth.Finally, the remaining two tech titans, namely Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed a mixed bag of results that reflected the current economic turmoil and uncertainty. Starting off with Apple, the largest technology company in the world relied on its services segment to beat top and bottom line analyst estimates. However, Apple, which relies on high end, premium products to earn its keep, saw its revenue drop by 1% annually with its hardware segment leading the drop as consumers felt a pinch to their purchasing power. Amazon, on the other hand, roared on the same day that Apple sounded a bit meek, as it beat analyst estimates for both revenue and net income and also surpassed the guidance estimates for the current quarter.As to why Amazon managed to thrive in a tough consumer economy, here's what the firm's management had to say during the earnings call for the quarter:Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores’ fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn’t matter much to customers.This argument is incorrect. There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It’s also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There’s a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms.So which are the most profitable technology companies in 2023?

But perhaps the most important news came during the company’s earnings call when CFO Colette Kress attempted to assuage investors’ concerns about a supply crunch and the impact of further US sanctions against China.Nvidia, Kress told analysts, is well positioned on both fronts.“Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs,” Kress said. “We have also developed and qualified additional capacities and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process.”According to Kress, Nvidia expects supplies to increase each quarter through next year, which should help the company meet the massive ramp-up in demand it’s experiencing as the AI craze continues to pick up steam.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds the Grace hopper system at COMPUTEX 2023. (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)In the latest quarter, Q2, Nvidia’s revenue jumped some 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, while earnings per share rose 429% to $2.70. And demand isn’t slowing, as the company said it expects to bring in $16 billion in revenue in the current quarter, plus or minus 2%. That’s well ahead of analysts’ forecast of $12.5 billion.Kress also hit on whether additional US sanctions on selling high-end chips to China would take a bite out of Nvidia’s revenue moving forward: She said the company shouldn’t face any problems.“We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results given the strength of demand for our products worldwide,” Kress said. “We do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact or financial results.”Proving the big names are still buyingIn addition to tamping down on fears that Nvidia could face an inventory shortfall — or that it will be hurt by increasing tensions between the US and China — Kress pointed to a number of big-name companies that continue to buy up Nvidia’s products.“Data center … revenue nearly tripled year on year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies,” she said.Story continues“Major companies including AWS (AMZN), Google Cloud (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Oracle Cloud (ORCL), as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers, are deploying, in volume, HDX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture tensor core GPUs.”Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)As for how long Nvidia can keep up this kind of growth, CEO Jensen Huang pointed to the enormity of the global data center market — and the need for companies to lean further into accelerated computing and AI.“There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spent each year. You're seeing that the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today: accelerated computing and generative AI,” Huang said.“This is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition. And we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time,” he added.Nvidia, though, needs to ensure it can hold on to its lead in the chip space throughout that transition. But with rivals AMD, Intel, and others looking to topple the AI giant, that could be a difficult task.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

One such stock that merits attention is Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). The stock, currently priced at 25.32, recorded a loss of 4.6% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 16.17%. The stock's fair valuation is $45.72, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with WBA. Click here to check it out. WBA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WBAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA): A Value Trap in Disguise?Walgreens Boots Alliance: A Potential Value Trap?However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Walgreens Boots Alliance should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.76. This indicator suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnpacking the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: Walgreens Boots AllianceWalgreens Boots Alliance is one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the U.S., with over 8,500 locations. Nearly three quarters of Americans live within five miles of a Walgreens location. Roughly two thirds of revenue is generated from prescription drug sales; Walgreens makes up 20% of total prescription revenue in the U.S. Walgreens also generates sales from retail products (general wellness consumables and its own branded merchandise), European drug wholesale, and healthcare. With more locations incorporating additional services like Health Corner and Village Medical, Walgreens creates an omnichannel experience for patients and positions itself as a one-stop healthcare provider.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA): A Value Trap in Disguise?Dissecting Walgreens Boots Alliance's Low Altman Z-ScoreA dissection of Walgreens Boots Alliance's Altman Z-score reveals Walgreens Boots Alliance's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Walgreens Boots Alliance's historical data, 2021: 0.38; 2022: 0.42; 2023: 0.34, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Walgreens Boots Alliance's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.03; 2022: 0.07; 2023: -0.05) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Walgreens Boots Alliance might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Walgreens Boots Alliance is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 1.44; 2022: 1.48; 2023: 1.43 from the past three years suggests a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Walgreens Boots Alliance's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.Conclusion: Navigating the Value TrapDespite the apparent undervaluation of Walgreens Boots Alliance, it exhibits signs of a potential value trap. The company's low Altman Z-Score and declining operational efficiency ratios indicate potential financial distress and reduced operational effectiveness. These factors underscore the importance of in-depth analysis and due diligence before making investment decisions. The allure of a seemingly undervalued stock may be deceptive, and investors should tread with caution.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

I was hit by a car while walking in a crosswalk in Tel Aviv, Israel. For several days after, I was in the ICU at a local hospital, unconscious and suffering from internal bleeding; a broken pelvis, wrist and leg, and a knee LCL and ACL tear.When waking me for the first time, the doctors realized something was wrong. I had suffered a stroke while unconscious. I ended up staying in the hospital for six weeks until I was cleared to fly back to the U.S. to continue my recovery. I moved to two hospitals before going to Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRA) in Chicago. SRA is where I learned to speak, write, use my left hand and walk again.I deal with ongoing effects from the accident. I have nerve damage in my right leg that causes shooting pain and some loss of feeling. It has caused a permanent limp and I can't run. Climbing stairs is slow and hard, and I have occasional pelvis pain. I also have ""left neglect,"" which refers to a deficit in awareness that occurs following an injury to the brain's right side. Because of the injury, my brain has difficulty with some left hemisphere functions like speech and comprehension. When I'm tired or stressed out, my words can get jumbled and it can be hard for me to communicate effectively.Despite this, the greatest lesson I've taken from my accident is to be open and share. I was a very private person before, but now I've learned that sharing our stories can help others and bring us closer together. I've also learned to ask for help and tell people what you need.I have been with Walgreens for 16 years and am an art director on the pharmacy concept team in Marketing. I primarily focus on design for all things immunizations, but also work on Medicare, pharmacy services, VillageMD and U.S. Healthcare. I have been so lucky to work with some fantastic people in my career. When I was recovering from my accident, they sent videos and care packages, and were amazing support in my recovery. They were understanding and provided coverage while I underwent therapy at SRA until I could ramp up from part-time to full-time work again.Story continuesIn a typical day, I wake up to the sounds of my 2-and-a-half-year-old son, Dylan, singing ""Old McDonald"" or ""Wheels on the Bus"" over the baby monitor. My husband and I get him off to daycare, I brew a Nespresso and settle in to my desk for a day of remote work, which I do most of the time.I design store signage, flyers, digital ads, social posts and more. If you've seen any flu shot or COVID-19 vaccines artwork in the last few years, there's a good chance I designed it! The larger creative team at Walgreens is the best. Everyone is so smart, and I love how we work together to get everything done.I am the communications lead for both Women of WBA and disAbility Alliance business resource groups (BRGs). BRGs are an invaluable resource here at Walgreens and make it possible to find close communities at a large company. The connections and friendships I've made through these groups are invaluable. The most impactful events I've helped plan are when team members get the chance to share their stories surrounding their personal conditions that inevitably affect their work lives; for example, fertility issues. I feel empowered that I'm helping to amplify people's stories and foster connections. Our diversity and differences strengthen the culture at WBA.I'm also on the steering committee for the American Heart Association Heart Walk and I'm very passionate about raising money for research, especially as a stroke survivor.I live in the suburbs of Chicago, so if it's a nice day I'll try to sit outside on my patio. That said, sitting or standing for too long hurts my leg and pelvis, so I try to keep moving or go for a walk, or do a Peloton ride or Pilates class over my lunch hour. I also do acupuncture every other week to help with nerve pain. After my accident, we moved into a ranch house so I don't have to deal with stairs. It's very nice having the flexibility and support from my manager to work from home most days, so I don't have to deal with commuting, especially on what I call ""bad leg days,"" when the pain is difficult to manage. I do love connecting in person for strategic sessions with the broader business and design team, but am grateful the majority of my work can be done remotely.I try to wrap up any work by 5 p.m. so I can spend quality time with my son and husband. My son is my miracle; after my accident I didn't know if I could get pregnant or have a child. I'm so grateful for him every day.When our son goes to bed around 8 p.m., my husband and I will either watch something together (we're huge sports and prestige TV fans) or we will go our separate ways (I can only take so much baseball, and he can't take my reality TV habit!).I'm grateful that my role at Walgreens allows me to be creative and come up with new ideas. I was an art major in college, and design and aesthetics are my passions. I love that I get to ""make pictures for a living,"" while helping our customers and patients get the valuable health information they need.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Thursday, August 24, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Walgreens Boots Alliance on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Walgreens Boots AllianceWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/walgreens-boots-allianceEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Walgreens Boots AllianceView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/776655/Meet-Jamie-Fintz-Art-Director-Marketing-Walgreens]"

The company confirmed an internal test of ""scanless pay,"" a new contactless checkout method that would leverage a Starbucks app's user's current geolocation to identify them in the drive-through lane so they wouldn't have to pull out their phone to pay.The experience is currently only being tested as a proof-of-concept with Starbucks employees, the company told TechCrunch. It doesn't have a set date as to when such a feature would launch to consumers, or even if it will.If it did, however, such an innovation would likely speed up drive-through times, as customers wouldn't have to launch the Starbucks app, display their barcode, then wait for the employee to scan their screen -- something that can often be tricky in bright sunlight or when the customer isn't well-positioned at the drive-through window. Instead, a scanless checkout system would allow the employee to simply hand over the customer's order and have them then be on their way.This could also potentially impact the company's bottom line as the drive-through could serve more customers in a shorter amount of time.The new technology was discovered by developer and researcher Steve Moser, who found references to scanless pay in the current version of the Starbucks mobile app. Additional text in the app explained ""Scanless pay in the drive-through helps you get your order fast. We use your device's location services to identify you when you arrive so you don't have to pull out your wallet or device when paying at the drive-through.""The app indicated the feature was available in select locations, but the company told us it's not open to consumers at this time.Currently, the system works by asking the user to opt into the feature. Once enabled, customers would check in on the mobile app when they arrive at a participating drive-through store, then tell the barista their name and that they've checked in, after placing their order. While this system doesn't mean you can leave your phone at home, customers likely have enough time to fiddle with this extra step while waiting in the drive-through line. Then, when they approach the window, there isn't anything else to do but accept your order and move on.Story continuesThe development is interesting to note because of Starbucks' leadership in novel payment solutions. Well before Apple Pay became as ubiquitous as it is today, Starbucks was pioneering the concept of the digital wallet at checkout. Today, its Mobile Order &amp; Pay system for ordering ahead plays a significant role in generating company revenue. In Q2 2023, for example, the company noted that combined with drive-through and delivery, Mobile Order &amp; Pay accounted for 74% of U.S. company-owned revenue, in fact.""As we continue to innovate and invest in the Starbucks Experience for our partners (employees) and customers, we are always testing and exploring new features to ensure an effortless, delightful, and personalized experience for our customers and partners,"" a Starbucks spokesperson said, confirming the test to TechCrunch.Starbucks isn't the only retailer to test out scanless payment tech, of course. Amazon has been developing its own Just Walk Out technology that uses camera systems, an app and machine learning tech to determine what a customer bought at a store so they could just leave when shopping is complete. The retailer has also been developing a palm-scanning system, Amazon One, used by various venues and retailers, including Panera Bread. The downside of Amazon's systems is that customers aren't comfortable with the biometrics involved -- having their palm scanned to track them, that is. Starbucks' scanless system, on the other hand, wouldn't be much different from grocery pickup apps like Instacart or even Starbucks mobile ordering, where you temporarily provide location access so the store knows you're on your way.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/starbucks-is-experimenting-with-scanless-checkout-for-drive-through-users/]"

But you can make better returns by buying undervalued shares. Notably, the Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) share price has gained 22% in three years, which is better than the average market return. In contrast, the stock is actually down 18% in the last year, suggesting a lack of positive momentum.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Sysco There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Sysco was able to grow its EPS at 102% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 7% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Sysco has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Sysco's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Sysco the TSR over the last 3 years was 32%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveSysco shareholders are down 16% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 6.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.5%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sysco better, we need to consider many other factors.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland How Quickly Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown EPS by 35% per year, compound, in the last three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Archer-Daniels-Midland maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 5.8% to US$100b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Archer-Daniels-Midland's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Archer-Daniels-Midland Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$43b company like Archer-Daniels-Midland. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$265m. This comes in at 0.6% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that Archer-Daniels-Midland has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Archer-Daniels-Midland's continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. We should say that we've discovered 1 warning sign for Archer-Daniels-Midland that you should be aware of before investing here.Although Archer-Daniels-Midland certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Synopsys (SNPS) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of software used to test and develop chips a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Synopsys is 15.9%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 24.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 10.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Synopsys is 25.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 8.2%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Synopsys have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.7% over the past month.Bottom LineSynopsys has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Synopsys is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition. The role of software is constantly evolving. With the continuation of remote work setup and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, the demand for voice and video communication and productivity software is expected to increase exponentially. These trends bode well for industry participants like Adobe ADBE, Salesforce CRM and Synopsys SNPS.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (primarily for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform. Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design, manufacturing and digital media.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Software IndustryHigher Spending on Software Aids Prospects: The industry’s prospects are bright, given higher spending by enterprises on software procurement. Continued investment in big data and analytics and the ongoing adoption of software as a service or SaaS opens up opportunities for industry players. Cloud offers a flexible and cost-effective platform for developing and testing applications. The deployment time is also shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.Cloud Computing Adoption Gaining Traction: The increasing need to secure cloud platforms amid growing cyber-attacks and hacking incidents drives demand for cyber security software. Enterprises are focused on rapid migration to the cloud and DevOps technologies to achieve scalability and agility for software development and IT operations. This helps deliver a flawless digital experience to clients. This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.Macroeconomic Headwinds a Concern: The mainstream adoption of the distributed workforce model is fueling demand for enterprise communication, workspace management and human capital management software solutions. However, global macroeconomic weakness, prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and volatile supply chain dynamics are concerns. Increasing inflation could affect spending across small- and medium-sized businesses globally. The uncertainty in business visibility could dent the industry’s performance in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #78, which places it in the top 32% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

67,6c12e7d3-ed07-3c02-9f62-58288fbeb968,WU,2023-08-25,Western Union (NYSE:WU) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.235,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-union-nyse-wu-paying-102459627.html,1692959099,STORY,['WU'],"[The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) will pay a dividend of $0.235 on the 29th of September. This means the annual payment is 7.9% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Based on the last dividend, Western Union is earning enough to cover the payment, but then it makes up 108% of cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 10.4%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 56%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.40 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.94. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 8.9% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Western Union has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 15% per annum. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.In SummaryOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. While Western Union is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've identified 4 warning signs for Western Union (3 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

68,65e0f4d3-680c-3349-bfba-ee8d3ad498e7,HCA,2023-08-25,Is UnitedHealth (UNH) a Good Dividend Stock Choice for You?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-unh-good-dividend-stock-151500655.html,1692890100,STORY,"['UNH', 'HCA']","[UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH recently announced a dividend payout of $1.88 per share, maintaining its commitment to stockholder returns. The latest dividend will be paid out on Sep 19, 2023, to its shareholders of record as of Sep 11.Its dividend yield, based on the latest payout and the Aug 23 closing price, is approximately 1.54%. The figure is higher than the industry average of 1.31% and the medical sector, as well as the S&amp;P 500’s level of 1.45%. UnitedHealth’s dividend history shows continuous hikes per annum since 2010.Its shareholder value boosting efforts are backed by a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash-generating ability. UNH exited the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $46.3 billion, which soared 65.8% from the 2022-end level, while the short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt were at a manageable $6.3 billion. It expects operating cash flow for 2023 to be within $27-$28 billion, implying growth from $26.2 billion in 2022.This highlights UNH’s sound and stable financial position, backed by its strong profitable operations. As a result, the dividend not only looks quite sustainable but also leaves enough scope for future dividend hikes.Investors should note that Optum, UnitedHealth’s health service business, is becoming increasingly valuable and supports its diversification strategy. Its long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to up the dividend for years to come. Our estimate for Optum's top line suggests an increase of 20.3% year over year in 2023.An uptrend in membership trends in UNH’s Commercial business is also a major positive for the health insurer. Moreover, UnitedHealth’s government business, which consists of Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, is expected to continue boosting its performance in the coming days. The company also has a share repurchase program in place to enhance shareholder value, which had up to 21 million shares capacity left at June-end.Story continuesPrice Performance   UnitedHealth shares have gained 2.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 2.9% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUnitedHealth currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It envisions healthy demand to continue in most of its end markets in the third quarter of 2023.Demand in non-residential construction, the company’s biggest market, increased in the second quarter. Based on the current customer state and backlogs, the company remains cautiously optimistic that non-residential construction activity in the sectors in which it participates will continue to be healthy in the third quarter.Commercial aerospace demand also remained substantial in the second quarter. RS expects commercial aerospace demand to improve further in the third quarter as build rates grow from 2022 levels. Moreover, demand in Reliance Steel's aerospace business's military, defense and space segments remained robust, with substantial backlogs. The trend is projected to continue in the third quarter.Reliance Steel is also seeing higher demand for toll processing services for the automobile market. Its position in the automotive sector, together with recent advances in car production and the ongoing trend to increased aluminum content, gives the company confidence that demand for its toll processing services will remain strong in the third quarter.Moreover, RS has been following an aggressive acquisition strategy for a while as part of its core business policy to drive operating results. The acquisitions of Rotax Metals, Admiral Metals and Nu-Tech Precision Metals are in sync with its strategy of investing in high-quality businesses. The acquisition of Southern Steel Supply also expands the company’s reach in the Southern United States and boosts its value-added processing services.Story continuesPricing Pressure AilsThe company continued to face pricing pressure in the second quarter. The second-quarter average selling price per ton sold declined 19% from the year-ago quarter. Reliance Steel expects average selling price per ton sold to be down 2-4% sequentially in the third quarter factoring in lower prices for flat-rolled products as well as carbon steel tubing products. Lower selling prices are expected to affect its third-quarter performance.Lower sequential shipments are also expected to impact the company top line in the third quarter. Reliance Steel expects a 2-4% decline in tons sold in the third quarter from the second quarter. The decline is expected to be driven by planned customer shutdowns and vacations schedules as well as one less shipping day. Reliance Steel &amp; Aluminum Co.

(NYSE:GS) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Thus, you can purchase Goldman Sachs Group's shares before the 30th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 28th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$2.75 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$11.00 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Goldman Sachs Group stock has a trailing yield of around 3.4% on the current share price of $319.96. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Goldman Sachs Group's payout ratio is modest, at just 42% of profit.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see Goldman Sachs Group's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 21% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Goldman Sachs Group has delivered 19% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Goldman Sachs Group an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? When companies are growing rapidly and retaining a majority of the profits within the business, it's usually a sign that reinvesting earnings creates more value than paying dividends to shareholders. This is one of the most attractive investment combinations under this analysis, as it can create substantial value for investors over the long run. We think this is a pretty attractive combination, and would be interested in investigating Goldman Sachs Group more closely.In light of that, while Goldman Sachs Group has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - Goldman Sachs Group has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal joins the Live show to break down the latest news.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: America just can't get enough of Barbie. Greta Gerwig's box office blowout starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has become the top-grossing film of the year at the domestic box office. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has those details. Hey, Ally.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle. That's right. Barbie is number one at the domestic box office, surpassing Universal's Super Mario Bros. Movie. And let's break down the numbers here.You'll see on your screen that Barbie was able to nab that number one spot with $575.4 million, surpassing the $574.2 million that Mario had earlier this year. And it's worth noting that Barbie was able to grab that spot at a far faster pace, just 35 days after its release compared to the 138 days it took Mario to reach that benchmark. So globally, that means Barbie has more than $1.3 billion in worldwide ticket sales, just a huge win for the box office. A huge win for director Greta Gerwig, who is now the sole female director to reach that $1 billion club. And now Barbie, along with Oppenheimer, really helping to lift that late summer box office, which has even rivaled pre-pandemic levels at some times.So far, this summer, it's actually up 16%, compared to where we were last year. However, we're still lagging overall, about 5% compared to 2019. We did see some underperformers earlier this summer, like Disney's Elemental, The Little Mermaid, Indiana Jones, The Flash, all disappointing when it came to those market expectations. But with Barbie, Oppenheimer, we were able to finally end the summer season with a bang. We'll see if that can continue through the fall.But it's interesting to note that on Sunday, it's National Cinema Day. And moviegoers, they can get $4 tickets to any movie, any place, any time. That's certainly going to help boost foot traffic, and some of those box office receipts.Story continuesAnd on Wednesday, Warner Brothers also announced that Barbie is going to have a limited one-week run later in September on IMAX screens. So that should be interesting. And it will also feature some never-before-seen post-credit footage that was selected by Gerwig herself. So a lot of optimism surrounding the theatrical release schedule right at this point. However, of course, hanging in the background is just an ongoing strike, and what that's going to mean for the future of the box office.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And I mean, a lot of people wondering, was Barbie going to break through the noise, when-- it wasn't a superhero movie. It wasn't a sequel to something else. But, I mean, the run-up to it. I mean, even from the moment that it was announced, people were already excited. I already like to wear a lot of pinks.So I was already ready. I didn't have to buy a new outfit. But I was all the way ready for it. But do you think-- have we peaked now? Has Barbie just really set the bar super high for the rest of the year?ALEXANDRA CANAL: It's hard to think that we could recreate the magic that was Barbie. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. The marketing surrounding this. The hype.There was Barbie everything. There was Airbnb postings of Barbie houses. I mean, you really couldn't predict the amount of hype that would surround this movie. And that's going to be really hard to replicate.However, I think it does set the stage for more female-driven stories. I think consumers are beginning to tire of the same old, same old superhero male-dominated action film. We've actually seen those disappoint in recent weeks. So I think it sets us up for a different type of movie. And I'm sure studios are talking about that currently.So that's encouraging, because I loved it. I agree with you, Rachelle. I showed up in my pink-- there I am in the pink Barbie hat. My pink workout gear. And the line here was insane.It was just so crazy to be involved in something like this. The hype was insane. And we'll see if we're able to recreate that with another type of film. But if anyone was going to do it, it was going to be Barbie. Absolutely.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Oh, absolutely. My daughter, my niece. It was their birthday.It was a whole crew of kids. Everybody was in their pink, kitted out, and were ready. So I absolutely loved it as well.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Love it.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, it's great to have you on. Our very own Ally Canal Thanks so much.]"

HOLX is well poised for growth in coming quarters, backed by continued recovery in procedural volumes and an acceleration from the new business lines.  The company’s expanded global installed base of more than 3,250 Panthers instruments represents the catalyst for Hologic’s sustained growth. However, stiff competition and currency headwinds do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 5.8% compared with a 4% decline of the industry and a 5.9% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $18.54 billion. Its earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2023 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.7%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayMolecular Diagnostics Growth Continues: Within Molecular Diagnostics, Hologic’s recently-acquired Biotheranostics also continues to shine, being the top and the bottom line.The company’s expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong, marks the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. Panther's superior workflow, combined with a broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for customers and differentiates Hologic’s from competitors.Strength in GYN Surgical: GYN Surgical's growth continues to be driven by strong contributions from a hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure, the Fluent fluid management system and NovaSure. The company is encouraged by strong performance from its latest NovaSure iteration, the NovaSure V5. The laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division. Through Acessa and Bolder acquisitions, the company integrated Acessa’s procedure and Bolder’s advanced vessel sealing portfolio into its product line.Growth Initiatives: To streamline its operations and reduce the cost of revenues, Hologic has been adopting a few significant strategies over the past few years. The company has invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where management has recognized a good return. These include Hologic’s Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. Per management, these strategic initiatives are already paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains and price stability, which will contribute to the company’s sales.Story continuesDownsidesForeign Exchange Headwinds: We are apprehensive about the challenges Hologic faces due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts that have been affecting the company’s overall performance in the past few quarters.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCompetitive Landscape: Hologic operates in a highly competitive industry.

But, what if those eyes had been on their brokerage accounts instead of their increasingly enormous flat-screen TVs?Here’s a look at where your net worth might be today if you had used the money spent on your Netflix subscription to invest in Netflix stock instead.The Media Disruptor Made Early Investors RichCorporate executives Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph created Netflix in 1997, went live with Netflix.com in 1998 and launched a groundbreaking and Blockbuster-killing DVD-by-mail subscription service in 1999. On May 23, 2002, the public got its first crack at Netflix when its stock began trading on the Nasdaq at an IPO price of $15 per share.As of Aug. 23, 2023, it has earned its original investors a return of 35,684%.“If you had invested $10,000 in Netflix stock on August 1, 2003, 20 years later on August 1, 2023, you would have $4,386,200,” said Nancy D. Butler, a certified financial planner for more than 35 years and the owner of Above All Else, Success in Life and Business.That, however, is an unlikely scenario.“In 2011, Netflix stock had a 60.56% loss and in 2022, it had a 51.05% loss. Most people don’t buy and hold a stock for 20 years, especially when they see large losses in any year.”Find Out: Dave Ramsey Used These 4 Investment Rules To Build His WealthHow Much, Exactly, Have I Spent Watching Netflix?Butler’s hypothetical doesn’t illustrate how you might have invested your streaming budget because — hopefully — you haven’t spent $10,000 as a Netflix subscriber.Story continuesNetflix introduced America to the concept of streaming video on demand in 2007, but it required members to subscribe to its traditional DVD-by-mail service to participate. On top of that, members paid according to how much content they consumed. For example, $18 a month bought you 18 hours of streaming.What’s almost lost to history is that Blockbuster nearly won the rental wars with its Total Access program in 2006, which let subscribers receive DVDs in the mail and return them to the chain’s physical locations. But in 2008, Netflix fought its way off the ropes and brought streaming into the modern era with a consistent and streamlined subscription policy that made binging possible.That’s where this storyline begins, presuming a standard-tier subscription level the entire time and rounding up Netflix’s prices by one penny for the sake of round numbers.2008-2010: $9In 2008, Netflix launched unlimited streaming of its 90,000-title library for $9 per month, where it would remain through 2010.36 months at $9 per month: $3242011-2013: $8In 2011, Netflix lowered the price of its standard package to $8, but it made up for it by jacking up the cost of its DVDs, which still accounted for many of its titles. The result was nearly universal customer outrage and the 2011 stock price crash that Butler described. On Oct. 25, 2011, Netflix suffered its biggest single-day drop when shares fell 34.9% after the company reported a net loss of 800,000 subscribers.36 months at $8 per month: $288April 2014-October 2015: $9In the spring of 2014, Netflix continued tinkering with its subscription tiers. While SD consumers could stay on for $8, those who wanted HD streaming had to spend another buck.18 months at $9 per month: $162October 2015-October 2017: $10Netflix keeps its basic package at $8 while increasing its standard package by another dollar, where it stays for two years.24 months at $10 per month: $240October 2017-January 2019: $11Netflix continues to phase all tiers to higher prices, with the cost of a standard subscription increasing by a dollar yet again.14 months at $11 per month: $154January 2019-October 2020: $13Instead of continuing its phase-in, Netflix simultaneously hikes prices across all tiers for the first time in company history. This time, standard subscribers get a $2 increase.21 months at $13 per month: $273October 2020-January 2022: $14With the pandemic making streaming more of a necessity than an amenity, Netflix sees room for another increase.15 months at $14 per month: $210January 2022 to the present: $15.50At the start of last year, Netflix added $1.50 to its standard subscription price, where it remains today.20 months at $15.50 per month: $310And If I Had Invested All That Instead of Streaming It?If you’ve been a Netflix subscriber since 2008 when the platform first allowed unlimited streaming, you would have spent $1,961 to binge “Squid Game,” “Stranger Things,” “Orange is the New Black,” and the rest of its hit shows between then and now.In 2008, Netflix (NFLX) averaged about $4.10 per share, although that number accounts for two stock splits, a 2:1 before and a 7:1 later.Therefore, the $1,961 you spent for a 15-year movie night could have bought you just over 478 shares of company stock. Today, Netflix is trading at around $408, which means you’d have $195,024 if you had invested in Netflix instead of watching it.Really makes you think.More From GOBankingRates5 Things You Must Do When Your Retirement Savings Reaches $100,0007 Frugal Habits That Aren't Actually Good for Your Finances3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Here's How To Build a 6-Month Emergency FundThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Rich Would You Be If You Invested In Netflix Stock Instead of a Subscription?]"

Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick joins the Live show to discuss the state of the consumer, unemployment rate, student loan payments, and the effect on the economy.Sosnick said, ""People have jobs. The unemployment rate is flirting with record lows. Those who want a job have one. And when people have jobs, they can and do spend money. But I think people are getting a bit more nervous, they are a bit more cautious.""Video Transcript- And as we wrap up the big retail results for this earnings season, we have to look back at the trends and what they tell us about the consumer. When you look at the same store sales growth for the quarter of a lot of retailers, they saw declines with just a few posting some gains.Some received praise for their results just because their declines weren't as bad as investors thought they would be of the companies that did see year over year sales growth. And here were some interesting ones-- Abercrombie and Fitch shocking the markets. They saw a huge bump up about 13%.Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Dorsey spoke with the retailer's CEO Fran Horowitz about this.FRAN HOROWITZ: Yeah, so I would say the team consumer is definitely more pressured. That's what we started to see last year and still seeing it today. But the consumer is shopping, and they're going to continue to shop. They're just making choices on who they're shopping with, and they're choosing our brand.- So we've seen that consumers continue to spend just not on big ticket items. We saw it in retail sales last week, which surprised everyone with how much people are shopping. So let's bring back in Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers chief strategist. They're still shopping, but they're being a little bit more picky or choosy about where they're placing value in their purchases right now clearly.Story continuesSTEVE SOSNICK: Perfect way to lead into that. Yes, it's exactly what I think we're seeing. Remember, the consumer is still 2/3 of the economy. And so we really have to be concerned with what consumers are doing. But people have jobs, right? The unemployment rate is flirting with record lows. And so those who want a job have one. And when people have jobs, they can and do spend money.But I think people are getting a bit more nervous. They're a bit more cautious. You know, remember, call it a third of the country is-- sorry-- dealing with energy bills that they've never had to deal with before. That's got to come from someplace. You know, a huge segment of the population is going to have to start paying their student loan payments again, which that money's got to come from someplace. And so as a result, I think consumers have the money to spend.They are spending, but they're being very selective. And I think also, there's a very big value proposition in where they're spending it. You saw Walmart same store sales increase. TJ Maxx same store sales increase kind of at the expense of Target, which was better than feared but still down.And Abercrombie, you know, was a big winner. I'm too old and too heavy to shop there. But the footwear stocks got-- people-- the younger consumer with a little money in his or her pocket is going Abercrombie. They're not going to Foot Locker. They're not buying Nike's this time around. Fashion moves in cycles.And I do-- so I do think what we're seeing is caution. Not concern, but some of the-- but we did really punish some of the losers, the broad line-- a lot of the broad line retailers when you think about Macy's and I know Brian Sozzi's favorite Kohl's.- How do we bring all this back to the inflation picture? Because you think about the retail, the overall retail sales number that we got 2 weeks ago now was a blowout, then you have all these really choppy retail numbers.You would think with the hot retail sales number, that would have negative implications for inflation in terms of not allowing it to abate as much. But of course as always, it's murkier now that we've got all the individual ones. So how do we factor all that in?STEVE SOSNICK: I think this is the kind of thing that Powell is going to allude to tomorrow is that the consumer is healthy. They're spending their money. It does allow some certain segments to pass along price increases, which does fuel inflation. And so the cautious consumer-- a cautious consumer doesn't mean the consumer has gone away. It just means that they've changed the mix of their spending, and they're trying to spend it more on staples.But we really haven't heard from, let's say, the consumer goods companies saying that they're cutting prices. They may not have-- this quarter, they may not have passed along as many price increases that they did the prior quarter. But you didn't hear of anybody saying, demand stinks, we're going to have to start cutting. And so until or unless that happens or until or unless they say we cannot raise prices, you have to assume that they at least, will try until it's proven otherwise.]"

(ROST) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-inc-rost-hit-131503520.html,1692882903,STORY,"['ROST', 'TJX']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Ross Stores (ROST)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $122.7 in the previous session. Ross Stores has gained 5% since the start of the year compared to the 16.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 4.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 17, 2023, Ross Stores reported EPS of $1.32 versus consensus estimate of $1.17.For the current fiscal year, Ross Stores is expected to post earnings of $5.19 per share on $19.94 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.49% change in EPS on a 6.66% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.71 per share on $20.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.03% and 4.78%, respectively.Valuation MetricsRoss Stores may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ross Stores has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 23.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 22X versus its peer group's average of 17.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.03. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ross Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ross Stores fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ross Stores shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does ROST Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ROST have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX). TJX has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. The TJX Companies, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 11.84%, and for the current fiscal year, TJX is expected to post earnings of $3.69 per share on revenue of $53.61 billion.Shares of The TJX Companies, Inc. have gained 3% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 24.36X and a P/CF of 21.26X.The Retail - Discount Stores industry is in the top 24% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ROST and TJX, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most historic stock indexes in America, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world. It was set up in 1896 and holds a central place in the history of the stock market as a result. This also lends the index a special status where the stocks that are included in it are called blue chip stocks, which alludes to their high value and overall stability.Stocks included in the Dow index do not stay there forever. The index in its current form which is limited to 30 stocks came into being in 1928 when it was expanded to reflect the roaring market conditions of the time. This time period was one of the most prosperous in the early history of the Dow index, as 1928 marked an eight year bull run that had started in 1920. It started after the end of the first world war which had left an economic recession in the United States and it would end with much worse economic circumstances coming in as the Great Depression would start. In terms of percentage point drops in economic activity, the Great Depression would be fifteen times as bad as the contraction during the Great Recession after the economic crisis in 2008. Like the housing crisis, the Great Depression also began in the U.S. and then spread all over the world, with stocks believed to have lost more than three quarters of value during the time period.After the Great Depression, the next period of turbulence in the Dow would come during the 1970s when the U.S. shifted away from gold and Saudi Arabia led an oil embargo that led to severe inflation all across America along with dropping economic growth as the pumps dried up. The stock market, which as a whole relies on economic growth and prosperity, does not like any turbulence in either the oil supply or the economy, and as a result, the Dow did poorly. The index would continue to withstand turmoil during the next couple of decades, and with the turn of the millennium, it would lag the losses of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 during the time when the devastating September 11 attacks shook markets.Story continuesThe index's history has also seen several companies come and go. The longest running component of the Dow index is believed to be General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric is one of the oldest companies in America, and it was part of the original Dow index of 1896. Keeping its place in the list of elite stocks for 122 years, the firm exited the Dow in 2018. True to its name the ""Dow Jones 'Industrial' Average,"" most of the original constituents of the Dow were industrial companies. However, its reshaping has been influenced by trends in the broader U.S. economy, with the latest additions being some of the most consequential firms of today such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The chairman and managing director of the Dow Indices index's committee Mr. David Blitzer was cognizant of the evolutionary dynamics in the stock market at the time of GE's de-listing, as he commented:Since then [1907] the U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.Right now, five out of the 30 stocks in the Dow index are information technology firms, making it the largest sector in the index. After tech, the largest sector in the index is financial services, and together, the pair represent nine out of the 30 companies in the Dow. Currently, the oldest member of the index is The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which was added in 1932 and the three youngest additions are Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). According to S&amp;P Dow Jones, the change was prompted after Apple split its shares four to one, which ended up affecting the index's weights.Taking stock of the Dow's performance this year, the index has gained a modest 2.91%, which reflects the mixed performance in the U.S. economy. While technology stocks have soared, other areas such as regional banking and real estate haven't fared so well.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)The company will not undertake any research and development of drugs, Shah said.But CVS said the strategy is more than just slapping a label on a finished product.""For products that Cordavis co-manufactures, Cordavis will be significantly participating in the manufacturing process with contracted manufacturers, including things like overseeing manufacturing and quality control processes, developing product labeling, and organizing logistics for the products, among other things,"" a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.The 'most value for customers'""We have a strategy to go after the products where we believe we can create the most value for customers, and for the US marketplace where we can increase the competition, lower the cost, and get that cost to consumers, and get these products to consumers at lower prices,"" Shah said.The first product Cordvais will co-manufacture and commercialize is Sandoz's (NVS) Hyrimoz — a biosimilar to AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, which went off patent this year.The Cordavis-branded Hyrimoz will list for 80% less than Humira's price.That's similar to the prices rival OptumRx, a unit of UnitedHealth (UNH), announced last year.JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a note Wednesday that the move is a volume-based transaction with only upside for CVS.Story continues""CVS has committed to purchasing a certain amount of volume from Sandoz and management noted there are no additional capital commitments. CVS anticipates Cordavis will generate positive margins for commercializing the product, but it is too early to size the potential contribution,"" Gill said.OptumRx said its Sandoz-branded biosimilar Hyrimoz would list for 5% less than Humira, and the unbranded for 81% less than Humira, which has a list price of $6,922 per month for the injectable drug.By comparison, Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar Amjevita lists for 55% less than Humira for the unbranded version and 5% less for the branded version.Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs is dispensing Coherus' Yusimry, another biosimilar for Humira, for about $570, plus fees, per month.Specialty drugs in demandCordavis launched as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS, and is targeting the costly specialty drug market — which accounted for 50% of drug spend in the US in 2021 despite being used by only 2% of the population.Humira and its biosimilars fall into that category.The drug industry has focused more of its efforts in recent years to target specialty drug launches. Those efforts, paired with a number of patent cliffs for blockbuster drugs held by big pharma companies, is providing a market ripe for competition.""Over the next 10 years, we're seeing this biosimllar competition come into the US marketplace, and we want to ensure adoption of these products,"" Shah said.But it's also an area facing historic shortages as supply chain issues hamper product output.Cancer drugs as well as diabetes drugs, like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, have made it to the FDA's drug shortage list this year. That's why Shah said CVS intends to select products that can provide adequate supply.""When we're converting patients to these clinically complex equivalent [products] ... we want to make sure we don't run out of supply, and there [have] been supply issues with certain other products,"" Shah said, which outlines why the company chose Sandoz's biosimilar for its launch.“Cordavis is a logical evolution for us and will help ensure sufficient supply of biosimilars in the US and support this market now and in the future, while ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing costs for consumers,"" CVS CFO Shawn Guertin said Wednesday.""Let's be really clear. Our job is to drive the prices down as low as possible for our clients. That's what we do as a company every single day.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

While Nordstrom's credit card revenues rose 10% in the first half of this year, company executives said Tuesday that delinquencies are now above pre-pandemic levels and could ""result in higher credit losses in the second half and into 2024.""In an earnings call on Wednesday, Kohl's said ""other revenue,"" which is primarily its credit business, declined 3% in the second quarter, sharply down from 11% in the first quarter. The company also announced a new co-branded credit card with Capital One in a bid to attract more customers to its credit segment.U.S. department stores have long offered store credit cards, which often provide savings or points on purchases, as a way to capture sales and grow revenue. However, those cards are typically riskier than traditional credit cards, with higher interest rates and lower credit limits, according to credit reporting consultant John Ulzheimer.Macy’s credit card, for example, has an annual percentage of 31.99% while the national average is 22.39%, according to an August report by WalletHub. Those high interest rates, combined with laxer credit score thresholds, make it more likely that higher-risk consumers will sign up for store cards, according to Ulzheimer.While consumer spending remains relatively resilient according to U.S. retail sales data, investors and experts say rising delinquincies could signal growing pressure on some consumers. The percentage of delinquent payers rose by 23.1% to 38.2% between the second quarters of 2022 and 2023, with the biggest change among consumers in their 40s and 50s, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Story continuesDeclining payment rates could be ""an early sign that consumption is getting weaker,"" said FRED economist and vice president Juan M. Sánchez. Delinquency rates are currently highest among young consumers in their 20s and 30s and those in more economically distressed zip codes.Defaults in credit payments mean department stores are now assuming higher bad debt and write-offs for the year as spending remains pressured in the United States.""For stressed consumers, store cards are one of the first things they may be late or renege on before regular credit cards, car payments, and mortgages which they consider more important,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh and Granth Vanaik in Bengaluru; Kate Masters in New York; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

Now there is a new concern: credit card delinquencies.Overall credit card debt topped $1 trillion as of the end of the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Credit card delinquencies climbed to 7.2%, reaching 2019 levels. Auto loans rose to 7.3%, also reaching pre-pandemic levels.Read more: How to consolidate credit card debt with a personal loanNew warnings about consumers came this week from several retailers who said customers were already having trouble paying off their credit card debt.Macy’s (M) reported card sales dropped 36% from the prior year with the retailer’s CFO warning of ""higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs."" Footlocker (FL) fell 28% Wednesday after the retailer suspended its dividend, citing a need to compete for ""price-sensitive consumers.""The return of student loan repayments in October could also make financial matters worse for some consumers, forcing them to pull back on their spending in other areas such as credit card repayments.Loan losses from credit cards and auto loans are ""the big issue that certain banks have to worry about"" now instead of commercial real estate, Dick Bove, a bank analyst for Odeon Capital, told Yahoo Finance.Because of these concerns Bove downgraded Capital One (COF), which relies heavily on credit card income, to a Sell rating earlier this year. He did the same to online bank Ally Financial (ALLY), which has a lot of auto loans.“I think we’re going to see a wave of loan losses for both these companies in these areas,” he said.To be sure, credit card loans make up only a small portion of the total loans and leases and total assets held by US commercial banks. As of the week ending Aug. 9, according to the Federal Reserve, credit card loans accounted for 8.2% of all loans and 4.4% of all assets, respectively.Story continuesAnd even though credit card delinquencies at banks have been steadily rising since the second half of 2021, delinquencies had previously fallen during the pandemic to their lowest rate since 1991, according to Fed data.“We're coming off really low delinquencies prior to this. So you're going to see a natural uptick,” Smead Capital Management CEO Cole Smead told Yahoo Finance.Alexander Yokum, a bank analyst for CFRA, said he is ""not that concerned"" about how rising card balances and delinquencies could impact the lenders he follows ""with unemployment under 4%.""""The consumer is still in pretty good shape,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income told Yahoo Finance, noting that underneath the surface consumers on the ""lower end"" may be facing the brunt of current financial difficulties.To be sure, there is little doubt banks are bracing for losses to increase. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) increased the provisions they set aside for possible future loan losses by 17% between the first and second quarters.For the first half of the year, they have accumulated $13.3 billion, a 42% increase compared to the first half of 2022.Some banks are also pulling back on this type of lending. Consumer loan growth at US commercial banks in July was 5.9%, a decline from a 7.3% rate in June and 10.8% at the start of the year.For credit card and other revolving consumer plans, growth has cooled to half of its pace from a year ago.""The trend is very negative,"" Yokum said of the rising delinquencies in credit cards. ""If elevated, interest rates end up pushing the economy into recession. That's a much bigger issue, but that the case of a recession has been receding, not really increasing over the last few quarters,"" he added.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents, indicating a year-over-year decrease of 4.2%.HPE expects third-quarter revenues between $6.7 billion and $7.2 billion. The consensus mark for quarterly revenues is pegged at $6.98 billion, suggesting an increase of 0.4% from the year-ago period.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while matching the same on two occasions, the average beat being 8%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS SurpriseHewlett Packard Enterprise Company price-eps-surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteFactors to NoteHPE’s fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong momentum in the as-a-service platform and significant contributions from growth businesses, such as high-performance computing &amp; modular cooling systems and Intelligent Edge. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the total as-a-service order value crossed the $10 billion mark, while the company shifted its business to a high-margin software-intensive as-a-service offering.Our estimate for the company’s High-Performance Computing &amp; Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Edge segment third-quarter revenues is pegged at $851.6 million and $1.32 billion, respectively.Accelerated digital transformation and the higher demand for cloud networking due to the continuous hybrid working trend are likely to have contributed to the third-quarter top line. The solid adoption of the Aruba Edge Services Platform, which provides edge-to-cloud connectivity as a service, and its cloud services arm, HPE GreenLake, might have driven the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.Story continuesOur estimate for HPE’s Compute and Storage segment third-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.70 billion and $1.07 billion, respectively.Hewlett Packard’s gross margin is likely to have improved during the quarter, driven by a strong pricing discipline that is likely to have mitigated logistic costs, the benefits of an improving supply-chain base, a positive mix shift to high-margin software-rich businesses, cost takeouts and automation.However, HPE expects to continue facing higher commodity costs and foreign-exchange headwinds for the next few quarters. These factors are likely to have negatively impacted its sales growth and profitability in the quarter under review.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hewlett Packard this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

These figures lead us to an intriguing question: Is Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) significantly undervalued? To answer this, we delve into a comprehensive valuation analysis of the company. We invite you to explore this analysis with us.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PLAG. Click here to check it out. TSN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of TSNTyson Foods is a protein-centric food producer, selling raw chicken, beef, pork, and prepared foods. Chicken and beef are its two largest segments, each constituting about one-third of U.S. sales. Prepared foods make up roughly 20% of sales and include brands like Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, and Sara Lee. However, most of these are in product categories teeming with competition where Tyson does not have a massive market share lead. Tyson sells some products overseas, but the international segment accounts for just 5% of total revenue. The company is an active acquirer, with more recent years' purchases focused on international and food-service markets.Is Tyson Foods (TSN) Significantly Undervalued?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. It is calculated based on three factors:1. Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.2. GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.3. Future estimates of the business performance.The stock of Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is believed to be significantly undervalued according to GuruFocus' valuation method. GF Value estimates the stock's fair value based on three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns. At its current price of $54.18 per share, Tyson Foods stock is believed to be significantly undervalued.Story continuesGiven that Tyson Foods is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Is Tyson Foods (TSN) Significantly Undervalued?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, investors must carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Tyson Foods has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.08, which ranks worse than 81.69% of 1759 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Tyson Foods's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Is Tyson Foods (TSN) Significantly Undervalued?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Tyson Foods has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $53.30 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.92. Its operating margin is 2.41%, which ranks worse than 63.48% of 1818 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Overall, the profitability of Tyson Foods is ranked 8 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Tyson Foods is 8.2%, which ranks better than 56.01% of 1714 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 13.6%, which ranks better than 62.77% of 1523 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Tyson Foods's return on invested capital is 2.42, and its cost of capital is 6.67.Is Tyson Foods (TSN) Significantly Undervalued?ConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Tyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is believed to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 62.77% of 1523 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.

Mastercard, when asked to confirm exactly which nations in the Middle East would be affected, said in a later email there were “only four pilot programs in market” without specifying whether one of those was just Bahrain or the entire Gulf Cooperation Council.A Binance spokesperson responded to a request for comment with the same statement from the initial X/Twitter post, while a spokesperson for Mastercard said in an email to Fortune that waiting to end the partnership until late September “provides cardholders with a wind-down period to convert any holdings in their Binance wallet.” (A Binance spokesperson separately told Bloomberg that Visa, which had a similar partnership, stopped issuing co-branded cards in Europe last month.)Story continuesIn a May interview, when asked whether Mastercard was reconsidering its relationships with Binance and other crypto companies in the crosshairs of U.S. regulators, Raj Dhamodharan, a Mastercard executive vice president and the firm’s head of crypto and blockchain, did not respond directly to the question. “[The] safety and security of our network and consumer experiences are the number one priority for us,” he told Fortune.The winding down of Mastercard’s relationship with Binance comes amid an increasingly fraught legal and public relations crisis for the world’s largest crypto exchange.In March, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, over the exchange’s allegedly deliberate efforts to direct American crypto traders away from Binance’s American subsidiary to its more profitable international exchange, among other allegations.In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission upped the legal ante when it sued Binance and Zhao, filing even more explosive allegations, including claims that the crypto exchange and its CEO flouted U.S. money laundering laws.And now, Binance and Zhao are facing a potential criminal indictment from the Justice Department, which has prompted a suite of executives to quit over Zhao’s response to the government’s investigation.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

106,9851c742-ea29-36b7-a901-63dc87cd3c9a,QCOM,2023-08-25,Here's What We Like About QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-qualcomms-nasdaq-qcom-upcoming-100433364.html,1692957873,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Readers hoping to buy QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase QUALCOMM's shares before the 30th of August in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of September.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.80 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.20 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, QUALCOMM stock has a trailing yield of around 2.9% on the current share price of $108.51. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately QUALCOMM's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether QUALCOMM generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 50% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see QUALCOMM's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 36% per annum for the past five years. QUALCOMM is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, QUALCOMM has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.The Bottom LineShould investors buy QUALCOMM for the upcoming dividend? QUALCOMM has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention.Wondering what the future holds for QUALCOMM?

107,5e2c2476-837c-3731-bbe3-28d60995527a,QCOM,2023-08-25,Nvidia outlook: Is chipmaker cornering the market?,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-outlook-chipmaker-cornering-market-202540991.html,1692908740,VIDEO,"['QCOM', 'AMD', 'NVDA']","[Nvidia's Q2 earnings surpassed expectations. Is Nvidia (NVDA) beginning to corner the chip market? Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to discuss Nvidia's revenue, company outlook, supply and demand, and how the chipmaker is able to hold off competitors in the market.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, NVIDIA's second quarter earnings surpassed. Analysts already lofty expectations for the tech giant. But while Wall Street is hoping other chipmakers jump deeper into AI, question is NVIDIA cornering the market.Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joining us with more. Dan, it's worth noting this stat again, 90% of the GPU market specifically on AI. NVIDIA already has it.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, it's going to be tough for companies to overcome this. It's beyond a first-mover advantage, when it comes to AI and NVIDIA at this point. They're just dominating the market in a way that we haven't seen in a long time. I mean, you can think of Apple in the smartphone space, even they don't have the market share that NVIDIA has right now.And it really goes back to the investments that they made years ago. They were originally a gaming company. And then they opened up to developers and said, go nuts with what you can. And that led to the investments that they have now in AI.And I remember years and years ago when they were going on about AI at a conference they were doing, I just kept thinking, man, just get to the gaming stuff. I want to hear about that. And lo and behold, this is absolutely paying off in the biggest way possible.I mean, you can look at Intel and AMD not having the best time of it. Intel especially. They've just been struggling mightily as they try to turn that ship around, build out their foundry business, working with other companies along the way. AMD, it is a competitor in the space, but it just can't touch what NVIDIA is doing.And I think part of that is because AMD is split between the two worlds. They do CPUs and GPUs. And, yeah, you would think that that's good for them, because it allows them to play in both spaces. But it also means that their attention is divided whereas NVIDIA is all about GPUs, and they're putting all of their effort into that.Story continuesThe other big thing about NVIDIA is that they work the software behind the hardware. So they're full stack, soup to nuts. So that's how they have that advantage there. And part of the reason why Intel, AMD-- we talk about Qualcomm, we talk about Arm as much as those companies are talking about getting into AI as well. But it's the reason why they're able to hold off competitors at this point.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Dan, certainly a massive first-mover advantage, at least for now when we talk about the fact that they account for nearly all of that market share and the demand simply that is there. There are, though, some risks here for NVIDIA potentially down the road. We've talked a little bit about supply. But what does that look like and what else should investors keep in mind?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, so that was something that came up on the earnings call with supply and China. The two things that people were really worried about was can NVIDIA keep up with supply with TSMC and its other suppliers? Can they meet customer demand which is just through the roof? And can they meet the expectations that they'll continue to provide products if there is an issue with China, if we see further sanctions against exporting from the US to China?And basically what the company's CFO had said was there's no problem. Our suppliers are working well with us. They're ramping up. They're ramping up through this year and into the next. And they're also not going to experience any issues if there are additional sanctions against exporting to China.So right now, they're sitting pretty. I mean, you can't look at them and say there's no problems. I'm sure that eventually supply will be an issue. But at this point, they're saying, look, up to 2024, we're pretty damn set.SEANA SMITH: All right, and again, stock up 200%-- over 220% since the start of the year. Dan, thanks.]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then check out 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks in 2023. August 2023 is a crucial month as the stock market pours over the countless earnings reports for the second calendar quarter. The first half of the year saw mega technology cap stocks soar to record high levels, fueled by heightened optimism and expectations about artificial intelligence. At the same time, the fresh earnings report allowed investors and analysts to gauge the impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes on corporate operations, and the dropping inflation's effects on revenues and consumer spending power.The first two technology giants to report earnings this season were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both, like some of their other peers, are at the top of the recent AI wave. Meta, which owns Facebook, is expected to significantly benefit from artificial intelligence when it comes to providing users with advertisements and content recommendations based on their previous Facebook use and preferences in general. Facebook also announced a new artificial intelligence model in August through which it aims to enable users who speak different languages to communicate with each other.On the earnings front, Meta reported $2.98 in adjusted earnings per share which marked a 16% annual growth. Revenue for the firm stood at $31.9 billion after growing by 11% annually. The earnings report also provided details about Meta's costly bet on the metaverse which not only saw the firm plow billions of dollars into the technology last year but also change its name to reflect the change. This bet came at the wrong time as far as the stock market was concerned, as investors were looking for cost cutting at a time of high interest rates and high inflation. This led to Meta's shares being one of the worst performing stocks in 2022, but the shares have roared back to life this year as they are up by 136% year to date.Story continuesMicrosoft, which is another firm at the heart of the AI wave, grew its revenue by 8% annually as it reported $56.2 billion in net sales. However, the firm's guidance for the current quarter failed to impress investors and its shares slipped on the stock market as a result. Alphabet's results were far more impressive than Microsoft's as the firm beat analyst revenue estimates and posted $74.6 billion in revenue to mark a 7% annual growth.Finally, the remaining two tech titans, namely Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed a mixed bag of results that reflected the current economic turmoil and uncertainty. Starting off with Apple, the largest technology company in the world relied on its services segment to beat top and bottom line analyst estimates. However, Apple, which relies on high end, premium products to earn its keep, saw its revenue drop by 1% annually with its hardware segment leading the drop as consumers felt a pinch to their purchasing power. Amazon, on the other hand, roared on the same day that Apple sounded a bit meek, as it beat analyst estimates for both revenue and net income and also surpassed the guidance estimates for the current quarter.As to why Amazon managed to thrive in a tough consumer economy, here's what the firm's management had to say during the earnings call for the quarter:Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores’ fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn’t matter much to customers.This argument is incorrect. There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It’s also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There’s a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms.So which are the most profitable technology companies in 2023? The top three are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc.

Qualcomm is regularly named on many ""best places to work"" lists. In 2022, these awards included Forbes' America's Best Employers for Women and Best Employers for New Grads, Top 50 Employers for STEM Workforce Diversity Magazine, Disability: IN's Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion, Glassdoor's Best Place to Work, America's Best Large Employers and Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.Every employee at our Company is responsible for supporting an inclusive, respectful and harassment-free, discrimination-free and retaliation-free work environment. We have a variety of initiatives and trainings to uphold these values as well as workplace DEI:All U.S.-based employees are required to complete harassment prevention training at their time of hire and every two years thereafter. While harassment prevention training is a legal obligation, we have elected to create a live training session that goes above and beyond the minimum legal requirements and includes sections on the importance of civility and empathy in the workplace, subtle acts of exclusion and the impacts that they can have on minority groups.We also conduct mandatory training for new hires on DEI as part of the employee onboarding process and provide company-wide access to a library of online and in-person trainings on interpersonal topics, such as soliciting feedback, articulating your value, reducing team burnout, becoming an ally at work, building a diverse professional network and more.We continue to empower managers by providing training on topics such as unconscious bias and creating inclusive teams to help positively influence decision-making and people management. These concepts, which are woven into the foundation of our processes - including those related to promotion and annual reviews - support inclusive and equitable treatment amongst employees at all levels.We offer dynamic leadership development programs such as the Leadhership1® Program, BetterUp Coaching, Women Unlimited, Inc., Qualcomm's SMART Mentorship and Qualcomm's Mentoring Matters. These programs provide effective coaching and mentoring and, for optimal personal development, are often tailored specifically for the employee's job level and reporting organization. They are highly sought after by employees who wish to participate in regular sessions, cohort group meetings and/or networking opportunities. Through participation in these programs, our employees can increase self-awareness and career ownership, and access tools to achieve their personal goals.Story continuesCollaborations with External OrganizationsOur collaboration with organizations that champion diversity, equity and inclusion are vital to our success in providing additional resources, support and capacity-building to our employees. Highlights in 2022 include:We continued to work with the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) as an investment-level collaborator to promote opportunities for gender diversity in technology and computing. As part of this, we continued to participate in Technolochicas, a national initiative of NCWIT, and we announced our very own Technolochica. Technolochicas uses the powerful stories of Latinas from diverse backgrounds in technology fields to raise awareness among young Latinas and their families about opportunities and careers in technology. Our Technolochica will contribute to the initiative by helping to promote our Company's commitment to hiring diverse candidates and will also serve as a role model for future generations of Latina technologists.We celebrated our fourth year of membership with Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, including our continued support for Reboot's mission to close the gender gap for underrepresented women of color in tech. Reboot and its coalition company members seek to design solutions to include the most underrepresented communities to increase Black, LatinX and Native American women's participation in technology and STEM. These solutions involve developing a pipeline from K-12 schools to colleges and graduate institutions, and to develop skills to prepare these young women for professions in tech. We also participated in Reboot's inaugural mentorship program, which aimed to introduce Black, Latina and Native American women undergraduates in computing to role models who look like them.We continued to be an Inclusion Works Partner with Disability:IN, the leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide. Our collaboration includes participating in speaking engagements for global audiences and implementing recommended best practices across our workplace. In 2022, our CEO signed Disability:IN's CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion, to continue advancing equality and inclusion and to serve as a positive example for disability inclusion for CEOs and organizations globally. We were also recognized as a Disability Equality Index® Top Scorer and Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the eighth consecutive year.We held the Racial Justice Giving Initiative (RJGI) as part of our ongoing effort to collaborate with our employees to support racial justice in the United States. Through the RJGI, employees nominate nonprofit organizations that are working to drive systemic change in racial justice and equity. The RJGI Committee then evaluates the nominations based on pre-determined criteria and selects organizations to participate.

Big Tech, like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft; so are all the banks and financial institutions that invested directly; and companies using AI, like IBM and Salesforce,"" Anat Alon-Beck, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, told Yahoo Finance.Some of the big names that experts say are primed to win with Nvidia include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), and IBM (IBM).Amazon and Microsoft are especially key as they have existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. All three companies got shoutouts towards the top of Nvidia's Wednesday earnings call.Two under-the-radar winners who also emerged in Nvidia's earnings call: Snowflake (SNOW) and VMware (VMW), both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships.A notable post-Nvidia spike was Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL): Shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report amid the company's stock hitting a high unseen since April 2022 earlier in the day. Nvidia and Google Cloud announced a partnership emphasizing AI hardware in March.Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, speaks during a press conference at Computex 2023 in Taipei on May 30, 2023. (Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)Ultimately, there's no bigger winner out of Nvidia earnings than Nvidia itself — and the AI boom that's propelled the chipmaker to new heights. Though the AI hype can't last forever, with this latest earnings report, Nvidia and the hype have shown some key resilience.Story continuesThe losers and the question marksNvidia's competitors are clearly in the crosshairs: Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) all saw their shares in the red on Thursday. AMD's seeing the steepest decline, falling as much as 8%.However, it's not curtains for non-Nvidia chipmakers, either — this is a big market and it's still early days, said Alon-Beck.""I know that they definitely compete with each other, but that Nvidia seems to be the one that won Wall Street’s affection,"" Alon-Beck said. ""They are all important, especially with what’s happening in the international arena and the tensions with China. All of them — Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm — are in talks with US officials about the China market. I don’t have a crystal ball but would think that perhaps it’s good for all of them if Nvidia continues to succeed. Yes, competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses, but there is room for all in our current market.""Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, and that could have ramifications down the line. It all looks good mid-hype cycle, but companies are going to have to work to meet the demand for AI by revamping their existing systems over time. Specifically, data centers — at the center of operations for essentially all tech companies — are in flux as the demand for Nvidia chips is re-forming how data centers will operate and grow from here.""A company may have an allocation of [AI chips], but the next critical question is whether they have the data center capacity to make it usable,"" Tom Traugott, SVP of strategy at EdgeCore Digital Infrastructure, told Yahoo Finance.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Video TranscriptROCHELLE AKUFFO: Well, Nvidia did it again last night, delivering results that showed explosive demand for artificial intelligence computing. The company's success sent shares of other chip makers, tech giants, and AI related companies higher. But do rising tides really lift all boats? Well, our very own Allie Garfinkle is here with the winners and losers from these Nvidia results. Hey Allie.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Hi, Rochelle. Nvidia earnings have really become this earthquake, changing their environment and really shaking loose some clear winners and losers. Now what do I mean by winners and losers? What I mean is, it's clear who's aligned with the NVIDIA train and who's not. On the winner side, it was pretty easy to identify them. They got shout outs at the top of the earnings call. Think Amazon, Microsoft. They have these pre-existing Cloud partnerships with NVIDIA that are increasingly valuable.Think about also Meta. Meta got a shout out for saying, hey, they're helping drive consumer demand, and they have a pre-existing partnership with NVIDIA. There are also two under the radar names that really came in as winners here. VMware and Snowflake both have new enterprise partnerships with NVIDIA and did see shares follow those commensurate gains that we saw from some of the bigger names in the space, like Google, Amazon, Microsoft.Now the losers. I prefer to think of them as question marks because this is a long game here. However, it's pretty clear that Nvidia's competitors are in the crosshairs here. You have Qualcomm and Intel. They saw slight declines in after hours today. And AMD is down today 6% as of what the numbers that are right in front of me. Now experts are telling me that there is room for everyone in this market, but right now. There's no question about it, Nvidia is the name in chips right now and they are the one to beat.Story continuesROCHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly. As we're looking at the semiconductor stocks, they're really the only one in the green at the moment, everyone else under some pressure. But then once that crown is on your head then, how long can Nvidia keep crushing it?ALLIE GARFINKLE: Well it's-- what's the saying? It's, the head with the crown sleeps very badly, something like that. But it's the sort of thing. It's true, right? How long can this really last? And that's something I think a lot about. I'm a durational thinker. I'm the kind of person who's like, well, they're successful today, but will they be tomorrow?Even though we can't predict the future, I think there are two things we definitely know right now, Rochelle. Number one, this is really a distinct moment in time. This is unequivocally a historic year for NVIDIA. They're forecasting sales growth of 170% year over year in this current quarter. That is an unfathomable level of growth.The other thing too to consider, number two, things in tech change really quickly. Take the BlackBerry, iPhone example. I know you haven't thought about BlackBerry in a minute, but this is going to astonish you. In 2009, BlackBerry held 20% of the smartphone market share globally. By 2016, that number was less than 1%.A lot can change in tech really fast. But the other thing to consider is that, Nvidia's earnings for now are not just about Nvidia. They are this bona fide AI bellwether, and where they go is going to tell us a lot about where this hype cycle is trending.ROCHELLE AKUFFO: And you raise a good point, especially as you talked about some of the pre-existing partnerships, whereas with BlackBerry, they were kind of-- they weren't in the same boat. But it'll be interesting to see what happens first out of the gate. As you mentioned there, heavy is the head that wears the crown.ALLIE GARFINKLE: It's a long road. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Yes--ROCHELLE AKUFFO: It certainly is.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Thank you, Rochelle.]"

But how sustainable is the stock's growth? Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick and Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss.On Nvidia’s earnings call, the company explained how the technology is being used and the partnerships it has with other companies. Howley explains, “there are means to an end here, where real products come of this” and these products, “will benefit consumers, as well as regular workers.”In the 1990s, tech companies Qualcomm (QCOM) and Cisco (CSCO), saw their stocks rise, but “the market got way ahead of itself,” Sosnick says, and the stocks ultimately dropped. For Nvidia, “there are other headwinds in terms of valuation that we have to consider. And the question is, will this deliver and will this deliver to bottom lines, not just be a great technology?” Sosnick explains.Video Transcript- And what I was struck by on the call-- I mean, in addition to-- you and I have spoken to Jensen Huang before, and he is very good at sort of spinning a grand narrative and has delivered on that narrative, at least in some measure. But I was also struck that the company gave specific examples of its partnerships and how the tech is being used sort of concretely, which I thought was interesting.So talk to us. Like, how big a deal is this to sort of answer some of the stuff that Steve was talking about?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think for a lot of companies, the hyperscalers kind of are looking at this as almost a kind of, if not an extension of cloud computing, then a new iteration on cloud computing. Now obviously it's two different types of technologies, right? But when you look at the way it's being spoken about from NVIDIA's side of things, from Microsoft's side of things, from Google's side of things, Meta, Amazon, it seems as though this is a kind of a new generation.Story continuesAnd so what Microsoft's-- you know, just going back to their earnings, tried to lay out--- And when we talk about hyperscalers, we're talking about--DAN HOWLEY: Big cloud companies.- Like a Microsoft.DAN HOWLEY: Right. Meta outside of that. But still in the generative AI side of things. But when we go back to Microsoft's earnings and Google's earnings, what they did was they tried to encapsulate what generative AI is doing for them. How they're using it, what customers are starting to get into it. And so Microsoft wanted to make sure that people knew that it's starting to pay off for them.Didn't get too specific in numbers, but we saw that when they priced their-- I believe it was Microsoft 365 Copilot, shares just blew up. It was $30 per person per month. So Google tried to do the same thing. So we're seeing these companies now come out and explain, you know, it's not just my kid's going to type this in and maybe, you know, cheat on his exam or whatever.But there are means to an end here where real products come of this. And it will benefit consumers, as well as regular workers. But I think that's something that, you're right, that Jensen was really, really particular about ensuring that shareholders knew that, in their mind, that it's not a fad. Now, you know, there have been faddish things that Nvidia's not necessarily pointed to before but fallen, let's say, victim to the whole, you know, crypto craze obviously. They were really stung by that.The metaverse and, you know, the VR, AR, they're still working with that. But you know, it was kind of spoken of as this next big trend. But it seems as though AI is going to be, as Steve said, it's not new. It's the type of AI. This is not like, you know-- I mean, we've talked about this before. Siri is AI, guys. I know it's not great, but it's AI. I don't know what to tell you.But this is a new version of AI. And I think, you know, how that eventually is worked out is what Nvidia is trying to put forward, as well as the likes of Microsoft and Google.- Steve, we had ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott tell us that this is like an iPhone moment for enterprise software.- Yeah, Jensen has said that, too.- Exactly. And ServiceNow, one of the companies that got called out on the call last night, too, and some of the partnerships with Nvidia, when you see this many mega-cap tech companies having a massive partnership for a transformational technology as generative AI, does that tell us for the equity markets that these valuations, even if they might seem lofty right now, are actually substantive and warranted at the same time?STEVE SOSNICK: I guess that really depends on how you think this proceeds. You know, the positive example is, I couldn't-- you know, I thought Nvidia investors had said had set such a high bar for themselves that it was impossible to leap over. And yet they did and cleared it by a wide margin.On the other hand, you know, those of us who were around during the, you know, the '90s, the internet and, you know, Cisco being the backbone of the internet and Qualcomm being the power of cell phones, those two technologies were as transformative as everyone thought.- And by the way, we have a chart overlaying them because you brought this up. So this is Nvidia in 2023 versus Qualcomm and Cisco in 1999. Qualcomm was up something like 600% that year or something. Cisco was a lot less. But nonetheless, it still saw a big increase.STEVE SOSNICK: And these were transformative technologies and these companies are still here today. But the market got way ahead of itself.- And then they-- stocks plunged in the next following couple years.STEVE SOSNICK: Exactly. So I'm not coming on TV and saying Nvidia is going to plunge, you know, similar to that tomorrow. But markets get ahead of themselves. Markets get enthusiastic, and there are other headwinds in terms of valuation that we have to consider. And the question is, will this deliver, and will this deliver to bottom lines, not just be a great technology?]"

Many travel stocks, previously bruised and battered, are now recovering early, making them look like undervalued gems. The travel demand isn’t packing its bags anytime soon, and investors are seizing the opportunity to pick up some undervalued stocks to buy for the long haul.Travel is a sector that ebbs and flows with global events, and arguably no event showcased this as glaringly the Covid-19 crisis. For two grueling years, the U.S. watched as some of the most iconic hotels shuttered their windows while majestic aircraft and the once-bustling cruise ships became silent observers across the globe. With that said, here are three of the top undervalued travel stocks to wager on now.TripAdvisor (TRIP)image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comTripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has long been synonymous with trip planning and candid reviews in the ever-evolving realm of global travel. Yet, like a ship navigating choppy waters, the firm grapples with narrowing margins and a brawl to maintain its dominance. The past decade witnessed its competitive edge in core markets, thanks to rising challengers and a dwindling pool of high-revenue opportunities. Moreover, with their specialized offerings, nimble online travel agents are seemingly sprinting ahead in the growth race.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, every cloud has its silver lining, and for TripAdvisor, it’s their latest financial reveal. The company’s second-quarter press release presented a mixed bag; while the non-GAAP earnings-per-share of 34 cents missed the mark by roughly two cents, the revenue figures painted a bright picture. Raking in $494 million, a commendable 18.5% year-over-year bump, it exceeded expectations by $20.5 million.Moreover, TRIP stock trades at just 1.3 times forward sales, 66% lower than the 5-year median. Additionally, its enterprise-to-sales ratio is at just 1.2, 35.4%, lower than the sector median and 72% lower than the 5-year median.Story continuesExpedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comSitting atop the pyramid of online travel agencies, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) has established its position as a veritable titan. Catering to a wide spectrum of services in the space, Expedia is the digital concierge for countless travelers globally. Moreover, the past year has seen the company pivot with finesse, rolling out strategic cost-saving measures, streamlining operations, and building on its brand equity. Even as the echoes of the pandemic slowly fade, Expedia has penned a travel recovery narrative, cutting down debts and optimizing its workforce.In their second-quarter financial disclosure, the numbers sparkled. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.89 handily surpassed expectations by 53 cents, and a revenue surge to $3.36 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year growth, is just the tip of the iceberg. The narrative is clear, with lodging gross bookings and revenue hitting record highs for any second quarter. And if that wasn’t enough, Tiprank’s recent analysis offers a cherry on top: projecting a potential 20% upside on EXPE stock, crowning it with a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating.American Airlines (AAL)American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flightsSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comNavigating through post-pandemic skies, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has effectively delivered a performance that’s difficult to overlook. As the travel bug bit harder this year, American Airlines second-quarter earnings soared, touching the clouds with an earnings-per-share of $1.92, significantly higher than the anticipated $1.59 by industry analysts. Regarding revenue, the company’s figures were equally impressive with $14.06 billion against Wall Street’s forecasted $13.74 billion. Adding to the upbeat rhythm, the flying capacity grew by a promising 5.3% in the same quarter.They’ve optimistically ramped up their forward guidance for 2023, banking on the travel euphoria to sail smoothly into next year. Their sterling second-quarter results mirror the positive winds blowing across the aviation sector. Industry whisperers predict U.S. airlines to be on track to ferry a whopping 257 million passengers in the sunny window between June 1 and August 31.

Shares have lost about 0.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is RTX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Raytheon Technologies Q2 Earnings Top, Sales View RaisedRaytheon Technologies’ second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.29 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 by 10.3%. The bottom line also improved 11% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.16.Including one-time items, the company reported GAAP earnings of 90 cents per share compared with 88 cents in the prior-year quarter.Operational PerformanceRaytheon Technologies’ second-quarter sales of $18,315 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17,543 million by 4.4%. The figure also rose 12.3% from $16,314 million recorded in the year-ago period.Total costs and expenses increased 12.7% year over year to $16,882 million. The company generated an operating profit of $1,458 million compared with $1,353 million in the prior-year quarter.Segmental PerformanceCollins Aerospace: Sales at this segment improved 17% year over year to $5,850 million. This improvement can be attributed to higher commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM sales, backed by strong demand across commercial aerospace end markets. Also, an increase in military sales buoyed by higher development volume boosted this segment’s top line.Its adjusted operating income totaled $837 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s level of $617 million.Pratt &amp; Whitney: This segment’s sales rose 15% year over year to $5,701 million. The improvement was due to growth in the commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM businesses, backed by higher shop visit volume and content, as well as higher engine deliveries and favorable mix across both Large Commercial Engines and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada units.Story continuesAdjusted operating profit amounted to $436 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s level of $303 million. This was driven by drop through on higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable large commercial OEM mix.Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space: This segment recorded second-quarter sales of $3,655 million, up 2% year over year, driven by higher sales from Sensing and Effects and Cyber and Services programs.Its adjusted operating profit totaled $297 million, down 6% from $315 million generated in the corresponding period of 2022.Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense: The unit recorded sales of $4,000 million, up 12% year over year. This was driven by higher sales volume from Air Power, Advanced Technology and Land Warfare &amp; Air Defense programs.The segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of $427 million, up 23% from that reported in the year-ago period.Financial UpdateRaytheon Technologies had cash and cash equivalents of $5,391 million as of Jun 30, 2023, compared with $6,220 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Long-term debt was $32,723 million as of Jun 30, 2023, up from $30,694 million as of Dec 31, 2022.Net cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $144 million as of Jun 30, 2023, against net cash inflow worth $1,762 million at the end of second-quarter 2022.Its free cash outflow was $1,190 million at the end of the reported quarter against free cash inflow of $844 million at the end of second-quarter 2022.GuidanceRaytheon Technologies has updated its financial guidance for 2023.The company still projects adjusted EPS in the band of $4.95-$5.05, up from the earlier projected range of $4.90-$5.05. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2023 EPS is pegged at $5.01, which lies above the midpoint of the company’s guided range.Raytheon Technologies also raised its revenues guidance to the band of $73-$74 billion, up from the previously projected $72-$73 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $72.20 billion, which lies below the mid-point of the company’s guidance.RTX now expects to generate free cash flow of $4.3 billion, down from the earlier projected $4.8 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -7.24% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, RTX has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C.

Shares have lost about 5.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PulteGroup due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PulteGroup Q2 Earnings Beat, Orders Up on Strong DemandPulteGroup Inc. reported impressive results in second-quarter 2023. Its earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimates and increased year over year. The upside was mainly driven by its solid operating model, which strategically aligns the production of build-to-order and quick-move-in homes with applicable demand across consumer groups.Backed by its disciplined and balanced business model, the company witnessed solid gross closings, orders and margins in the reported quarter and posted a 12-month return on equity of 32%.Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings per share came in at $3.00, topping the consensus mark of $2.47 by 21.5% and increasing by 9.9% from $2.73 reported a year ago.Total revenues of $4.19 billion also beat the consensus mark of $3.96 billion by 5.9% and increased 8% from the year-ago figure of $3.88 billion.Segment DiscussionPulteGroup primarily operates through two business segments — Homebuilding and Financial Services.Revenues from the Homebuilding segment were up 7.9% year over year to $4.1 billion. Home sale revenues of $4.06 billion increased nearly 8% year over year, mainly due to the higher closings and average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues also rose 11.2% from a year ago to $37.6 million.The number of homes closed increased 5% from the year-ago level to 7,518 units. The average selling price (ASP) of homes delivered was $540,000, up 3% year over year.Most importantly, its backlog, which represents orders yet to be closed, was 13,558 units, down 29.3% year over year. In addition, potential housing revenues from backlog decreased by 29.5% from the prior-year quarter to $8.2 billion.New home orders gained 23.8% year over year to 7,947 units for the quarter, benefiting from strong demand and an increased community count. The value of new orders also rose 9.4% from a year ago to $4.3 billion. The cancelation rate was 9% of the beginning backlog, down 350 basis points (bps) from the previous-year period.Home sales gross margin was down 170 bps year over year to 29.6% for the reported quarter. The metric was up 50 bps sequentially, backed by favorable demand and improved pricing on spec sales. SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved 50 bps to 7.8% from 9.3% a year ago.Revenues from the Financial Services segment increased 11.4% year over year to $92.2 million. Pretax income for the segment increased 16% to $46 million from a year ago.Story continuesFinancialsAt the end of the second quarter, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1.78 billion, up from $1.09 billion in 2022-end. Net debt-to-capital was 2.6% at second quarter-end, significantly down from 9.6% at 2022-end.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.45 billion in the first half of 2023 versus $102.3 million in the first half of 2022.In second-quarter 2023, the company repurchased 3.7 million common shares for $250 million at an average price of $68.31 per share.GuidancePHM projects to close 7000-7,400 homes in the third quarter and 29,500 homes this year. The delivery targets are mainly benefiting from improved home construction cycle times. The ASP on these closings is likely to be nearly $540,000. In the previous year, the company reported home closings of 7,047 for $545,000 ASP in the third quarter and 29,111 for $542,000 ASP in 2022.The company expects gross margin to be within 29-29.5% for both the third and fourth quarters of this year. Gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 were 30.3% and 29.4%, respectively. SG&amp;A expense is anticipated to be in the range of 9-9.5% of home sale revenues in the third quarter and 8-8.5% in the fourth quarter. SG&amp;A expense in the third and fourth quarters of the previous year were 9.2% and 7.1%, respectively.It expects the tax rate for the remainder of 2023 to be 24.5%.The company still expects community count to grow 5-10% in the third and fourth quarters.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted 32.5% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, PulteGroup has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise PulteGroup has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The filing due date for the briefs are Sept. 18 for the Merck lawsuit and Oct. 6 for PhRMA.There are additional lawsuits that have been filed over these negotiations, including by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) — which have been consolidated to a single court in New Jersey.AARP officials said they expect more lawsuits to be filed once the list of targeted drugs is published on Aug. 29, just days before the Sept. 1 deadline CMS had originally set.On a media call on Thursday, AARP officials argued the drug companies' goal is to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court.""They're trying to get as many cases filed as they can, across multiple [court] circuits, so that they all end up, or some of them end up, in front of the Supreme Court,"" said Kelly Bagby, vice president of litigation at the AARP Foundation.AARP logo displayed on a smartphone screen and in the background. (Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)Some Wall Street analysts have echoed the idea the goal for plaintiffs is to reach the Supreme Court, and said the move is unlikely to delay the negotiation process. Negotiated prices are set to go into effect for the 2026 plan year.The lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging they are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Story continuesLeigh Purvis, AARP Public Policy Institute's prescription drug policy principal, said that the negotiation process is ""not a hostage situation.""""Drug companies do have options. One is that they can withdraw their products from Medicare and Medicaid, and the other is they can allow generic competitors on the market. You do not have to participate in the negotiation process if you are not a single-source drug,"" Purvis said.Drug companies have threatened that negotiated prices will hamper innovation and that drug prices are not set based on the cost of production, but rather the ""value add,"" or the value of lifestyle improvement and avoidance of costly hospital visits gained.Purvis said that on the latter argument, companies don't have ""any evidence that what they are bringing to the table actually offers value.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)The company will not undertake any research and development of drugs, Shah said.But CVS said the strategy is more than just slapping a label on a finished product.""For products that Cordavis co-manufactures, Cordavis will be significantly participating in the manufacturing process with contracted manufacturers, including things like overseeing manufacturing and quality control processes, developing product labeling, and organizing logistics for the products, among other things,"" a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.The 'most value for customers'""We have a strategy to go after the products where we believe we can create the most value for customers, and for the US marketplace where we can increase the competition, lower the cost, and get that cost to consumers, and get these products to consumers at lower prices,"" Shah said.The first product Cordvais will co-manufacture and commercialize is Sandoz's (NVS) Hyrimoz — a biosimilar to AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, which went off patent this year.The Cordavis-branded Hyrimoz will list for 80% less than Humira's price.That's similar to the prices rival OptumRx, a unit of UnitedHealth (UNH), announced last year.JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a note Wednesday that the move is a volume-based transaction with only upside for CVS.Story continues""CVS has committed to purchasing a certain amount of volume from Sandoz and management noted there are no additional capital commitments. CVS anticipates Cordavis will generate positive margins for commercializing the product, but it is too early to size the potential contribution,"" Gill said.OptumRx said its Sandoz-branded biosimilar Hyrimoz would list for 5% less than Humira, and the unbranded for 81% less than Humira, which has a list price of $6,922 per month for the injectable drug.By comparison, Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar Amjevita lists for 55% less than Humira for the unbranded version and 5% less for the branded version.Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs is dispensing Coherus' Yusimry, another biosimilar for Humira, for about $570, plus fees, per month.Specialty drugs in demandCordavis launched as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS, and is targeting the costly specialty drug market — which accounted for 50% of drug spend in the US in 2021 despite being used by only 2% of the population.Humira and its biosimilars fall into that category.The drug industry has focused more of its efforts in recent years to target specialty drug launches. Those efforts, paired with a number of patent cliffs for blockbuster drugs held by big pharma companies, is providing a market ripe for competition.""Over the next 10 years, we're seeing this biosimllar competition come into the US marketplace, and we want to ensure adoption of these products,"" Shah said.But it's also an area facing historic shortages as supply chain issues hamper product output.Cancer drugs as well as diabetes drugs, like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, have made it to the FDA's drug shortage list this year. That's why Shah said CVS intends to select products that can provide adequate supply.""When we're converting patients to these clinically complex equivalent [products] ... we want to make sure we don't run out of supply, and there [have] been supply issues with certain other products,"" Shah said, which outlines why the company chose Sandoz's biosimilar for its launch.“Cordavis is a logical evolution for us and will help ensure sufficient supply of biosimilars in the US and support this market now and in the future, while ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing costs for consumers,"" CVS CFO Shawn Guertin said Wednesday.""Let's be really clear. Our job is to drive the prices down as low as possible for our clients.

The Nasdaq has lost more than 7.2% in the last three weeks, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 4.6%, its worst three-week decline since the Mar 10 week.Bond Yields SoarThe recent jump in bond yields is taking a toll on the stock market. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.366% on Aug 22, hitting its highest level since 2007 and up nearly 40 bps month to date.An increase in bond yields reduces the appeal of a stock's future earnings. This is because higher bond yields provide investors with the opportunity to get lucrative returns from investments that are considerably safer in comparison to stocks.The recent rise in bond yields came just after the release of minutes of the Fed’s July FOMC that revealed that central bank officials are maintaining a hawkish stance as they believe that more interest rate hikes would be required to ease inflationary pressures. Every time interest rates increase, bond prices fall, which increases their yield.Fed Open for More Rate HikesInflation has sharply declined and nearly halved from its 40-year-high of 9.1% in June 2022. However, the Fed is open to more interest rate hikes as inflation is still elevated and a lot higher than its 2% target.Meanwhile, investors’ sentiments were dented further after the S&amp;P Global Ratings on Aug 21 cut the credit ratings on five regional banks with high commercial real estate exposure. This comes after Fitch Ratings, earlier this month, downgraded the U.S. long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+.Also, credit rating agency Moody’s, earlier this month, downgraded several banks and kept six on review for potential downgrades.Story continuesWorries Over ChinaChina's economic worries are further hurting investor confidence. The decrease in China's exports and imports is primarily attributed to weakened demand for goods on a global scale.China is grappling with deflation and substantial debt, which have the potential to impact economies worldwide.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.

It is the first Medtronic SCS device to offer a closed-loop feature that senses each person's unique biological signals and adjusts stimulation moment to moment, as needed, to keep therapy in harmony with the motions of daily life. †Spinal cord stimulators deliver mild electrical impulses to the spinal cord, which can disrupt pain signals before they reach the brain. As patients go about their daily lives, certain movements may result in uncomfortable stimulation. This in turn may lead some patients to turn down their device's stimulation output, resulting in a suboptimal therapy experience. By contrast, Inceptiv is able to sense the body's neural response to stimulation 50 times per second, every second of every day. When neural response increases, such as when the patient coughs, sneezes, or bends, Inceptiv automatically decreases stimulation. As neural response decreases, stimulation returns to the pre-set optimal level. This is done seamlessly to provide consistent therapy while patients perform a full range of daily activities.""Today, fixed-output spinal cord stimulation does not account for patient movements, which can alter the distance between the spinal cord and implanted epidural leads,"" said Dirk Rasche, M.D., from the Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein in Lübeck, Germany. ""This can compromise the patient´s experience and therapeutic effectiveness. The Inceptiv closed-loop feature will allow for a more consistent and optimal delivery of therapy, and reduced need for manual programming adjustments by the patient. Together with the compatibility of multiple types of waveform options, inclusive of DTM™ SCS, and industry-leading MRI access, I believe this latest generation of rechargeable neurostimulator represents a significant leap forward in SCS therapy and a milestone of modern neuromodulation.""Story continuesThe Inceptiv device utilizes a closed-loop capability with ECAPs (Evoked Compound Action Potentials), resulting from decades of Medtronic research and development to unlock the ability to listen and respond to signals along the spinal cord. ECAPs are a direct measure of how much neural tissue is activated in the spinal cord in response to electrical stimuli, providing real-time information that enables the system to respond to patient movements. In a clinical study, 9 out of 10 patients preferred the optional closed-loop setting compared to fixed-output stimulation.1""Medtronic pioneered SCS for pain management more than 50 years ago, and we continue to deliver new innovations that personalize care and improve pain relief for patients,"" said Ash Sharan, M.D., chief medical officer, Neuromodulation, which is part of the Neuroscience Portfolio at Medtronic. ""This approval marks the beginning of a new era of pain relief, using sensing technology to listen to the unique biological signals of each patient.""The Inceptiv neurostimulator is the only SCS system in Europe offering both full-body 1.5T and 3T MRI access.‡ Most people with SCS will need an MRI within five years of receiving their device.2 Inceptiv is also the thinnest SCS device in the world at just 6mm, and it offers the proven benefits of Medtronic's proprietary DTM™ spinal cord stimulation. The system's battery can be recharged from empty to full in approximately one hour.The Inceptiv SCS system will be commercially available in the coming months in Europe but is not approved for sale or distribution in the United States.† Sensing signals may not be measurable in all cases.‡ Under certain conditions.

We will then provide a financial update before answering questions. Ron?Story continuesRon ZwanzigerThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter results call. In the United States, during Q2 we strategically positioned our North American business to take advantage of the upcoming respiratory season in the short-term, while also focusing on expanding our testing menu for both short-term and long-term growth. We have 3 key updates.First, we extended our testing program with CVS to encompass numerous pharmacies across the U.S., complementing our existing partnership with the CVS MinuteClinics, which has been in place since 2020. The expansion leverages our current installed instrument base, allowing for strong operating margin on testing volumes within these new pharmacy sites during the upcoming respiratory season.Second, our COVID flu combo tests have been submitted to the FDA emergency U.S. authorization as part of the NIH's Independent Test Assessment program ITAP having already launched successfully in over 25 countries globally. Obtaining the EUA for our tests should be valuable -- should be a valuable addition to our U.S. testing portfolio. We're actively engaged in discussions regarding their current status of our application.Third, as reported in a recent press release, we're excited to report our submission of our 510(k) application to the FDA for the clearance of our 5-minute COVID ultra product. The innovative ultra-test strip design enables higher sample volumes, enhancing detection levels and reaction times for more precise results. This marks a significant milestone for LumiraDx as we work to expand the markets for our SARS-COVID-2 Ultra Test. The receipt of 510(k) approval from the FDA could also pave the way for expanding our testing menu in the U.S. on the unified -- on our unified platform.In Europe, our focus remains on the acceptance and expansions of our non-COVID portfolio. Non-COVID platform test volumes excluding seasonal respiratory products increased 50% sequentially. 26% of our customer purchased more than 3 assays during the second quarter in '23 versus 17% in the first quarter of '23, highlighting the positive impact of our menu expansion.A specific example of our unique NT-proBNP test. Following the January '23 launch of our NT-proBNP (inaudible) was dedicated to showcasing its lab-comparable performance and user-friendliness to clinicians and key opinion leaders by offering the only Fingerstick NT-proBNP test at the point of care. We were able to gain access to key accounts for evaluation.Our efforts have been supported by peer-reviewed studies, including those from the University of Uppsala and the European Journal of Heart Failure, emphasizing the clinical and economic benefits of widespread NT-proBNP testing in primary care settings. The studies confirmed the excellent performance of our test. The benefits of room temperature storage, the utility of the same test strip and method for samples of whole venous blood, capillary blood and plasma and the short turnaround time of the test, 12 minutes. These published studies are a welcome addition to the body of evidence showcasing our laboratory comparable performance of our tests at the point of care setting.We remain committed to transforming health care by enabling early heart failure diagnosis in the community and plan to expand our approach globally. Further, with regard to NT-proBNP, our collaborative work with Medtronic continues to develop positively. A follow-up event was run in Manchester in July, which continues to show excellent results and a direct impact for individuals being immediately referred for further testing due to elevated results.As a result of our second successful events, we planned to support further events with Medtronic in 2023 and have spun this concept out into other mobile settings, one of which is a workplace benefit program being run in Ireland in the fall of '23 with expanded scope. It will not only be heart health check -- checks with our NT-proBNP test but would also support diabetes screening with our HbA1c test, which highlights our multi-menu approach. We plan to further expand on this model globally in an overall effort to broaden general access to such needed health checks in an overall effort to transform how health care is delivered within the community.Our CRP test has made significant strides, particularly in community-based settings like virtual wards in the U.K. Partnerships like NHS Frimley Health have demonstrated the test value in real-time decision-making for antibiotic treatment, resulting in improved patient safety, experiences and cost savings.The aim was to support real-time decision-making on the need for antibiotic treatment in frail, acutely unwell patients in an effort to avoid hospital admission if achievable and desirable rather than waiting several hours for lab results. This customer described our platform as small portable battery-operated, robust and simple to use with room temperature reagent storage, ideal for community and mobile testing. The clinical and operational benefits were studied across various patients and the results were very positive in 50% of patients tested the LumiraDx CRP test improved the safety of care and helped to avoid the need for escalation to hospital care at a cost-saving of up to GBP 3,914 per patient.If adopted more broadly, these benefits could lead to substantial savings for health care systems. We continue to deliver on our multiple assay menu platform offering. As an example, we recently started working with a leading operator of care homes in Austria. They were looking for a more efficient way to test their patients at the bedside instead of sending them to hospitals -- hospital immediately, saving money and reducing patient stress. We're initially starting to work with them in the Vienna region with 16 instruments.They're currently focused on CRP, D-Dimer and our broader respiratory portfolio and have indicated that in the future expand -- they may expand to our entire assay portfolio and may also expand geographically into additional regions throughout Austria where they have other customer locations. This is an excellent example of how easy it can be to transform community-based health care with the LumiraDx platform when one single port of instrument can have a major positive clinical impact in nearly any setting.Coming into this [CE] respiratory season, believe we're well-placed strategically to continue to grow the CRP business as a broader part of our respiratory portfolio as the only platform available today at the peer point of care setting with CRP as well as flu and COVID tests. We provide a turnkey solution for important clinical pathways that are aimed at curbing antimicrobial resistance by differentiating between viral and bacterial infections.For example, the U.K. Primary Care Respiratory Society recommends algorithms they have developed to rule out COVID-19 and flu, taking other symptoms into account and using the point of care CRP test if the prescriber feels antibiotics are necessary. LumiraDx has the only platform at the point of care setting that can fulfill the entire algorithm with just our one instrument, making both the patient and clinician experience more efficient and desirable to the alternatives which would require the multiple POC instruments or having to wait hours for laboratory results.On the commercial side, we have expanded our reach into increased sales impact by entering into distribution agreement with Axon Labs, a major player in the industry for Germany and Switzerland. This distributor has already placed an initial order of instruments and [ad vitam] tests and aims to start to roll out in these countries shortly. We also plan to appoint an additional distributor -- additional distributors in other regions to increase sales reach and local customer support.The benefits of our broader menu are also felt in Africa. In Africa, we've been working with key stakeholders to drive uptake of non-COVID testing non -- on our 5,000-plus instruments installed with the Gates Foundation during the pandemic. We've now started shipping our HbA1c test to various African countries as well as D-Dimer test to Zimbabwe. D-Dimer has historically been underutilized as a marker of blood clotting in Africa, but the new features of the LumiraDx platform enable access to this important test.These tests also show utility in high-risk TB and HIV population. This reflects the overall benefit of the platform for tests being deployed in African countries where they have traditionally not been tested in the community. We note that globally, traditional health care models are being impacted in hospital setting due to funding and staffing restrictions and as a result, innovations like our portable point-of-care instruments are needed to allow testing in the community.As we continue to innovate and expand our portfolio, LumiraDx remains dedicated to transforming health care delivery worldwide and contributing to such impactful change.Now Dorian will further discuss our financial performance in the first quarter. Dorian?Dorian LeBlancThanks, Ron. Quarterly revenues for Q2 were $21 million, $9.2 million, or 44% of total revenues were from non-COVID specific solutions marking our highest quarter for our non-COVID revenues. These revenues included $4.4 million from our LumiraDx Technologies and $4.8 million from our distribution business.Total adjusted gross margins for the quarter were a loss of $6.6 million. Adjusted gross margins exclude net depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and restructuring charges. The decline in gross margin from Q1 was largely due to the new placement of more than 1,500 instruments in the U.S., primarily with our retail partner, to build testing capacity for the upcoming respiratory season.The full cost of these instrument placements were taken as a charge within Q2. Similar to Q1, the fixed cost base of our prior manufacturing investments pressured our overall margins at our current revenues. We do anticipate our significant capacity and low variable costs will enable seasonal revenues from the upcoming respiratory season to have a strong contribution margin to our gross margin and to our operating cash flows.As we approach the upcoming respiratory season, we have seen customer preference shift to our multiplex solutions for flu and COVID over COVID-only testing. We have seen the majority of our Fast Lab's revenues migrate to our flu COVID offering. As a result, we did take further inventory reserves on raw materials related to COVID-specific tests in the period. Total inventory reserves for test strips, instrument returns, instrument components and Fast Lab's raw materials in the quarter were $3.8 million with Fast Lab's COVID inventory reserves contributing $2.4 million. Excluding instrument placements in these inventory reserves, adjusted gross margins would have been approximately 10%.Our restructuring programs have reduced our operating expenses sequentially over the last 5 consecutive quarters since we exited the Omicron wave and transitioned to endemic COVID. Since Q3 2022, when we initiated our cost reduction programs, we have decreased our annualized cost base by more than $100 million in line with our prior guidance.Our second quarter adjusted R&amp;D expenses were $14.3 million compared to $14.8 million in Q1 of this year and compared to $42.8 million in Q2 2022. Our second quarter adjusted SG&amp;A expenses were $17.6 million compared to $19 million in Q1 and $30.2 million in Q2 of 2022. The adjusted operating expense reductions from Q1 '23 to Q2 '23 are primarily related to decreased wages and other employee expenses. Adjusted operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and restructuring charges.We incurred $2.9 million of restructuring costs in the quarter as we finalized most of our latest cost-reduction program in June and anticipate additional cost savings in Q3 with the full benefit of these changes. At June 30, 2023, our cash balance was $25.3 million. On a cash basis, our quarterly cash interest paid reflected the payment of both the Q1 and Q2 cash interest on our senior debt within the second quarter.On July 20th, 2023, we executed a ninth Amendment to the loan agreement with our senior lender, which included an agreement to increase the loan facility with 2 new tranches of senior debt. On July 21st, we drew down the tranche B funding from the amendment for $15 million. We anticipate drawing down tranche C funding of $16 million before the end of August as we continue to manage our liquidity position.We will now pause for the operator to gather any questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) First question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.Matthew Carlisle SykesMaybe the first one. The ITAP submission for the flu COVID combo in the U.S. market. Could you just give us a sense for timing? Do you think that would be ready for the respiratory season in the U.S.? And you mentioned some conversations you're having with them. Just how are those going and any kind of color on timing would be helpful?Ron ZwanzigerWell, that's always a tricky question. That's certainly the intent of the folks we're dealing with at the ITAP. And so that is the expectation, but of course, there can never be assurance of that, but that is the expectation that we will have it in time for the quarter and certainly we've got customers lined up on that basis.Matthew Carlisle SykesGot it. And then maybe just 2 quick follow-ups. One, you had mentioned the press release the divestiture of the INRstar business and was there any kind of cash realized from that you guys have disclosed?Ron ZwanzigerDorian?Dorian LeBlancNo, no cash that we've disclosed that we realized from that transition. That's a business that is monitoring patients on warfarin and the software helps to provide the algorithm for the dosing. But we've seen with the warfarin patient population declining, that business was in decline and it did require some significant investment to maintain the software. So it was more of an avoidance of future investment than to realize proceeds.Matthew Carlisle SykesGot it. And just my last question, the relationship with CVS, which sounds like it's going well with some of the additional placements, could you just maybe talk about sort of your expectations, timing of rollout? I assume a lot of that is to capture the respiratory season in Q4, but maybe just talk about the expansion of that relationship and what it could mean from a non-COVID standpoint as we kind of go into the end of this year and into early '24?Ron ZwanzigerWell, probably it's best to remind you that we had a relationship with CVS that preceded the pandemic where we had a plan with them and many of the product selection of the order in which we're launching the non-COVID test was agreed with them well before the pandemic. Then, of course, there was this long hiatus and now we're coming back to it. So we're really sort of simply evolving back to what was originally intended pre-pandemic and of course, in the short term, that means the respiratory -- the first question you asked flu A and B and then, of course, there's other tests that will be coming through, both respiratory and non-respiratory. So there's a whole program of tests that we expect to go into that relationship.Now I don't know if you've sort of picked it up, but the significance of what's been going on in the second quarter and the expansion of the relationship is that we've taken it beyond the MinuteClinic where traditionally the tests are not done in the regular pharmacies, which do not have a MinuteClinic and so we've had a large number of instruments now go into the regular pharmacy.So it's quite a change in behavior and we think that that bodes really well for the future. There's quite a lot of tests which can be -- are needed in the community where you don't want to force people to go to just the MinuteClinics, which are crudely speaking, every 10th CVS where you want them to be able to have more reach and to go into more stores. So it's quite -- it's potentially quite significant change that we've had, positive change.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg.Jeffrey Scott CohenA couple of questions from our end. I guess, firstly, Ron, could you expand upon your commentary on Medtronic and talk about health checks with us a little deeper as far as what specific tests and what channels as far as coagulation and diabetes, cardiovascular?Ron ZwanzigerSure. Well, the issue with Medtronic is that they have a program into the community to try and screen out people with heart failure and of course, there is no community-based Fingerstick NT-proBNP tests. So when they have these programs, which they have them in various forms, but the one we're involved with is a mobile bus that literally goes into the community and they channel people through.So as soon as they heard about our test, they used it and straight away the impact was to identify people into 3 groups and this has repeated itself in the second test. So you referred to diabetes, but this particular program had started off at the moment it's [anti-pro-based], but it could expand. So even in these early results, they immediately showed that there's people walking out there that are so severe that they're going to decompensate and we've had an initial person send directly from the testing to the emergency room and then there were a bunch of other people which were sent to their primary care physician because it was elevated, but not yet in the critical state.And then, of course, fortunately, there's everyone else. So it showed the enormous benefit of actually being able to triage patients much earlier in the community and obviously therefore reduce the hospitalization or in the case of the person that went in, get the person in before they really deteriorate. So the point about the -- this program that they're running is it shows how you can deal with congestive heart failure far more effectively than you are now.And I should say that other countries that we're working with are going down the same path in quite a number of countries and there's a lot of key opinion leaders everywhere. That's why we dwelt upon it on the prepared remarks where in a host of different countries they can see how having a Fingerstick test in the community can do just what we've already identified so early on in this program with Medtronic. So it really shows the power of our platform.Jeffrey Scott CohenAnd Ron, is Medtronic driving this process? And are they distributor ordering goods from you? They're just sending...Ron ZwanzigerThere's no distribution. There's no distribution here with Medtronic. Just to be clear there's no distribution. It's because they have their own products in congestive heart failure. So they have tremendous advantage of catching people early based on their own -- on their own products, not test. We just happen to be a mechanism which allows for early -- earlier identification of people and catching people, congestive heart failure for much earlier treatment and therefore to avoid both deterioration those folks health and also saving money for the system.Jeffrey Scott CohenOkay. Got it. And are they piloting this or they're doing this across the U.S. now?Ron ZwanzigerNo, this is all in Europe because where we have the registration we will bring -- we will obviously bring this product into the U.S. we highlighted our prepared remarks that we've got our first 510(k) submission and then which covers the instrument and the strips and then the future submissions cover only the strips and we're obviously going to do flu A and flu B, but NT-pro is very early in the cycle of tests that we're going to bring into the U.S.Jeffrey Scott CohenOkay. Perfect. Okay. And then secondly for us, if you could just touch upon the 9.29 COVID with the composition of 4.4 technologies and 4.8 distribution, as far as the technologies go, could you -- and the distribution goes, could you give us a flavor and perhaps call out the 2 or 3 or 4 tests that are driving that thus far and then what we would expect for the back half as well as any back half commentary on COVID revenue?Ron ZwanzigerWell, even though it was a -- almost a non-flu season quarter, Q2, we had a lot of flu A and flu B testing in the quarter. But Dorian, maybe you can answer the question.Dorian LeBlancYes, we did. So just about half of that is still the respiratory testing within the 4.4 of the LumiraDx technologies, including a large portion for the Fast Labs business, as we mentioned, that transitioning to the majority of that business being flu COVID testing and on the distribution revenues, as you may recall, that's revenues for products that we don't manufacture sold primarily outside of the U.S. in Latin America and Europe for distribution agreements that we have in our sales organizations.OperatorThis question comes from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James.Andrew Harris CooperMaybe first just a little bit more detail, if you could give some of the progress that's been made through the quarter in terms of strep (inaudible) and I think you had commented you expected to be in trials with strep later this year. And then, Ron, I think you said potentially kind of on the market, at least in trial phase with troponin in the U.K. later this year. So just what is -- what has happened since the last update and anything else you could offer there would be great?Ron ZwanzigerWell, actually both. So in terms of new products, whether it's troponin or molecular strep, molecular strep, we expect to probably get out in the market in the fourth quarter in the U.K. And we're also looking at the various clinical trials needed for IVDR and 510(k) and troponin continues to move quite well and I think our previous comment was that we expect we might be able to get it towards the very end of the year and that's still the case.In terms of the (inaudible), specifically talk about in terms of self-registration in the U.K.Andrew Harris CooperOkay, helpful. And then maybe for Dorian, just the commentary about some of the run rate on expenses. Can you give us a flavor for sort of what's still to be recognized here in 3Q that wasn't fully baked in 2Q and kind of from the trajectory, what we should expect there? And then should we think that 3Q gross margins look more similar to that 10% type level that you called out as sort of the normalized increment ex-inventory reserve piece or more like what we saw in 2Q just now?Dorian LeBlancYes. So I'll take the gross margin piece first. It does depend heavily on what happens with the start of the respiratory season and around the timing of a potential approval for the flu COVID test through ITAP in the United States. So obviously, that high-value, high-margin respiratory product coming through in the end of the quarter, kind of a material impact on where we stand absent a strong contribution from that, then, yes, your comment around the 10% level at these revenue levels is on the mark. On the cost savings...Andrew Harris CooperMost of the -- I was just going to say, so we should expect more normalized levels from the kind of instrument drag perspective and then you feel like the inventory piece is pretty well reflected after the last write-offs?Dorian LeBlancWe would expect that, yes.Andrew Harris CooperOkay. Thank you. And then sorry. On the...Dorian LeBlancOn the expenses. Yes. So we did incur the close to $3 million of restructuring charges in the quarter and that's the -- largely around severance or reduction in the workforce. Most of those employees left in May, June and so there's the expense savings further on in employee costs in the third quarter. But as we had mentioned previously, some of that will be offset by an increase in U.S. clinical and regulatory expenses. So we will get some additional marginal savings in Q3. But as we start the work on the U.S. clinicals, on the respiratory products and on the community-based products to bring the European portfolio into the U.S., we will be using some of that cost savings for the clinical trial costs.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with BTIG.Mark Anthony MassaroRon, the first question is for you. I'm curious as to your degree of confidence around the duration of the NIH ITAP program. Obviously, you submitted your COVID alter test to the -- as a 510(k), but your COVID flu is the EUA through the ITAP. I'm just curious if you have visibility how long the EUA pathway through ITAP will be available as opposed to submitting regular way 510(k)s and any thoughts on timing expectations for the COVID flu test?Ron ZwanzigerWell, on your first question, there has been tremendous engagement and the continues to be. Probably -- we don't know this for sure, but probably because ours is the only multiplex high-performance test available and so we suspect that's the reason. And of course there's a lot of anxiety around because of the flu season. So yes, so the ITAP program continued to interact with us even though that in general there's obviously a sharp reduction in the U.S., but for this particular application it still seems to be there and so hence our comments before that we're hoping, well, there's no assurance, but we're hoping to be able to get it in time for the flu season and we're working with our customers. We're being patient, know the situation for that to happen.Your other comment, your other question about our first 510(k), I think that will follow the regular path and it's always very hard to estimate 510(k), particularly the first one on a new platform where you're submitting and the review process includes a great deal of focus both on the instruments as well as the particular strip in question. So it's a much greater amount of work than the second test you submit. But we submitted a very detailed and complete package and so I think that there'll be a back and forth with the FDA and I think the optimistic view might be before the end of the year. Otherwise into next year. But I think it's not far away. It's not too far away.Mark Anthony MassaroOkay, great. And then maybe one for you, Dorian. You're now tracking low $20 millions in the first 2 quarters of the year. Q3 is typically seasonally lighter. I don't think I heard you guide for Q3, but can you give us a sense for ballpark, do you think it will be down a little bit sequentially primarily due to seasonality? Or are there other offsets that could keep you flattish?Dorian LeBlancWell, it's a tricky question to answer, Mark, because the -- such a material impact around the timing of the flu COVID approval potentially in the U.S. and customers waiting on purchases, on the timing of that, on whether they'll utilize the 12-minute COVID antigen test in the U.S. or the flu COVID test. So tricky to guide to exactly where Q3 will land just because of such a material impact from the timing. Outside of that, we continue to see the non-COVID portfolio grow and as we talk to the number of customers that are taking multiple tests and continue to go quarter-on-quarter, we see that trend will carry us through the rest of the year as the menu expansion really plays well in Europe and that will drive the non-respiratory growth, but because respiratory is such a big contributor, hard to guide with the uncertainty around timing.Mark Anthony MassaroOkay. And then on the balance sheet, Dorian, I think you expect to draw $16 million by the end of next week. I think that'll take you to $41 million of cash. Is that cash sufficient, in your view, to get through the end of September? And just maybe, how should we think about cash runway?Dorian LeBlancYes, absolutely. The one other piece maybe to think about on cash runway is we do have a number of receivables on the books, not trade receivables, but particularly the tax receivables. So we have $25.2 million at the end of Q2 in tax receivables, largely from U.K. R&amp;D tax credits. We do anticipate that coming through before the end of the year and contributing significantly to liquidity and then we'll work on where we are with Pharmakon and future amendments and working through the overall liquidity for the fourth quarter. But the draw of $16 million will certainly take us through September.Mark Anthony MassaroOkay. Last question for me. Can you maybe explain what the measurement of the covenants in the Ninth Amendment, what that pertains to just -- I'm trying to get a sense for some of the details around the statement about the measurement there?Dorian LeBlancSo right now during the term of the Ninth Amendment, the only covenant that applies is the minimum liquidity covenant of $5 million. We have no other covenants that are in effect when the Ninth Amendment ends. Then we would return to the original revenue covenants that had us -- that were set during the pandemic and therefore outdated would need to be negotiated with our lender.Ron ZwanzigerMark, I'll just add to the first question about respiratory and revenues. So you made the comment that Q3 tends to be the weak -- in respiratory tends to be the weaker one, but actually Q2 tends to often be the weaker one than Q3 because Q3 sometimes gets the initial stocking orders for the fourth quarter flu season, but obviously because of the ITAP program, we don't know where we stand with the U.S., so that complicates matters. But then there's also the general complication of the flu season in Europe and Japan as well, making any comments particularly tricky.OperatorI am currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Ron Zwanziger for closing remarks.Ron ZwanzigerOkay. Thanks. So our transition to a non-COVID product portfolio continues to progress, especially with the commercial launches of the [A1c] test and the NT-proBNP test on our platform. Customer responses continue to be positive, supported by external clinical validations. So again, bringing together multiple assays on a single easy-to-use instrument with laboratory-equivalent performance and a low cost of ownership is enabling a transformation in community-based care.Now in parallel to the focus on our business and test expansion, we continue to work with various strategic advisors on the previously disclosed strategic review of our business with the support of our senior lender, which we're engaged in discussions with them about the terms of the loan agreement as amended to date, including the covenants in the Ninth Amendment, which are scheduled to be measured on September the 1st. While there have be no guarantees about the outcome of the strategic review process or our ability to renegotiate terms of the loan agreement with our senior lender, we remain committed to preserving and protecting the value of our business while we continue to aim to deliver on product expansion into the U.S. and commercial growth of our approved tests internationally. Thank you for your time and for your support of LumiraDx. Bye.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.]"

This is the first Phase 3 clinical program for an oral PCSK9 inhibitor. The first participants are now enrolling in two registrational Phase 3 studies evaluating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction: CORALreef Lipids and CORALreef HeFH. Merck also plans to initiate a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes study, CORALreef Outcomes by the end of 2023.PCSK9 is a validated target for lowering LDL cholesterol. However, there are no oral PCSK9 inhibitors available to physicians and patients. The Phase 3 CORALreef program follows robust Phase 2b results presented at ACC.23/WCC, in which MK-0616 significantly reduced LDL cholesterol compared to placebo at all doses studied in participants with hypercholesterolemia with a broad spectrum of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, including participants on high-intensity statin therapy. MK-0616 was generally well-tolerated.""Elevated LDL cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite several well-established lipid-lowering therapies, millions of people globally do not achieve and maintain their desired LDL cholesterol treatment goals, leaving them at risk for cardiac events,"" said Dr. Marc Sabatine, Chair of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group, the Lewis Dexter, MD, Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""MK-0616 showed statistically significant LDL cholesterol lowering activity in the Phase 2 trial and has the unique aspect of being a once daily pill. With its novel modality among PCSK9 inhibitors, MK-0616 could provide an important option for patients for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.""Story continues""The initiation of a comprehensive Phase 3 program is an important milestone in our goal to offer a highly effective oral medication that could be accessed by a broad population and potentially allow substantially more people to reach their LDL treatment goals,"" said Dr. Joerg Koglin, senior vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""In acknowledgment of the significant racial, ethnic and gender disparities in cardiovascular care, Merck is taking proactive measures to engage potential participants from populations that have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials of this type.""CORALreef Lipids (NCT05952856) is a randomized, double-blind study enrolling a broad group of participants, including participants with history of at least one major ASCVD event and those at intermediate to high risk for a first event. Participants must be treated with stable lipid lowering therapies, including at least a moderate or high intensity statin, or have documented statin intolerance. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MK-0616 compared with placebo on the mean percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol at Week 24. Participants will receive 20 mg of MK-0616 orally once daily for up to 52 weeks or placebo, on top of their background lipid lowering therapies.CORALreef HeFH (NCT05952869) is a similar study, focused on adult participants with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who are being treated with stable lipid lowering therapies, including at least a moderate or high intensity statin. The estimated primary completion date for CORALreef Lipids and CORALreef HeFH studies is September 2025.CORALreef Outcomes (TIMI 77) (NCT06008756) is a randomized, double-blind study in adult participants with high cardiovascular risk, who are being treated with stable lipid lowering therapies, including at least a moderate or high intensity statin. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of MK-0616 compared with placebo, on top of background lipid lowering therapies, in increasing the time to the first occurrence of one of the following events: coronary heart disease death, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, acute limb ischemia or major amputation, or urgent arterial revascularization. Merck is collaborating with the TIMI Study Group, a leading academic research organization for cardiovascular clinical trials, on the CORALreef Outcomes study. The estimated primary completion date is November 2029.Merck’s broad, global Phase 3 program for MK-0616 aims to enroll approximately 17,000 participants across the CORALreef Lipids, CORALreef HeFH and CORALreef Outcomes studies.About PCSK9 and MK-0616PCSK9 plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis by regulating levels of the LDL receptor, which is responsible for the uptake of cholesterol into cells. Inhibition of PCSK9 prevents the interaction of PCSK9 with LDL receptors. This results in greater numbers of LDL receptors available on the cell surface to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.MK-0616 is an investigational, potentially first oral PCSK9 inhibitor designed to lower LDL cholesterol via the same biological mechanism as currently approved injectable PCSK9 inhibitors but in a daily pill form. MK-0616 is a macrocyclic peptide that binds to PCSK9 and inhibits the interaction of PCSK9 with LDL receptors.About HypercholesterolemiaHypercholesterolemia, a disorder in which there are elevated LDL cholesterol levels in the blood, affects approximately 86 million adults in the U.S., with nearly 25 million having very high total cholesterol above 240 mg/dL. It is a major risk factor associated with ASCVD, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and globally. Despite adjusting diet and taking statin therapies, many patients with hypercholesterolemia are still not reaching, or maintaining, their LDL cholesterol lowering goals as recommended by guidelines. High LDL cholesterol, if left untreated, can lead to a high risk of ASCVD events, such as heart attacks and strokes.Merck’s Focus on Cardiovascular DiseaseMerck has a long history of developing treatments for cardiovascular disease.

The primary endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230825671284/en/Two planned interim analyses were conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) over an 11-month period. In the first analysis, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS and ORR versus KEYTRUDA plus placebo. At the second analysis, KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA did not demonstrate an improvement in OS compared to KEYTRUDA plus placebo, and the likelihood of reaching the protocol-specified threshold for statistical significance for OS was evaluated by Merck and Eisai and deemed to be low. Accordingly, the study will be closed, and the companies are informing investigators of this decision. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA was consistent with previously reported data on the combination. A full evaluation of the data from this study, including pre-planned subgroup analyses, is ongoing. The companies will work with investigators to share the results with the scientific community.""With the LEAP-010 trial, we aimed to explore whether this combination could improve upon options already available with KEYTRUDA-based regimens for appropriate patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC,"" said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Although the progression-free survival results from this study were encouraging, unfortunately, the combination did not result in an overall survival benefit for patients. We will apply lessons from this trial to help continue advancing research of this combination.""Story continues""While we were initially encouraged to see that KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA met two of its three primary endpoints at an earlier interim analysis, unfortunately the combination did not meet the threshold for the third primary endpoint of overall survival,"" said Corina Dutcus, M.D., Senior Vice President, Global Clinical Development, Oncology at Eisai Inc. ""Our clinical program is designed to help accelerate our efforts to tackle difficult-to-treat, advanced cancers, and while the outcome may not always be what we anticipate, we know that this is part of clinical development, and we remain committed to scientific exploration in pursuit of improving care for patients.""KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA is approved in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and certain types of advanced endometrial carcinoma. Lenvatinib is marketed as KISPLYX® for advanced RCC in the EU. Merck and Eisai are studying the KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA combination through the LEAP (LEnvatinib And Pembrolizumab) clinical program in various tumor types, including but not limited to endometrial carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, RCC, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer across multiple clinical trials. KEYTRUDA is currently approved as monotherapy and in combination regimens for appropriate patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan and other countries around the world.Results from the LEAP-010 trial do not affect the current approved indications for KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA or other ongoing trials from the LEAP clinical program, including the ongoing LEAP-009 trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with LENVIMA versus chemotherapy in people living with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who progressed after platinum therapy and immunotherapy.About LEAP-010LEAP-010 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04199104) evaluating KEYTRUDA plus LENVIMA versus KEYTRUDA monotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1. The trial’s three primary endpoints are OS, PFS and ORR. PFS and ORR were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST) v1.1 modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study enrolled an estimated 511 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive:KEYTRUDA (200 mg intravenously [IV] on Day 1 of each three-week cycle) plus LENVIMA (20 mg orally once daily); orKEYTRUDA (200 mg IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle plus placebo (orally once daily).In both arms, KEYTRUDA was administered for up to 35 cycles (approximately two years) or until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met. After completing two years of combination therapy, LENVIMA may have been administered as a single agent until protocol-specified discontinuation criteria were met.About head and neck cancerHead and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas that begin in the flat, squamous cells that make up the thin surface layer of the structures in the head and neck. Two substances that increase the risk of developing head and neck cancer are tobacco and alcohol. Worldwide, it is estimated there were more than 930,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and over 465,000 deaths from the disease in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be more than 66,000 new cases of head and neck cancer diagnosed and more than 15,000 deaths from the disease in 2023.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Head and Neck Squamous Cell CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with platinum and fluorouracil (FU), is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or with unresectable, recurrent HNSCC whose tumors express PD-L1 [Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥1] as determined by an FDA-approved test.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

The filing due date for the briefs are Sept. 18 for the Merck lawsuit and Oct. 6 for PhRMA.There are additional lawsuits that have been filed over these negotiations, including by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) — which have been consolidated to a single court in New Jersey.AARP officials said they expect more lawsuits to be filed once the list of targeted drugs is published on Aug. 29, just days before the Sept. 1 deadline CMS had originally set.On a media call on Thursday, AARP officials argued the drug companies' goal is to fast-track the issue to the US Supreme Court.""They're trying to get as many cases filed as they can, across multiple [court] circuits, so that they all end up, or some of them end up, in front of the Supreme Court,"" said Kelly Bagby, vice president of litigation at the AARP Foundation.AARP logo displayed on a smartphone screen and in the background. (Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)Some Wall Street analysts have echoed the idea the goal for plaintiffs is to reach the Supreme Court, and said the move is unlikely to delay the negotiation process. Negotiated prices are set to go into effect for the 2026 plan year.The lawsuits allege the powers granted to Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices of the most expensive single-source drugs are unconstitutional.They cite the First Amendment, or freedom of speech, alleging they are being forced into the negotiated pricing process; the Fifth Amendment, or unlawful government seizure, alleging that Medicare is taking the drugs at the negotiated price; and the Eighth Amendment, or excessive fines, for the fines Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Story continuesLeigh Purvis, AARP Public Policy Institute's prescription drug policy principal, said that the negotiation process is ""not a hostage situation.""""Drug companies do have options. One is that they can withdraw their products from Medicare and Medicaid, and the other is they can allow generic competitors on the market. You do not have to participate in the negotiation process if you are not a single-source drug,"" Purvis said.Drug companies have threatened that negotiated prices will hamper innovation and that drug prices are not set based on the cost of production, but rather the ""value add,"" or the value of lifestyle improvement and avoidance of costly hospital visits gained.Purvis said that on the latter argument, companies don't have ""any evidence that what they are bringing to the table actually offers value.""Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The company's current stock price is $302.22, while the GF Value, an estimation of its fair value, stands at $333.73.Is Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK) Modestly Undervalued?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure of the intrinsic value of a stock, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it indicates overvaluation and potentially poor future returns. Conversely, if it's significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, suggesting higher future returns.With a market cap of $34.70 billion and a current price of $302.22 per share, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) shows signs of being modestly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesIs Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK) Modestly Undervalued?Financial Strength AnalysisAssessing the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing in its stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. The cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage offer valuable insights into a company's financial strength. Rockwell Automation's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.11 is inferior to 91.21% of 2720 companies in the Industrial Products industry. Overall, Rockwell Automation's financial strength is rated 6 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.Is Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK) Modestly Undervalued?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, particularly those with consistent long-term profitability, is generally less risky. Rockwell Automation has been profitable 10 times over the past 10 years. With an operating margin of 18.87%, it ranks better than 90.15% of 2801 companies in the Industrial Products industry. Overall, Rockwell Automation's profitability is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Company growth is a vital factor in valuation. The faster a company grows, the more likely it is to create value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Rockwell Automation's 3-year average annual revenue growth rate is 5.8%, which ranks below 51.52% of 2669 companies in the Industrial Products industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 8.4%, which ranks below 52.35% of 2359 companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) can also provide insights into its profitability. The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Rockwell Automation's ROIC was 13.91, while its WACC stood at 11.06.ConclusionIn conclusion, Rockwell Automation's stock appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. However, its growth ranks below 52.35% of 2359 companies in the Industrial Products industry.

The Integrated Methane Monitoring Platform Extension project will expand this work to interstate and customer natural gas assets.The project will also offer a standardized framework for methane measurement and quantification that can extend to upstream components, including midstream transmission and storage, and upstream production and gathering facilities.""We are proud of our industry-leading role in methane reduction,"" said Sasha Weintraub, senior vice president and president of Duke Energy's natural gas business. ""This is a great example of innovation and collaboration, and we are excited to integrate and deploy methane emissions tracking to help decarbonize the natural gas value chain.""The project includes the Williams-owned Transco pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Duke Energy. Methane emissions monitoring tools will be deployed at a compressor station on the pipeline, expanding Williams' use of innovative ground-based, aerial and satellite emissions tools currently used to gather data as part of its enterprise-wide NextGen Gas strategy.Story continues""Collaboration with our downstream customers like Duke Energy is crucial to advance the use of technology and to create opportunities to reduce emissions throughout the entire natural gas supply chain,"" said Chad Zamarin, executive vice president of corporate strategic development at Williams. ""As an industry, it's critical that energy suppliers, customers and academics work together to share information and develop best practices to measure and reduce emissions, ultimately making certified low-carbon gas available to consumers.""The project will take place in North Carolina later this year and will leverage academia, natural gas operations, digital and advanced cloud computing technologies as well as data science to deploy, measure and analyze methane emissions data. The project scope includes:Piloting measurement technologies such as satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and aerial light detection and ranging, to detect and quantify methane emissions on both local distribution and upstream natural gas assets.Testing continuous methane-monitoring technologies on both local distribution and midstream natural gas assets using monitoring sensors, gas cloud imaging cameras and handheld/portable gas-sensing analyzers to detect and quantify methane emissions.Analyzing data from the various technologies to better understand their performance, operational effectiveness and accuracy in different environments and weather scenarios.Leveraging the results of the technology pilots and data architecture and design to develop a platform and strategic deployment plan to inform the Integrated Methane Monitoring Platform.Video: Learn more about Duke Energy's methane emissions-monitoring platform here.Decarbonizing the natural gas systemDuke Energy's environmental goals for its natural gas local distribution companies are to achieve net-zero methane emissions by 2030 for its own operations (Scope 1 emissions) and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 for natural gas purchases upstream and sold to customers downstream (Scope 3 emissions).To achieve these goals, Duke Energy is reducing methane leaks on its system, working with upstream suppliers on their efforts to reduce and eliminate emissions and offering customers opportunities to purchase renewable natural gas (RNG) and carbon offsets. Duke Energy also offers energy efficiency programs that provide incentives for customers to install high-efficiency natural gas equipment.Duke Energy also is investing in RNG, an important tool to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. RNG is considered carbon neutral because it displaces geological gas and reduces the release of methane to the atmosphere. The company is sourcing RNG for use at compressed natural gas stations, providing transportation customers with a gasoline or diesel alternative, resulting in a reduced carbon footprint.Duke EnergyDuke Energy (NYSE: DUK), a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., is one of America's largest energy holding companies.

Any solution that actually scales up, first, has to be technically possible,"" he said.It's one reason why he believes that, if the aviation sector really is to reach its goal of hitting net-zero by 2050, so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) will be a major part of the solution.“If the objective is to radically reduce carbon emissions by 2050, there will be a lot of airplanes–60% to 70%–looking a lot like the ones we fly today,” Raymond said. (Planes don’t require significant re-engineering to switch from jet fuel to SAFs, which emit much less CO2).Electric planes can only carry the ""lower end"" of passenger volume, Raymond said, as the size and weight of current batteries make larger planes unfeasible. He also doesn't see hydrogen-fueled planes as being the solution. ""There won't be a lot,"" according to the Boeing CSO, due to incompatible infrastructure, design challenges, and the lack of abundant, cheap, and green hydrogen.On hearing these sober predictions, I wondered whether Boeing and other incumbents weren't like car manufacturers before the arrival of Elon Musk's Tesla: lacking both an outside-the-box vision and stratospheric levels of ambition.Raymond assured me that wasn't the case.""You have to advocate for 2050 targets. You also have to look for Elon Musk engineers who explore different ways that are not technically possible yet. And that’s what we’re trying to do,"" he explained.Story continuesRaymond acknowledged that sustainability is always part of the conversation with the new generation of talent, with no room for sophistry.“[They] are educated on sustainability, whatever their discipline is. They’re more aware, and a lot of them are minoring in environmental science, and they are going to work for a values-based, purpose-driven company,” he said. ""They sniff out"" if you’re not serious.Separately, read the latest piece from my colleague Jessica Mathews, which explores “what has quietly become one of the surest paths to an enviable job in Silicon Valley.""

(Photo: Joramco)Boeing is establishing its eighth production line for converting Boeing 737-800 passenger aircraft to freighters after agreeing with Amman, Jordan-based maintenance and repair company Joramco to carry out the aftermarket work.Joramco, a subsidiary of service company Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, is the first site in the Middle East to support Boeing’s 737-800 conversion program. It will reconfigure used aircraft for customers in the Middle East, Europe, North Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Dubai Aerospace Enterprise has a leasing company with 550 aircraft, including 140 of the 737 family. Tuesday’s announcement suggested that DAE Capital would utilize Joramco to overhaul some of its own 737s for dedicated cargo business.Joramco has expanded to occupy five hangars with 22 maintenance lines by the end of 2024.“We continue to look for opportunities to bring freighter conversion capacity closer to our customers,” said Mike Doellefeld, Boeing’s vice president of engineering services, converted freighters and subcomponents, in the news release.Boeing did not provide details about the Joramco supplier relationship, such as when the new production line will be ready to begin work and any initial orders that will be sent to Amman. It typically takes more than a year for Boeing (NYSE: BA) partners to set up a hangar for conversion, acquire the necessary technology and tooling, and train staff.The expansion of Boeing’s conversion program comes in the middle of a serious downturn in air cargo volumes that has resulted in a sharp reduction in orders for converted freighters by lessors and all-cargo operators. During the pandemic, when air cargo capacity was at a premium, passenger-to-freighter conversions were the rage. Rising values of narrowbody aircraft at a time when manufacturers are having difficulty meeting commitments for factory-built planes is also discouraging investment in conversions.But Boeing’s outlook sees a need for 1,300 standard-size freighter conversions, such as the 737-800 and Airbus A321, by 2040. Boeing has delivered more than 130 converted 737-800s, with a backlog of 120 orders and commitments. In March, Boeing announced plans to activate a 737-800 production line in India.Story continuesBoeing 737-800 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter) at SJO/Juan Santamaria Int’l Airport.Costa Rica is a beautiful country pic.twitter.com/PqSLEr9IDp— #cockpitview (@lonlowe) August 22, 2023Cooperativa Autogestionaria de Servicios Aeroindustriales, a licensed partner in Costa Rica that installed its first conversion kit in January, recently completed a modification for WestJet Cargo, according to a post on social media showing the finished plane at the San Juan airport. WestJet started its freighter airline earlier this year with three leased aircraft. Spokesperson Madison Kruger said the airline received the plane earlier this month and that it is scheduled to enter service on Sept. 2. The fourth 737-800 took longer to convert because it was a WestJet passenger aircraft that required different modifications than the other aircraft.Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.Contact reporter: ekulisch@freightwaves.com RECOMMENDED READING:Boeing adds 737-800 conversion line in IndiaThe post Boeing adds Middle East site for 737-800 cargo conversions appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

As a result, their real estate markets exploded. The obvious play for real estate investors might be apartment REITs with assets concentrated in the Sun Belt.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE:MAA) is an S&amp;P 500 company with a heavy concentration in the Sun Belt. Over 55% of its portfolio is in Texas, Florida and Georgia.Camden Property Trust (NYSE:CPT) is another S&amp;P 500 REIT that has invested heavily in the Sun Belt. More than half of the company's net operating income (NOI) is derived from major markets in Florida, Georgia and Texas.But there is another investment opportunity that is gaining popularity, especially as the stock market has become increasingly volatile. Private market real estate funds and fractional investing allow retail investors to be more selective in the specific markets and properties they invest in.One investment platform even allows individuals to invest in the growth of specific cities. While the median sale price of homes across the U.S. is up only 1.8% year-over-year, according to data from Redfin, prices in markets like Dallas and Miami are up 5.2% and 10.4%, respectively.Trending: Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Retail investors can also choose to buy shares of specific long-term and short-term rental properties in several markets across the U.S. In fact, Jeff Bezos made an early investment in a company that offers shares of rental properties with a minimum investment of only $100.The benefit to these types of investments is that their performance isn't tied to the stock market. Share prices of private funds and fractional investments is directly related to the value of the assets and the income they continue to generate.Story continuesThe downside, however, to some investors is the available liquidity. Redemption options are often limited within the target investment term. While this helps protect the long-term value of the investment, it's important that investors only contribute capital that they're comfortable leaving tied up for five years or more.Read next:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Moreover, the redevelopment program and technology initiatives and a solid balance sheet bode well for the company’s long-term growth despite a high-interest-rate environment and elevated supply in certain markets.MAA’s portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals. The pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets, as renters seek more business-friendly, low-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units amid a high-interest-rate environment continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid this, our projections for top-line growth point to an increase of 6.3% year over year in the current year.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of the Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion. We expect same-store net operating income (NOI) to grow 6.6% in 2023 and 7.9% in 2024.MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Jun 30, 2023, MAA had a strong balance sheet with $1.4 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility. It generated 95.1% unencumbered NOI in the second quarter of 2023, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to that. In the last five years, MAA has increased its dividend six times, and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 7.91%.However, the struggle to lure renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some of its markets. This is expected to put some pressure on rent growth in the upcoming periods. Furthermore, stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets is concerning.Also, elevated rates imply a high borrowing cost for the company, which will affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than yields on fixed income and money-market accounts due to high interest rates.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 0.7% in the past three months against the industry's increase of 3.1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the residential REIT sector are Invitation Home INVH and American Homes 4 Rent AMH.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.68 on the 19th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This will take the annual payment to 2.6% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions Skyworks Solutions' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Skyworks Solutions' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 51.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 30% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendSkyworks Solutions Is Still Building Its Track RecordIt is great to see that Skyworks Solutions has been paying a stable dividend for a number of years now, however we want to be a bit cautious about whether this will remain true through a full economic cycle. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.44 total annually to $2.72. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 22% over that duration. The dividend has been growing rapidly, however with such a short payment history we can't know for sure if payment can continue to grow over the long term, so caution may be warranted.We Could See Skyworks Solutions' Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Skyworks Solutions has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 5.4% per annum. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Skyworks Solutions' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. The payout ratio looks good, but unfortunately the company's dividend track record isn't stellar. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.35%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 1.08%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 1.87%.Heading into today, shares of the athletic apparel maker had lost 9.65% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 3.68% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.06% in that time.Nike will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Nike is projected to report earnings of $0.73 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 21.51%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $12.98 billion, up 2.29% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.72 per share and revenue of $53.69 billion. These totals would mark changes of +15.17% and +4.83%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Nike. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Nike is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Nike's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 26.55. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.48.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that NKE currently has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer, Alexandra Canal, and Pras Subramanian discuss the Jordan brand and Michael Jordan's net worth, estimated to be $3.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: I want to talk about footwear. Because if you're coming in the office, you've got to wear shoes, right?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes.[INTERPOSING VOICES]JOSH SCHAFER: And it's been interesting. I've been following some of the different earnings calls we've seen from these sports retailers over the last couple of days and we saw from Foot Locker, obviously, not doing well again this quarter. They're seeing some slowdown in particularly lower income consumers and in that discretionary spend when it comes to shoes. DICK'S reporting also a little bit of a slowdown in parts of footwear.But what's been strong at both of those brands and just keeps continually being strong is Nike and Jordan brand. Jordan brand continues to set records for how much it is selling products. That collectors' market still seems to be good. And I saw some news out today that it seems like Michael Jordan, as expected, is benefiting significantly from those shoes--ALEXANDRA CANAL: He making the money.JOSH SCHAFER: --being sold a lot.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, I mean, he is a billionaire. He's a three-and-a-half billionaire, right? I mean he's got-- he made a ton of money off that Charlotte Hornets sale.ALEXANDRA CANAL: He makes, some reported, $255 million every year from Nike.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: From Jordan-- yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: That is crazy.JOSH SCHAFER: And I think the Jordan brand itself does over $6 billion now in revenue.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Which is, I'm still shocked. The guy hasn't played in 20 years, right? I know they have different athletes that they sign, but it's surprising to me, like, how popular the resale market is. The reissuing of the old Jordans still a big deal. Whoever's running their strategy, like, of grand releases and limited releases, just doling that in the right amount of time is, like, perfect. And Jordan is--Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: It comes in so many places they're having to promo, too. When you've read--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I was going to ask--JOSH SCHAFER: --through a lot of these earnings calls--ALEXANDRA CANAL: --are they discounting Jordans?JOSH SCHAFER: --it's been highly promotional.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I've never seen Jordans on sale.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Every now and then, yes. I do--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Rarely, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: I try and go online and just see what's on sale and stuff when we're talking about these shoe things. And every now and then you do see, like this summer, they did a little bit of a sale on some of the Jordans, but not the Jordans shoe drops that they're doing.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Are the inventory [INAUDIBLE]? Like not-- like is Jordan just always selling out? Because I know inventory is a very big problem.JOSH SCHAFER: The Jordans shoe drops are selling out.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And they make like--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Wow!PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --they make Jordan, like, workout shoes, so it's not like the Jordans that he would wear. Those are, kind of, always discounted. But it's the, like, the actual basketball, the Jordans in the original colors, the colorways that come out, those are never on sale.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Interesting.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Never.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I'm not really a sneakerhead, but I know the market is sick.JOSH SCHAFER: Pras and I both have Jordans and we didn't wear them today.]"

""And I'd say we find it unacceptable and needs to be addressed.""Shares fell 4.3% in after-hours trading, reversing gains of as much as 6% on better than expected sales and earnings. Nordstrom's stock fell 1% in pre-market trading on Friday.The company reported sales dropped 8.3% compared to the same time period last year, with Nordstrom attributing the decline to the timing of its Anniversary Sale, which pulled one week into the third quarter from the second. The company also wound down its Canadian operations during the quarter.Without these two impacts, sales would have fallen nearly 4%. Performance at the company's Nordstrom Rack outlet stores also outperformed its flagship brand stores, falling 4.1% after an 11.9% drop in the first quarter.The company reiterated its 2023 outlook.Nordstrom expects retail sales and credit card revenues to drop between 4% and 6% compared to last year and adjusted earnings to come in between $1.80 and $2.20, excluding charges related to the wind-down of its Canadian business.On a call with investors following the results, CFO Catherine Smith said consumers are still cautious.""It remains to be seen how changes in inflation and higher interest rates will affect discretionary consumer spending in the second half of the year, particularly during the holiday season,"" Smith warned.The earnings rundownHere are Nordstrom's Q2 results versus estimates, according to Bloomberg data.Net sales: $3.66 billion vs. $3.61 billion expectedAdjusted EPS: $0.84 vs. $0.44 expectedSegment revenue: Nordstrom: $2.49 billion vs. $2.47 billionNordstrom Rack: $1.17 billion vs. $1.10 billionCredit card: $100 million vs. $107.35 millionSame-store sales: -8.3% vs. -10.34%Inventories: -17.5% compared to a year agoStory continuesOverall sales dropped 8.3%. Net sales for the namesake Nordstrom brand dropped 10%, while its off-price business Nordstrom Rack saw sales decrease 4.1%. Sales of activewear with brands like HOKA, On Running (ONON), New Balance, and Nike (NKE), as well as beauty products, grew by low-single digits. Kids' and men's apparel outperformed previous quarters.Sales of accessories and handbags showed strength at Nordstrom Rack, but designer brands are still under pressure.A general view of the atmosphere as Nordstrom Rack opens a new store on Aug. 17, 2023 in Aurora, Colo. (Tom Cooper/Getty Images for Nordstrom Rack) (Tom Cooper via Getty Images)What else we're watching: Digital sales decline, inventory, credit card revenue, theftDigital sales, which made up 36% of total sales in Q2, declined nearly 13%, driven lower by Nordstrom Rack eliminating the fulfillment of digital orders in store and shuttering its styling service Trunk Club in the quarter.The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale had a negative impact on digital sales too, per the release.Inventory, a key issue for Nordstrom in Q2 2022, dropped 17.5% compared to last year. CEO Nordstrom said the team is ""focused on managing inventory with greater discipline"" by improving mix and productivity.Credit card revenues were up 10% in the first half of the year, driven higher by its credit card partner agreement and lower-than-expected credit card losses.""We have seen delinquencies rising gradually, and they are now above pre-pandemic levels, which could result in higher credit losses in the second half and into 2024,"" Smith said though.Typically, its credit customer is loyal, resilient, and is a ""little higher-quality credit consumer.""What analysts are saying post earnings:""Progress year to date has been meaningful across Rack assortment, a key catalyst, rightsizing inventory, and supply chain efficiency. Going forward, executing on 2H guide should be important for sentiment, with margin normalization next year also a focus point."" -Jefferies, Ashley Helgans""There are certainly signs here that initiatives around Rack and overall operational efficiencies are taking hold. Rack improved materially from down 12% to down 4%, including a notable headwind from the removal of in-store fulfillment. Inventories ended the quarter down 17.5%. Management noted a strong Anniversary Sale, with sell-through that allows for even cleaner inventories looking into the second half, which should help support continued gross margin improvement. And finally, the company has been able to maintain margin despite softer sales and the loss of the Canadian business, which ran at an EBIT margin level considerably above the core business. Despite these improvements, we would call out more general weakness in the fundamentals pointing to greater uncertainty ahead. Management spoke to a potential worsening consumer backdrop with growing delinquency rates within its private label credit card balance and decelerating trends into August (similar to commentary from Macy’s).""-William Blair, Dylan Carden""We continue to think the Street underestimates pressure on JWN earnings from share loss as consumers' move to online pureplay channels, retailers with better value-for-money propositions such as TJX, and brands' own stores and websites.""-UBS, Jay SoleBrooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""We are committed to retailing women’s goalkeeping jerseys for major tournaments in the future.”Earps’ club Manchester United said earlier Thursday that her No. 27 shirt was its second best-selling women’s replica shirt so far this season, behind Lionesses teammate Ella Toone.___AP World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup]"

They're just making choices on who they're shopping with, and they're choosing our brand.- So we've seen that consumers continue to spend just not on big ticket items. We saw it in retail sales last week, which surprised everyone with how much people are shopping. So let's bring back in Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers chief strategist. They're still shopping, but they're being a little bit more picky or choosy about where they're placing value in their purchases right now clearly.Story continuesSTEVE SOSNICK: Perfect way to lead into that. Yes, it's exactly what I think we're seeing. Remember, the consumer is still 2/3 of the economy. And so we really have to be concerned with what consumers are doing. But people have jobs, right? The unemployment rate is flirting with record lows. And so those who want a job have one. And when people have jobs, they can and do spend money.But I think people are getting a bit more nervous. They're a bit more cautious. You know, remember, call it a third of the country is-- sorry-- dealing with energy bills that they've never had to deal with before. That's got to come from someplace. You know, a huge segment of the population is going to have to start paying their student loan payments again, which that money's got to come from someplace. And so as a result, I think consumers have the money to spend.They are spending, but they're being very selective. And I think also, there's a very big value proposition in where they're spending it. You saw Walmart same store sales increase. TJ Maxx same store sales increase kind of at the expense of Target, which was better than feared but still down.And Abercrombie, you know, was a big winner. I'm too old and too heavy to shop there. But the footwear stocks got-- people-- the younger consumer with a little money in his or her pocket is going Abercrombie. They're not going to Foot Locker. They're not buying Nike's this time around. Fashion moves in cycles.And I do-- so I do think what we're seeing is caution. Not concern, but some of the-- but we did really punish some of the losers, the broad line-- a lot of the broad line retailers when you think about Macy's and I know Brian Sozzi's favorite Kohl's.- How do we bring all this back to the inflation picture? Because you think about the retail, the overall retail sales number that we got 2 weeks ago now was a blowout, then you have all these really choppy retail numbers.You would think with the hot retail sales number, that would have negative implications for inflation in terms of not allowing it to abate as much. But of course as always, it's murkier now that we've got all the individual ones. So how do we factor all that in?STEVE SOSNICK: I think this is the kind of thing that Powell is going to allude to tomorrow is that the consumer is healthy. They're spending their money. It does allow some certain segments to pass along price increases, which does fuel inflation. And so the cautious consumer-- a cautious consumer doesn't mean the consumer has gone away. It just means that they've changed the mix of their spending, and they're trying to spend it more on staples.But we really haven't heard from, let's say, the consumer goods companies saying that they're cutting prices. They may not have-- this quarter, they may not have passed along as many price increases that they did the prior quarter. But you didn't hear of anybody saying, demand stinks, we're going to have to start cutting. And so until or unless that happens or until or unless they say we cannot raise prices, you have to assume that they at least, will try until it's proven otherwise.]"

The Des Moines-based food YouTuber sears her petite pork chops to perfection on a four-inch stovetop. Rice, gravy, and a teeny-tiny biscuit adorn her palm-sized platter. It might only take Howell a few moments to eat this miniature meal, but she hopes you'll stick around to watch her cook the next compact culinary creation.Her food might be small, but her dreams are big. ""My biggest dream is to work with Disney or Pixar on a miniature movie,"" she said. ""And I want to open a miniature restaurant. I've been telling people this for years now.""Taught by her chef father, Howell combined an early love of tiny toys with cooking, which eventually turned into a hobby and then a job. The former Chicago schoolteacher, with the help of her son, makes a few videos each week cooking petite dishes in her dining room.""I get up at 4:30 in the morning and I start making short videos,"" Howell said. ""It's work.""Finding ways to turn her nontraditional business into income brought Howell to the Drake University Business Clinic in Des Moines. And she's far from alone. The school's business accelerator has helped many budding and established entrepreneurs across Iowa take their often out-there ideas to the next level through rigorous group classes. Students are expected to develop their passion and walk out with a business plan, investor pitch deck, or commercial loan application.""If a student has been through other [business] programs before, no one's ever challenged them on what their value proposition is,"" said Bill Adamowski, who heads the accelerator. ""Starting a business is tough. … We basically address the top reasons that startups fail.""Adamowski knows the ups and downs of running a business, from launching an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange to joining the C-suite of large financial services companies. As Drake's executive director of entrepreneurship, innovation, and human-centered design, he shares this experience through the program. The work is possible in part due to a $1 million Wells Fargo grant supporting the Drake University Small Business Clinic and the Evelyn K. Davis Center, a Des Moines-based business and career development organization that often refers clients to Drake after they complete coaching through its Business Boot Camp.Story continuesThe accelerator primarily draws people who are underrepresented in the business community. Roughly two in three participants are Black or African American and about 60% are women. Their need for business coaching is often greater because of the additional challenges they face, such as raising startup money. Adamowski cites CNBC data showing that while 30% of all businesses fail after two years, 80% of Black-owned businesses fail within 18 months. That's despite the fact that women, especially women of color, start businesses at higher rates.""We don't really make a difference unless we create successful businesses,"" Adamowski said. ""That's where the program makes a difference.""Howell, who was in the middle of the program this spring, hasn't cast the next step of her business yet, but Adamowski is helping her envision what could be: catering, mall kiosks, pop-ups, tiny kitchenware, and more.""I don't want to lose my dream of my miniature shop,"" she said, ""My work could go a whole lot of different places in the world.""Like son, like fatherOn Sundays, Garrison Goodlett can typically be found behind his church's fryer making chicken. That community connection was the inspiration for G.G.'s Chicken &amp; Waffles, a pop-up restaurant that Garrison Goodlett runs when he's off the clock as a financial counselor.""If you can be the chicken fryer for a predominantly Black church, you're doing something right. We will tell you if it isn't good,"" he said. ""I don't want to just be a business that sells food. I want to be a business that also connects with people and stands out with a positive message.""While Garrison Goodlett already had the drive and cooking talents, the Drake accelerator was where he learned how to pitch G.G.'s Chicken and Waffles to get into larger venues. His sights are set on the Iowa State Fair, the state's biggest event.""The next step is a food truck, and if we can get to the fair, that would be a game changer,"" he said.Garrison Goodlett's business manager is his father, Garry Goodlett, another graduate of Drake's accelerator. The retired family physician is launching a venture based on his invention: the Legg Buddy, a device that treats deep vein thrombosis, which nearly 1 million Americans are diagnosed with each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Garry Goodlett sees enormous potential in his invention, a vision he's put together because of accelerator courses on things like commercialization. If the Legg Buddy were to earn just a fraction of the existing market, it could see hundreds of millions in sales across the globe each year, according to his analysis. Garry Goodlett credits his son's referral to the accelerator as the launch pad for this big ambition.""[The Drake program] catapulted my idea from the embryonic stage,"" he said. ""I've gotten input from some who I consider titans in the business community, and I've had quite a bit of enthusiasm.""The spiciest peppers in IowaWhat do a circus performer and a heavy metal drummer get up to during the pandemic lockdown? Learn to grow the spiciest peppers in Iowa.The secret, as Charlie and Celestino Ramirez have perfected, is to boost the pepper plant's spicy defense mechanism through horticultural torture.We bring them to the point of death and then bring them back,"" Celestino Ramirez said. ""[We're in the] fifth generation of that process, so it gets hotter and hotter every single time.""While the husband and wife duo are still professional entertainers, today their main jobs are growing and selling these fire-hot peppers as the Sweatshop Pepper Farm, their food processing company. Their products range from salsa kits and seasoned chips to tins of infused peppers and even keychains to store on-the-go spices.The Drake accelerator graduates sought out the program for ways to expand their business. The courses pushed them to incorporate direct feedback from customers at farmers markets into product experimentation. Instead of focusing on the hottest peppers, the two began offering a spectrum of spice levels. Today, the mildest products are their top sellers.""It literally opened our eyes to a brand-new way of thinking when it came to our business. Right from the get-go, it took our little salsa business and put it in the forefront,"" Celestino Ramirez said. ""We brought them a hunk of steel and they helped us mold it and grind it. It gave us an edge.""A year and a half into business, the two sell wholesale products across the country. While it used to be a side gig, Sweatshop Pepper Farm is helping fund their return to live entertainment.""He plays the fastest double bass you've ever heard, and I like to perform on chains,"" Charlie Ramirez said. ""It's a little wacky.""Wells Fargo, Thursday, August 24, 2023, Press release pictureThe Drake University Business Clinic has helped budding entrepreneurs around Iowa develop their business plans, including (from left) Celestino and Charlie Ramirez of Sweatshop Pepper Farm, Garrison Goodlett of G.G.'s Chicken and Waffles, and Karel Howell of Karel The Girl Miniature.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Wells Fargo on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Wells FargoWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/wells-fargoEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Wells FargoView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/776634/How-a-Mini-Food-Creator-a-Pepper-Farming-Duo-and-Other-Iowans-Are-Accelerating-Their-Businesses]"

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for ABRYSVO™, the company’s bivalent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine, to help protect both infants through maternal immunization and older adults. ABRYSVO is indicated for:Passive protection against lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV in infants from birth through six months of age following maternal immunization during pregnancyActive immunization of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV""The approval of ABRYSVO in Europe marks significant progress in the scientific community's efforts to provide meaningful protection against RSV, a common respiratory virus that could potentially be severe and even life-threatening, especially for infants and older adults,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Head Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""Last year’s significant number of newborns, children, and adults being hospitalized across Europe demonstrated the immense need for protection against severe RSV cases. The approval of the vaccine for both older adults and infants through maternal immunization is a triumph for public health and we hope to see a tremendous impact for future seasons.""This marketing authorization follows the recent positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The authorization is valid in all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. ABRYSVO is the first licensed vaccine designed and studied explicitly for maternal immunization and now a single dose of the vaccine could be administered in the EU between weeks 24 and 36 of gestation.1 In addition, ABRYSVO has been studied in adults 60 years of age and older. The marketing authorization includes single-dose use in this population as well.1Story continuesThe EU marketing authorization for ABRYSVO is based on evidence from two Phase 3 clinical trials – RENOIR (RSV vaccine Efficacy study iN Older adults Immunized against RSV disease) and MATISSE (MATernal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy).RENOIR (NCT05035212) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a single dose of the vaccine in adults 60 years of age and older. MATISSE (NCT04424316) is a global, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of RSVpreF against LRTD and severe LRTD due to RSV in infants born to healthy individuals vaccinated during pregnancy.The efficacy and safety results of RENOIR and MATISSE were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. RENOIR is ongoing, with efficacy data being collected in the second RSV season in the study.Burden of Disease in EuropeRSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness worldwide.2 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual, potentially causing severe illness or death.3,4,5 In the EU, approximately 245,000 yearly hospital admissions were associated with RSV in children younger than five years of age, with most cases occurring among children under one year old.6 The disease burden for older adults is also significant. Each year, the virus causes more than 270,000 hospitalizations and about 20,000 deaths in individuals 60 years and older.7About ABRYSVOPfizer currently is the only company with an RSV vaccine to help protect older adults, as well as help protect infants through maternal immunization. Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved RSVpreF under the name ABRYSVO for the prevention of LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant individuals. This followed the FDA’s May 2023 approval of ABRYSVO for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. In June, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) officially recommended the vaccine for use in adults 60 years of age and older.In February 2023, Pfizer Japan announced an application was filed with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for RSVpreF as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. In April 2023, Pfizer Canada announced Health Canada accepted RSVpreF for review for both individuals ages 60 and older and as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV.Pfizer has initiated two additional clinical trials evaluating ABRYSVO. One trial is being conducted in children at higher risk for RSV disease ages two to less than 18 years.8 A second trial is evaluating adults ages 18 to 60 years at higher risk for RSV due to underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and COPD, and adults ages 18 and older who are immunocompromised and at high-risk for RSV.8 Pfizer also plans post-marketing studies and surveillance programs to further describe the safety of the vaccine.U.S. INDICATIONS FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVO is a vaccine indicated for:the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in people 60 years of age and olderpregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age for the prevention of LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of ageU.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVO should not be given to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any of its componentsFor pregnant individuals: to avoid the potential risk of preterm birth, ABRYSVO should be given during 32 through 36 weeks gestational ageFainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including ABRYSVO.

Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.6%, which is below the industry average. View our latest analysis for Fox Fox's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, Fox was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 48.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendFox Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryLooking back, the dividend has been stable, but the company hasn't been paying a dividend for very long so we can't be confident that the dividend will remain stable through all economic environments. The annual payment during the last 4 years was $0.46 in 2019, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.1% a year over that time. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. In the last five years, Fox's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 6.4% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Fox will make a great income stock. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

183,65a9c28a-70cf-35cd-8091-aea514c9e2eb,PYPL,2023-08-25,Peter Thiel launched a student newspaper 36 years ago. It has since become one of the surest paths to success in Silicon Valley,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peter-thiel-launched-student-newspaper-140000199.html,1692885600,STORY,"['PYPL', 'PLTR']","[In January 2000, a young Stanford University student named Paul Martin walked into the office of a fledgling tech company called Confinity on University Avenue in Palo Alto. He was there to see Peter Thiel about an internship.Thiel, who had yet to become a renowned founder and investor, was already a familiar face, thanks to the dinners he had hosted for staff of the Stanford Review, a conservative student newspaper on Stanford’s campus that Thiel had cofounded as an undergraduate studying philosophy. Martin, a business manager for that paper, had been struck by one dinner in particular at a steak house in Palo Alto, where he recalls Thiel discussing how China would become a substantial threat to the future of American interests, as part of a wider discussion ranging from religion to politics, economics to entertainment. “He’s just—he’s an impressive person,” Martin says. “And so if he says, ‘Hey, I’ve got this company, and I think that this has a real shot at being a huge success,’ then you’re going to [think], ‘I should probably get on board with that.’”When Martin arrived at Confinity, he was surprised to see another Review staffer already working there: Eric Jackson, who had been editor-in-chief during Martin’s freshman year. Jackson took the undergrad out to lunch after his meeting with Thiel—to a little spot down the street on University Avenue. “He [said], ‘You know, this is taking off. This is going somewhere. And if you come now, then you’re going to be a part of something special. If you wait, this might be over,’” Martin recalls.Martin dropped out of Stanford—and off the university’s track team—shortly after to start working full-time at Confinity. That company would eventually undergo a name change—to PayPal.Martin and Jackson were just two of dozens of individuals who have followed Peter Thiel on what has quietly become one of the surest paths to an enviable job in Silicon Valley. It all starts at the Stanford Review, the student newspaper Thiel founded with Norman Book, another future early PayPal employee, in 1987.Story continues“We obviously didn’t envision it becoming this incredible tech Silicon Valley network decades later when we started back in 1987,” says Thiel, who agreed to sit down for an interview with Fortune to discuss the paper. (Joining Thiel on the call was Sam Wolfe, a former editor-in-chief from 2018–19 who met Thiel via the Review and now works for him as a researcher at his hedge fund.)“We certainly were not ideologically monolithic in any way,” Thiel said in the interview. “But the fact that there were a lot of strong personal connections that, not only I had with people, but they had with one another—gave it a certain esprit de corps that helped a lot…[PayPal] certainly had a lot of volatility, a lot of ups and downs—and that kind of intense camaraderie was what was super helpful to get through the boom and the bust.”On campus, the conservative student newspaper has gained a reputation over its more than 30-year history for riling up the left-leaning Stanford community. And every once in a while, one of its impassioned and controversial opinion pieces criticizing political correctness, lambasting homosexuality, or calling out one of Stanford’s professors, has trickled into the national headlines. So did a lawsuit that was filed by Stanford students including some Review writers against the college in the ’90s, which ultimately compelled the university to overturn its speech code meant to put a stop to bigoted speech on campus. But beyond a handful of high-profile exceptions, the paper has largely remained unknown beyond Stanford’s elite campus, even if its network has grown large.Former Review editors say that Thiel has been influential in cultivating the paper’s community, well after Thiel received his undergraduate degree from Stanford in 1989. And Thiel remains involved to this day, hosting dinners for staffers for more than three decades now—at his home, or at places like the Sundance steak house in Palo Alto—where he discusses world events and political philosophy and asks students questions about college life and what ideas are circulating around campus. In 2017, there was a 30th anniversary party for Review alumni, and the Stanford Review’s current editor-in-chief, Walker Stewart, told Fortune he had attended a dinner for Review writers hosted by Thiel in just the past year.A look back through the archived mastheads of the Review shows how vast—but also how tight—the legendary investor’s orbit is. Several of PayPal’s cofounders or early executives—Thiel, Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, and former U.S. ambassador to Sweden Ken Howery—wrote for the paper, as did three founders of Palantir, a defense technology company with a market capitalization of nearly $33 billion as of mid-August. You can add Founders Fund investor Keith Rabois, who had stints at LinkedIn and Square, and Founders Fund principal John Luttig to the mix as well. Joe Lonsdale, who worked for Thiel after serving as editor-in-chief of the Review and now runs venture capital firm 8VC, has hired a number of the conservative paper’s staffers, including Alex Moore, one of Lonsdale’s longest-running investing partners, and, just last year, recent Stanford alum Maxwell Meyer. (Lonsdale married another Review editor, Tayler Cox, and Lonsdale’s brother wrote for the paper, too.)Thiel himself, who served on former President Donald Trump’s transition committee, is estimated to be worth some $9.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Collectively—across venture capital funds and tech companies—this group of alumni has control over multiples of that. Founders Fund last reported $11 billion in assets under management. Lonsdale’s 8VC oversees more than $6 billion in committed capital. Not to mention Review alums who have gone on to wield influence at tech companies across the industry, such as Facebook (now Meta), where former Review business manager Gideon Yu was CFO for two years, or OpenAI, where Review alum Bob McGrew currently serves as vice president of research.Six years ago, former Stanford student Andrew Granato spent almost a year poring through the Review’s vast network for an article in student magazine Stanford Politics—pinpointing nearly 300 Review alumni who had either worked for, or had received investments from, either Thiel or Lonsdale. And since 2018, those numbers have continued to rise. Fortune identified at least six more individuals who have gone on to intern or work at Palantir, Thiel Capital, Founders Fund, the Thiel Foundation, or Lonsdale’s venture capital fund, 8VC—as well as a handful of others who are working at companies like Rippling, which is backed by Founders Fund.Fortune spoke with 10 current or former Review editors and staffers, including Thiel, and reviewed hundreds of pages of nonprofit filings as well as an extensive network of company websites, LinkedIn pages, and archived newspaper articles to understand how the student newspaper became such a prominent, yet controversial, launchpad into the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem—and to piece together the common thread that bound them together. (Two of the people spoke with Fortune on condition of anonymity, and one asked to remain confidential in order to discuss some of the newspaper’s controversial articles.)Infographic shows links between Stanford Review alumni and Silicon Valley companies“Now that I look back at it—it’s been a big part of what I did,” said Jackson, the Review editor and early PayPal employee who would go on to set up a conservative and Christian market-focused publishing company with Review cofounder Norman Book and author a book about PayPal. Jackson says he has recruited Review alumni, pitched them for investments, and brought them on as advisors and directors at tech startups he has founded over the years.Former Review staffers say that the journal attracted a group of contrarian, free-thinking college kids some have described as outcasts who, despite being predominantly conservative or libertarian, disagreed on politics and internally debated the premise of stories published in the newspaper over the years. Decades of pages of the Review point to another shared characteristic: a belief that their worldview and the Western value system were under assault both on their university campus and across the nation. As a result, those students would repeatedly come out swinging at their ideological opponents, starting in the pages of the Review—and, in some cases, throughout their subsequent careers.The early days of the Stanford ReviewThe Stanford Review was one of a series of conservative campus newspapers that popped up across the U.S. in the ’80s. The first of its kind, the Dartmouth Review, ended up fostering conservative commentators, writers, and television personalities like Gregory Fossedal, Laura Ingraham, Dinesh D’Souza, and Joseph Rago. It’s not so surprising that, on a campus ingrained in Silicon Valley tech, the Stanford Review has cultivated so many tech investors and engineers.At the time the Review came into the picture, Thiel was a philosophy undergraduate at Stanford. And the university was undergoing an ideological transformation. There was the now-infamous march with presidential candidate the Rev. Jesse Jackson at which students chanted: “Hey hey, ho ho, Western culture’s got to go.” One year later, Stanford would replace its Western Civilization course with Culture, Ideas &amp; Values, aimed at incorporating more works written by women and people of color as well as non-European historical studies. (Thiel and David Sacks, an early PayPal executive and a founder of Craft Ventures, would later cite a series of Review articles and anecdotes in the book they wrote on the topic: The Diversity Myth.)Much of what has been published by the Review over the years revolved around campus news or foreign politics (with little on business or technology): stories on the connection between the George W. Bush administration and Stanford’s Hoover Institution; the controversy surrounding a campus-wide boycott on grapes; or why Condoleezza Rice should have been considered for the role of university president.But a key part of the Stanford Review’s initial mission was to be combative with the majority on Stanford’s largely liberal-leaning campus by presenting alternative views—and to spark “much-needed debate,” according to the first editor’s note in 1987. The methods students used to deliver those alternative views varied from thoughtful analysis and reporting to provocative—or outright offensive—opinion pieces. Max Chafkin, who authored a biography of Thiel, wrote about a “long day at the end of 2019” spent in the Stanford archives, reading through issues of the Review. “To flip through the pages…is to be continually flabbergasted that the authors managed to amass so much power in the decades that followed without suffering any apparent blowback,” he wrote in his book, The Contrarian.A 2004 story ran with the headline “Homosexuals Will Weaken Marriage.” A brazen column written by Sacks on “glory holes” in 1993 ended up featured in the New York Times. Infamous in Review history is a string of excerpts of articles written by Ryan Bounds, including one in which he likened multiculturalism efforts to a Nazi book burning, that surfaced shortly after he was nominated by President Trump for a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The White House ended up withdrawing his nomination amid the backlash.Some writers have apologized in the following decades. Sacks said at the time of the New York Times story that he was “embarrassed by some of the things I wrote in college over 20 years ago, and I am sorry I wrote them,” and that he was “horrified” by his old views on homosexuality. Bounds said he should have been more respectful and had used “overheated rhetoric.” (Sacks and Bounds didn’t return requests for comment for this article.)Thiel told Fortune he believes in “maximalist free speech—especially of the sort that has a political valence,” defending Bounds’ articles as “well within the zone of reasonable discourse.” And he came to the defense of the Review publishing some of its more controversial pieces, even “if there were specific stories I would not personally have written.”Speaking more broadly, Thiel says that the Review became “markedly less controversial” in 2002, around the same time that articles began to be published on the internet; he says that the internet has made it harder for undergraduates to explore ideas or say controversial things that they might end up changing their mind about.“A lot of articles in the 1990s—what you have to contextualize is these were pieces [written] in a context where they thought it would be read for one week in a college setting—not where it would be on the imperishable internet for decades to come,” Thiel says.Other editors who spoke with Fortune chalked up some of the more contrarian pieces to argumentative 20-year-olds who wanted to stir the pot. “If it doesn’t make waves, if people aren’t talking about it, it’s irrelevant,” says one editor, who would only speak on the topic anonymously. “That has to be understood.”Anyone who dares to read back through the Review’s archived pieces on homosexuality would be hard-pressed to miss the irony between the lines, as Thiel—and several other former editors or writers—are now openly gay. One former editor laughed when he brought it up: “I’m gay—as are about one-third of the former Review editors, it turns out,” said Jeff Giesea, who helped Thiel set up his hedge fund in the late ’90s, then later founded B2B media company FierceMarkets.To PayPal and beyondIn 2007 Fortune immortalized the descriptor “PayPal Mafia” in a story detailing how so many tech luminaries like Thiel, Elon Musk, and Reid Hoffman got their start at the payments company. But many of the company’s earliest employees likely wouldn’t have arrived at PayPal in the first place without the Review. Martin was one of them—as were Jackson, Rabois, Sacks, Aman Verjee, Nathan Linn, and Bob McGrew.Thiel hired a number of Review staffers between 1999 and 2000 when he was starting the company that became PayPal, he says, noting that he wanted to work with people he considered friends and that he bonded with on some level—particularly during the ups and downs of the period now known as the “dotcom bubble.”“There certainly wasn’t a sense that [working for Thiel] was an open invitation to anyone,” says Henry Towsner, who was editor of the Review in 2002. “There wasn’t anything formalized—or even necessarily overtly intentional” about the connections, Martin says. “It just kind of happened.”Though not for everyone. As several former editors acknowledged, while there have been many female writers and editors for the Review since its first few years in circulation, not many of them ended up in Thiel’s tech orbit—Tayler Lonsdale and Assemble cofounder Lisa Wallace, both Review editors who went on to work at Palantir, being two of the few exceptions. The Review alumni network is predominantly male, though that has, slowly, started to change over the years, with more recent Review alumnae including Antigone Xenopoulos, who interned at Palantir, or Anna Mitchell, who was an associate at 8VC and is now a recruiter at Founders Fund portfolio company Rippling.For those who did end up in the tech orbit, Thiel companies were sometimes just a launchpad. Sacks went on to run the multibillion-dollar venture capital firm Craft Ventures, which has backed Airbnb, Lyft, Palantir, and SpaceX. Verjee, who is still chairman of the Review’s affiliated nonprofit organization and mentors students, went on to become COO of early-stage VC and accelerator 500 Startups (he later set up a VC secondary fund). Bob McGrew is vice president of research at Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence juggernaut OpenAI. Giesea founded FierceMarkets, a B2B media business focused on health care. Premal Shah cofounded the microloan startup Kiva, and Jackson cofounded a crypto ownership registry called TransitNet. Lonsdale, who now runs 8VC, has cofounded companies like Addepar and OpenGov.Some of the companies or organizations Review alumni have launched or ended up working for are controversial in some way. Palantir has been contentious owing to its ties to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (a former staff writer said the controversy around Palantir made it all the more alluring to Review writers). Lonsdale is planning to set up a new university in Austin that is teaching what it calls “forbidden courses.” Rippling, a Founders Fund–backed company that has attracted Review alums, is run by Parker Conrad, a founder who had resigned from human resources company Zenefits over an insurance scandal and ultimately had to settle with the SEC. (David Sacks succeeded Conrad as temporary CEO of Zenefits. At the time of the settlement, Conrad said he was pleased to have reached an agreement with the SEC and was “incredibly proud” of what he had built at Zenefits.)One former writer notes there is a through line that clearly connects the Review bunch: A “disdain for liberal orthodoxy and identity politics—things like political correctness,” this staff writer says, adding, “They sort of see it as emblematic of a society governed by convention and not free thinkers.”  But most of the former editors who spoke with Fortune emphasized that the Review network is intellectually diverse and object to the notion that it is monolithic. As a handful of editors pointed out, some Review alumni vehemently disagree on which political candidates they support, fiscal policy, or whether they think the U.S. should support the war in Ukraine.“There is more political diversity among Review alums than people might expect. I think we’re seeing that play out right now,” says former editor Giesea.Jocelyn Mangan, founder of Him for Her, a social impact organization that specializes in boosting diversity on corporate and startup boards, argues that cognitive diversity can really only come from a network that spans race, gender, geography, age, educational background, and socioeconomic experiences—diversity most major Silicon Valley networks and early-stage companies and boards lack. Networks like those from the Review, where people go on to work with and for one another, can be insular and may not be privy to the voices or perspectives that are missing, according to Mangan. “I really think it comes down to human nature network behavior—of picking who everyone thinks is the safe answer, which is who I know,” Mangan says. “That ultimately is the riskiest answer, because it may mean that you don’t see around that corner.”The lasting impact of the ReviewIn the end, Thiel says, the Stanford Review has not been very effective in changing Stanford’s campus, one he describes as too conformist, with little room for heterodox thought. But he contends the Review was “very formative” in making people more independent in their thinking—something, he notes, in some context, would help people succeed in Silicon Valley—if not change it.To his credit, it’s Thiel’s bold swings on some rather unusual ideas that have made him a billionaire—his belief that payments would go digital, that Bitcoin would become valuable, or his $500,000 check to a Harvard sophomore building something called “Thefacebook.” (Thiel is also well known for predicting the 2008 housing market crash, though his strategy for monetizing it was not a success.)As Jackson puts it, of working at PayPal: “There was never a litmus test, and they weren’t political ones per se—it wasn’t Republican versus Democrat,” he notes. Instead, it was the thinking around letting the market work itself out, or how technology could end up functioning in people’s lives: ""That was the kind of stuff that we were all thinking and believing, and it definitely has the lineage that you can tie back to the Stanford Review,"" Jackson says.Though even as Review alums have amassed fortunes, built huge companies, and formed powerful networks, some quandaries that stumped the young editors back in college seem to still linger today. As Thiel wrote in April 1989 in his parting editor’s note: “I’ve learned a great deal as editor, but I still don’t know how one convinces people to listen.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

185,a7c2be2b-5461-3f31-a3a5-ea8c57f2957f,IBM,2023-08-25,IBM's New Analogue Chip Boosts AI Energy Efficiency,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibms-analogue-chip-boosts-ai-210000475.html,1692910800,STORY,['IBM'],"[A new breakthrough in tech may have just solved artificial intelligence’s energy problems. AI requires a massive and growing amount of energy, and is producing more and more greenhouse gas emissions as the sector continues to expand. The issue has been the subject of increasing attention and anxiety in recent months, but those worries could soon be a thing of the past thanks to a new kind of analogue computer chip developed by IBM research.The analogue chip is capable of running an AI speech recognition model 14 times more efficiently than a standard computer chip. The analogue chip is a compute-in-memory (CiM) model, which means that it’s able to performs calculation directly within its own memory instead of sending information back and forth millions of times to recall or store data in external memory chips, thereby relieving a significant bottleneck currently plaguing AI operations.“IBM’s device contains 35 million so-called phase-change memory cells – a form of CiM – that can be set to one of two states, like transistors in computer chips, but also to varying degrees between them,” New Scientist reported this week. This is a huge breakthrough for computing, as “these varied states can be used to represent the synaptic weights between artificial neurons in a neural network, a type of AI that models the way that links between neurons in human brains vary in strength when learning new information or skills, something that is traditionally stored as a digital value in computer memory.” Thanks to this innovation, the analogue chip is able to store and process weights with just a fraction of the computing effort typically required.The efficiency of these new analogue chips could not only solve AI’s energy use issue, but also its chip-use issue. Training AI programs can require an enormous amount of computer chips, with thousands sometimes used on a single project. This, too, has become an issue due to a worldwide computer chip shortage coupled with a boom in new AI ventures. In particular, AI companies are having unprecedented difficulties when trying to secure a type of chip known as a graphics processing unit, or GPU, as it has (until now) been the most efficient form of chip for AI’s processing needs. The shortage has left startups and smaller companies “scrambling” and taking “desperate measures” to secure the essential chips, a recent New York Times article reported.Story continuesThis kind of energy-saving innovation for AI can’t come fast enough. The scale of the present-day energy needs for machine learning is enormous, and growing at a breakneck pace. The sector’s energy use has grew 100-fold between 2012 and 2021, and has dramatically spiked since ChatGPT hit the market and spurred and AI gold rush. And most of that energy is derived from fossil fuels. Already, the overall carbon footprint of Artificial Intelligence is almost as large as that of Bitcoin – meaning it’s equivalent to the carbon footprint of some developed nations. “Currently, the entire IT industry is responsible for around 2 percent of global CO2 emissions,” Science Alert recently reported. But AI is on track to blow those numbers out of the water. Consulting firm Gartner projects that in a business-as-usual scenario, the AI sector alone will consume 3.5 percent of global electricity by 2030.It has been estimated that the training process for GPT-3, which later evolved into ChatGPT, required around 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity and a whopping 10,000 computer chips. To put this in perspective, that amount of energy could power about 121 homes in the United States for an entire year – and produce around 550 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the process.

Today, AI is actually changing business outlooks.""Demand for our data center platform for AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers,"" Nvidia founder &amp; CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday.""Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp, as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity.""Nvidia stock closed Thursday up 0.10% in the first trading session since its earnings report.Second quarter revenue for Nvidia totaled $13.51 billion, a 101% jump from last year and well above Wall Street's expectations for $11.04 billion.In the 1990s, companies like Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), and Intel (INTC) saw their share prices soar as exuberance mounted around the prospects for the chipmakers.The New York Times even called Cisco a ""bellwether"" for the stock market in 2000. But less than a year later, the company cited a macroeconomic slowdown as it cut jobs and profits swung to losses.Thomas Russell, then an associate professor of economics at Santa Clara University, told The Times in 2001 the slowdown at Cisco was a ""wake-up call"" for the semiconductor industry, noting the roles that Cisco played in the economy moving forward hadn't changed.Story continuesAll three stocks would fall about 80% as the dot-com bubble popped.In July, BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fundamental equities Tony DeSpirito described demand as ""really real"" at a media roundtable and said the earnings growth from AI is ""just coming.""Indicators that demand is outpacing Nvidia's supply have abounded on earnings calls this quarter.In July, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company would ""take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us.""During recent earnings calls, Big Tech giants Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also noted that Nvidia GPUs are powering some AI projects at their respective companies. Meta said generative AI is holding users on the app longer and driving additional revenue.""Although we recognize emerging competition from the large cloud service providers (i.e. captive/internal solutions) as well as other merchant semiconductor suppliers,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Toshiya Hari wrote in a research note on Thursday, ""we expect Nvidia to maintain its status as the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive moat and the urgency with which customers are developing/deploying increasingly complex AI models.""Huang estimates there are about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise software systems. Capital spend in those industries is shifting to building out accelerated computing and generative AI capabilities, he said, but that spend is about $250 billion, indicating the transition is far from over.""This is not a near-term thing,"" Huang said.

Big Tech, like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft; so are all the banks and financial institutions that invested directly; and companies using AI, like IBM and Salesforce,"" Anat Alon-Beck, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, told Yahoo Finance.Some of the big names that experts say are primed to win with Nvidia include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM), and IBM (IBM).Amazon and Microsoft are especially key as they have existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. All three companies got shoutouts towards the top of Nvidia's Wednesday earnings call.Two under-the-radar winners who also emerged in Nvidia's earnings call: Snowflake (SNOW) and VMware (VMW), both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships.A notable post-Nvidia spike was Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL): Shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report amid the company's stock hitting a high unseen since April 2022 earlier in the day. Nvidia and Google Cloud announced a partnership emphasizing AI hardware in March.Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, speaks during a press conference at Computex 2023 in Taipei on May 30, 2023. (Sam Yeh/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)Ultimately, there's no bigger winner out of Nvidia earnings than Nvidia itself — and the AI boom that's propelled the chipmaker to new heights. Though the AI hype can't last forever, with this latest earnings report, Nvidia and the hype have shown some key resilience.Story continuesThe losers and the question marksNvidia's competitors are clearly in the crosshairs: Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), and AMD (AMD) all saw their shares in the red on Thursday. AMD's seeing the steepest decline, falling as much as 8%.However, it's not curtains for non-Nvidia chipmakers, either — this is a big market and it's still early days, said Alon-Beck.""I know that they definitely compete with each other, but that Nvidia seems to be the one that won Wall Street’s affection,"" Alon-Beck said. ""They are all important, especially with what’s happening in the international arena and the tensions with China. All of them — Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm — are in talks with US officials about the China market. I don’t have a crystal ball but would think that perhaps it’s good for all of them if Nvidia continues to succeed. Yes, competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses, but there is room for all in our current market.""Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, and that could have ramifications down the line. It all looks good mid-hype cycle, but companies are going to have to work to meet the demand for AI by revamping their existing systems over time. Specifically, data centers — at the center of operations for essentially all tech companies — are in flux as the demand for Nvidia chips is re-forming how data centers will operate and grow from here.""A company may have an allocation of [AI chips], but the next critical question is whether they have the data center capacity to make it usable,"" Tom Traugott, SVP of strategy at EdgeCore Digital Infrastructure, told Yahoo Finance.

Shares have lost about 12.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is General Motors Company due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.General Motors Q2 Earnings Top EstimatesGeneral Motors reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.91 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to better-than-expected results from the North America market. The bottom line also rose from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.14 per share. Revenues of $44,746 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42,478 million and increased from $35,759 million recorded in the year-ago period.The U.S. auto giant recorded adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $3,585 million, higher than $3,072 million in the prior-year quarter. The automaker’s share in the GM market was 9.3% in the reported quarter, compared with the year-ago quarter’s 9.4%.Segmental PerformanceGM North America (GMNA) generated second-quarter net revenues of $37,220 million, up from $28,760 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2022. Also, revenues from the unit outpaced our model projection of $33,283.4 million on higher-than-expected deliveries as vehicle demand remained strong despite the high costs of borrowing. Wholesale vehicle sales in the GMNA unit totaled 833,000 units, increasing from 662,000 units reported in the year-ago quarter and topping our estimate of 738,000 units. The segment’s operating profit came in at $3,194 million, increasing from $2,299 million recorded in the year-earlier period. The metric also beat our forecast of $3,004.8 million.Story continuesGM International's (GMI) net revenues in the reported quarter came in at $3,955 million, up from the year-ago quarter’s $3,807 million. The metric, however, fell short of our estimate of $4,376 million due to lower-than-expected deliveries. The segment’s wholesale vehicle sales of 147,000 units decreased from 155,000 units in the year-ago quarter and missed our projection of 172,000 units. GMI reported an operating profit of $236 million, which rose from the year-ago profit of $209 million but lagged our estimate of $378 million. Notably, the second quarter of 2022 included $0.2 billion Momenta mark-to-market gains.GM Financial generated net revenues of $3,498 million in the quarter, up from $3,146 million recorded in the year-ago period and ahead of our prediction of $3,019 million. The segment recorded an EBIT-adjusted operating profit of $766 million, down from $1,106 million. The metric outpaced our forecast of $643 million, thanks to loan portfolio growth and higher effective yield.GM Cruise recorded net revenues of $26 million in the second quarter compared with $25 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The metric exceeded our projection by $1 million. The segment posted an operating loss of $611 million, wider than a loss of $543 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The reported loss also came in wider than our estimate of $527 million owing to higher-than-expected costs related to operational scaling.Financial PositionGeneral Motors had cash and cash equivalents of $23,074 million as of Jun 30, 2023, compared with $19,153 million as of Dec 31, 2022. The long-term automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15,976 million compared with $15,885 million as of Dec 31, 2022.General Motors’ net automotive cash provided by operating activities amounted to $7,114 million during the quarter under review.  The company recorded an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $5,548 million in second-quarter 2023, surging from $1,407 million recorded in the year-ago period.2023 Guidance UpdatedFor 2023, General Motors’ full-year net income is estimated in the band of $9.3-$10.7 billion, up from the previously guided $8.4-$9.9 billion range. The adjusted EBIT forecast was revised upward to $12-$14 billion from $11-$13 billion guided before. Adjusted EPS is expected in the band of $7.15-$8.15 a share, up from the prior forecast of $6.35-$7.35. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is envisioned between $7 billion and $9 billion, up from the previous projection of $5.5-$7.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 16.2% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, General Motors Company has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise General Motors Company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

193,45a1f84b-c98a-3e02-b56f-76808d191652,GM,2023-08-25,10 Best EV Charging Stocks According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-ev-charging-stocks-140857103.html,1692886137,STORY,"['TSLA', 'CHPT', 'WKHS', 'ABB.BO', 'GM', 'NIO', 'HMC', 'RIVN']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 10 best EV charging stocks according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the EV charging sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Best EV Charging Stocks According to Hedge Funds.Electric vehicles have been part of the automotive industry for quite a while now, with consumers, manufacturers, and governments alike arguing that these vehicles should be a significant part of the global community's future. As climate change and global warming concerns gain more traction year by year, investing in sustainable and environmentally-friendly products such as electric vehicles is becoming a top priority for many individuals and organizations.A New Group Emerges To Challenge TeslaCompanies like NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO), Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have been at the forefront of the EV race, with the third company being the major dominating force in the EV market. Elon Musk's EV manufacturing company has long held the crown among its competitors for its stellar electric vehicles and Tesla Superchargers. However, CNBC reported just this July that the reigning champion has started to face a challenge from some of its competitors in 2023. A new group has been formed of some of the most prominent EV makers in the US, with the sole aim of providing electric vehicle charging in the country. This move has been influenced both by a desire to put a stop to Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) dominance in the EV space and by an inclination to further benefit from the Biden administration's subsidies for electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging networks.The automakers part of this group include Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (ETR:BMW), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Honda Motor Company Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), Hyundai Motor Co (KRX:005380), Kia Corp (KRX:000270), Mercedes Benz Group AG (ETR:MBG), and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA). While these companies represent about half of US vehicle sales, they do not hold a large share of the electric vehicle market, which may be part of the reason why these automobile manufacturers are now making this move in the electric vehicle charging space. According to the CNBC report, the group is aiming to provide 30,000 electric vehicle chargers for which it is initially targeting major highways and cities.Story continuesAs this coalition of companies gets to work on its new project, those interested in the electric vehicle industry may begin to wonder whether or not this group will be able to chip away at Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) positions in the market by forcing it to share some of its business with its competitors. However, at present, Musk's company offers the largest network of fast chargers for electric vehicles in the US. This network consists of about 18,000 Superchargers. Considering the sheer might of Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) operations so far in this area, it might not be too easy for a new coalition such as this one to take over Musk's market share.More Updates In The EV SpaceAlongside this competitive atmosphere, automakers are also signing deals with Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to use its EV charging network and technologies in North America. CNBC reported this June that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is one of several companies that have entered into such a partnership, and it will be able to access about 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter alongside the Tesla EV charging app as a result of this partnership.The Rise of VinFast AutoOne more new development worth noting is the rise of a new company in the EV space, VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS). The Vietnamese company made its debut on the US Nasdaq Index on August 15 and has become the largest EV startup to ""soar to an outsize valuation"" right after a non-traditional stock offering, according to a Wall Street Journal article from this August. VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS) has managed to outpace older automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) because of its momentum, and on its opening day, it rose to a valuation of about $86 billion. Such developments are signifying that the EV sector is ripe for investing at the moment, with companies like these starting to reap the benefits of the public interest in EVs.Government Aims In The EV SectorRegardless of who manages to come out on top in this electric vehicle charging race, the fact remains that such active participation on the part of the companies involved in this industry can only mean good things for the US market in the long run. Additionally, it can also mean that President Biden's new EV charging stations target is that much closer to being met. The Biden administration has put forth a target of setting up 500,000 chargers for electric vehicles by 2030. Such an ambitious target would seem almost impossible to achieve. However, with major prominent automakers banding together to provide a vast network of EV chargers all across the US, this target may end up being not so far-fetched after all.Considering the above, we have compiled a list of some of the best EV charging stocks of 2023. These include some of the largest EV charging companies alongside some smaller but innovative names in the industry. Investors may do well by considering these stocks for their portfolios as we navigate through the second half of the year because of the high level of activity currently being witnessed in the sector and the drive of major automakers to make EVs and EV charging more readily accessible to consumers across the nation.10 Best EV Charging Stocks According to Hedge FundsPhoto by J Dean on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds updated as of the end of the second quarter of 2023 and picked 10 EV charging stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best EV Charging Stocks According to Hedge Funds10.

The news came a week after the legacy automaker announced that it had notified 200 engineers elsewhere about the termination of their positions.The company notified 1,029 non-union employees at the Arizona IT Innovation Center about the job cut, followed by a company-wide email.Per the email obtained by the Detroit Free Press, Stacy Lynett, vice president of Information and Digital Technology GM, wrote that the company decided to cease information and digital technology operations at the Arizona IT Innovation Center at the end of October. The move will help the company optimize its innovation center footprint and gain the efficiency and effectiveness it needs.Lynett added that all information and digital technology jobs are being eliminated at the center to streamline operations and allow GM to focus on its growth areas. Laid-off employees can apply for other openings at the company and the company will provide outplacement support. Employees who have worked for at least one year will be eligible for a severance package.Kevin Kelly, spokesperson GM, confirmed the job cuts and stated that some employees who work on vehicle software will be retained, while the company will let go of the rest of the 940 employees. He said that the purpose of closure is not cost-cutting but rather to streamline efficiencies.Kelly said General Motors is rationalizing the number of IT innovation centers it has in the country. The company decided to retain 3 of the IT innovation centers. But, due to some redundancies in efficiency, the company decided to remove one of the centers.Per General Motors’ website, The Arizona center, located in Chandler, which opened in 2014, supports the company’s IT needs, including web technologies, end-user applications, dealer and factory systems and vehicle technology.Other IT centers of the company are located in Warren, Michigan; Austin, Texas and suburban Atlanta.Per Lynett’s email, General Motors will be formulating a plan to transition some of the work done at the Arizona IT Center to other centers.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksGM currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked players in the auto space are Oshkosh Corporation OSK, Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.

Across industries and demographics, seven in 10 employees say they experience stress related to their personal finances, and, although they report feeling secure in their jobs, 63% of respondents are living paycheck to paycheck. Inflation is also a key factor contributing to employee stress, with 90% of those surveyed saying that they are negatively affected by inflation, and that their ability to set aside money for savings and cover basic necessities has been significantly impacted.Employee financial stress also affects productivity at work. In addition to 87% of surveyed employees admitting to worrying about personal finances on the job, 43% say they believe this affects their work productivity, with employees reporting to spend over 150 hours on average annually worrying about their finances. What's more, 75% of employer respondents say their employees' financial stress negatively affects business.""It's clear that both employers and employees are seeing and feeling the repercussions of financial stress,"" said Kaley Keeley Buchanan, senior vice president and head of PNC Organizational Financial Wellness. ""We believe these survey findings offer business leaders important insights that point to the value of investing in employee financial wellness benefits that could help to balance the needs of their workforce with the financial realities of their businesses.""Story continuesAlthough, 96% of employers surveyed believe that their ability to offer financial wellness benefits improves employee retention and the vast majority of employees agree, with 80% reporting that those types of benefit offerings may make them want to stay with their current employer, less than 15% reported to have access to financial education and counseling tools.Other findings in the survey include:Employers should consider offering financial wellness benefits like a free session with a financial advisor to help meet employees' needs. While the majority (eight in 10) of employers believe their employees are at least somewhat financially prepared for the future, only half of employees say they feel prepared. When asked specifically about retirement, 64% of employees say they are concerned they won't have enough money for retirement and 78% are worried they won't be able to retire when they want to. Further, 78% of employees surveyed say they haven't worked with a financial planner in the last three years.There is an opportunity for more employers to offer matching contributions. Eighty-six percent of employees surveyed say they would value retirement fund matching, but only 59% of employers consider retirement matching a must-have benefit. That said, 47% of employers who don't currently offer retirement matching say they would consider adding it to their existing programs.Emergency savings accounts top the list among benefits employees would value. Seventy-four percent of employees surveyed say they would value having an emergency savings account as a benefit, yet only 5% say they currently have access to one through their workplace. Although employers expressed interest in providing emergency savings accounts for their employees, 72% of surveyed employers admitted they don't offer them yet.Employers recognize responsibility for offering quality financial wellness benefits, despite feeling financial pressure. Ninety-four percent of employers surveyed believe they are responsible for offering their employees financial wellness benefits, but 75% of those surveyed are concerned about the potential for a recession in the near future impacting their ability to do so.""These findings clearly underscore that both employers and employees are concerned about money, inflation, and potential recession – but the two groups are not always aligned on benefits-related priorities,"" said Buchanan. ""PNC's goal is to provide our clients with industry insights, tailored solutions, and customizable programs to help them, as employers, improve overall employee financial wellness and create a more productive and confident workforce.""More findings, including the complete report and related information are available at pnc.com/WorkplaceReport.PNC Bank, National Association, is a member of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

However, its third quarter earnings forecast fell shy of expectations, with the company expecting to earn $0.94-$1.09 per share in the current quarter, below the $1.29 Wall Street was expecting.Revenue for the second quarter of $7.32 billion grew more than 8% compared to a year ago and came in above estimates of $7.21 billion.An unfavorable sales mix as customers continue to spend more on lower-margin perishables is also impacting Dollar Tree's bottom line. ""You see across the retail landscape, people are moving more into consumables and we're not immune to that,"" said Davis.""We are now taking a very defensive approach to shrink,"" Rick Dreiling, CEO of Dollar Tree, said during the earnings call. ""I do not see any trouble to getting to more realistic margin levels.""In response, the company plans to introduce anti-theft initiatives including moving certain items behind the checkout stand and removing some SKUs altogether.Household products made by Procter &amp; Gamble Co. are seen on shelves at a Dollar Tree in Newburgh, New York, May 14, 2023.

Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick joins the Live show to discuss the state of the consumer, unemployment rate, student loan payments, and the effect on the economy.Sosnick said, ""People have jobs. The unemployment rate is flirting with record lows. Those who want a job have one. And when people have jobs, they can and do spend money. But I think people are getting a bit more nervous, they are a bit more cautious.""Video Transcript- And as we wrap up the big retail results for this earnings season, we have to look back at the trends and what they tell us about the consumer. When you look at the same store sales growth for the quarter of a lot of retailers, they saw declines with just a few posting some gains.Some received praise for their results just because their declines weren't as bad as investors thought they would be of the companies that did see year over year sales growth. And here were some interesting ones-- Abercrombie and Fitch shocking the markets. They saw a huge bump up about 13%.Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Dorsey spoke with the retailer's CEO Fran Horowitz about this.FRAN HOROWITZ: Yeah, so I would say the team consumer is definitely more pressured. That's what we started to see last year and still seeing it today. But the consumer is shopping, and they're going to continue to shop. They're just making choices on who they're shopping with, and they're choosing our brand.- So we've seen that consumers continue to spend just not on big ticket items. We saw it in retail sales last week, which surprised everyone with how much people are shopping. So let's bring back in Steve Sosnick, Interactive Brokers chief strategist. They're still shopping, but they're being a little bit more picky or choosy about where they're placing value in their purchases right now clearly.Story continuesSTEVE SOSNICK: Perfect way to lead into that. Yes, it's exactly what I think we're seeing. Remember, the consumer is still 2/3 of the economy. And so we really have to be concerned with what consumers are doing. But people have jobs, right? The unemployment rate is flirting with record lows. And so those who want a job have one. And when people have jobs, they can and do spend money.But I think people are getting a bit more nervous. They're a bit more cautious. You know, remember, call it a third of the country is-- sorry-- dealing with energy bills that they've never had to deal with before. That's got to come from someplace. You know, a huge segment of the population is going to have to start paying their student loan payments again, which that money's got to come from someplace. And so as a result, I think consumers have the money to spend.They are spending, but they're being very selective. And I think also, there's a very big value proposition in where they're spending it. You saw Walmart same store sales increase. TJ Maxx same store sales increase kind of at the expense of Target, which was better than feared but still down.And Abercrombie, you know, was a big winner. I'm too old and too heavy to shop there. But the footwear stocks got-- people-- the younger consumer with a little money in his or her pocket is going Abercrombie. They're not going to Foot Locker. They're not buying Nike's this time around. Fashion moves in cycles.And I do-- so I do think what we're seeing is caution. Not concern, but some of the-- but we did really punish some of the losers, the broad line-- a lot of the broad line retailers when you think about Macy's and I know Brian Sozzi's favorite Kohl's.- How do we bring all this back to the inflation picture? Because you think about the retail, the overall retail sales number that we got 2 weeks ago now was a blowout, then you have all these really choppy retail numbers.You would think with the hot retail sales number, that would have negative implications for inflation in terms of not allowing it to abate as much. But of course as always, it's murkier now that we've got all the individual ones. So how do we factor all that in?STEVE SOSNICK: I think this is the kind of thing that Powell is going to allude to tomorrow is that the consumer is healthy. They're spending their money. It does allow some certain segments to pass along price increases, which does fuel inflation. And so the cautious consumer-- a cautious consumer doesn't mean the consumer has gone away. It just means that they've changed the mix of their spending, and they're trying to spend it more on staples.But we really haven't heard from, let's say, the consumer goods companies saying that they're cutting prices. They may not have-- this quarter, they may not have passed along as many price increases that they did the prior quarter. But you didn't hear of anybody saying, demand stinks, we're going to have to start cutting. And so until or unless that happens or until or unless they say we cannot raise prices, you have to assume that they at least, will try until it's proven otherwise.]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this retailer have returned -8.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.1% change. The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, to which Target belongs, has lost 1.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Target is expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share, indicating a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -26.9% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.6%. This estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.16 indicates a change of +20.2% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Target, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $107.39 billion and $108.31 billion estimates indicate -1.6% and +0.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $24.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.9%. EPS of $1.80 for the same period compares with $0.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.91%. The EPS surprise was +27.66%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

202,8cdc1163-fedd-3fb4-bce5-f61121dbc461,CSX,2023-08-25,Rail union calls for more extensive conductors training following 2 deaths,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rail-union-calls-more-extensive-140256359.html,1692885776,STORY,['CSX'],"[SMART-TD is calling for the railroads to beef up training after two recent fatalities involving conductor trainees. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Following two recent deaths involving conductor trainees, the union representing train conductors is calling for more stringent training than what’s being offered now at the freight railroads, according to an internal safety advisory produced by the union.The call for action by the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Railroad and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) was spurred by the two deaths of conductor trainees that occurred within 60 days of each other this summer. Both fatalities happened at Eastern U.S. Class I railroad CSX (NASDAQ: CSX).“Our trainees are dying. I appreciate the [Federal Railroad Administration] putting out a list of recommended fixes to this problem in their Safety Bulletin, but suggestions aren’t going to keep my people alive. It is time for actions and time for enforcement against these unsafe practices,” SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson said in a Wednesday release. Ferguson was referring to a safety bulletin that the FRA put out on Aug. 16 in response to the recent trainee fatalities as well as to subsequent reports involving other trainees.CSX, the National Transportation Safety Board and others are still looking into what caused the incidents, but the Aug. 16 FRA safety bulletin suggests that at least one of the incidents occurred when a conductor trainee was crushed between a rail car and locomotive during a shoving movement at a rail yard.The union said it created its own internal advisory to promote dialogue between conductors and their trainees.“Training in the railroad industry is being rushed. As trainees, you are not being properly exposed (while in a controlled environment) to the hazards you will encounter once in the field. And to the contrary, conductors have no knowledge of your experience nor the progression of your training timeline. As such, we all need to work together to overcome the shortfalls of the carrier’s training programs,” SMART-TD’s safety advisory said.Story continuesAccording to SMART-TD, FRA’s safety bulletin calls upon railroad companies to identify areas where conductors might be at risk of coming into contact with buildings, equipment of rail cars and locomotives on adjacent tracks; ensure they are providing adequate training to those charged with overseeing conductor trainees; and determine what level of experience a conductor should have to qualify as an instructor.Following the fatalities, CSX called conductor trainees back to their home terminals for additional training.Prior to the second fatality that occurred at a rail yard in Cumberland, Maryland, on Aug. 7, CSX and SMART-TD had announced on July 31 that they would be working together to enhance the conductor trainee program at CSX by adding an extra week to the program.“While some railroads are making positive changes, the fact is more needs to be done. We will continue to work diligently to see that appropriate action is taken and adequate change is made to demand and require a training program that is robust and sufficient enough to ensure the safest course. Until then, safety is on us,” said SMART-TD’s safety advisory.According to SMART-TD’s advisory, the deficiencies in the conductor trainee programs stem from how the programs are set up. Trainees may be paired with conductors who themselves have less than a year of experience in the field, it said.There is also a lack of consistency in the on-the-job training process, SMART-TD said.“Because there is no meaningful communication between conductors that have been assigned a trainee, there is no record or consideration of tasks experienced by the trainee while training in the field. This equates to no record of repetition or experience when it comes to the in-the-field experiences the trainee has been exposed to. The result is the unfortunate inability to reinforce areas of needed focus and/or introduction to practices that may not otherwise be available on other job assignments,” SMART-TD’s safety advisory said.SMART-TD’s advisory also strongly encouraged conductors and trainees to stop a task or a movement if a conductor or trainee feels that safety might be in jeopardy.The union said the deficiencies in current training programs are an effect of precision scheduled railroading, an operational method that the Class I railroads deployed to streamline operations and cut costs.“I’ve got two conductor trainees, both in the same state working for the same carrier whose lives have been cut short. The current condition of all railroad training programs is clearly in need of scrutiny. SMART-TD is not prepared to lose more of our men and women while we sit around and wait for a palatable solution,” Ferguson said.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:CSX plans extra training after deaths of 2 conductor traineesCSX and SMART-TD work on conductor trainee programUnion group wants Class I railroads to back anonymous tip hotlineThe post Rail union calls for more extensive conductors training following 2 deaths appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

MBUU is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 29, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings and net sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.3% and 8.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the top line increased 9% but the bottom line inched down 0.8% year over year.Malibu Boats’ earnings topped the consensus mark in all four trailing quarters, the average surprise being 7.2%.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 earnings per share has remained unchanged at $2.33 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 4.1% decline from the prior-year quarter’s reported value.Malibu Boats, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMalibu Boats, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMalibu Boats, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Malibu Boats, Inc. QuoteFor net sales, the consensus mark is pegged at $328.1 million, suggesting a decline of 7.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Key Factors to ConsiderMalibu Boats’ net sales of fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 are likely to have been impacted by the weak performance of the Malibu segment, which is expected to have been due to lower unit volumes and increased dealer flooring program costs. Also, revenue growth from Cobalt and Saltwater Fishing segments are expected to decline. This decline can be attributed to reduced demand as the prime selling season is coming down with inventory becoming more normalized. Moreover, given the risky microenvironment, the consumers are also cautious toward discretionary spending.For the to-be-reported quarter, the consensus estimate for Malibu and Cobal segments net sales is pegged at $147 million and $72 million, down 16.9% and 9.9%, respectively, year over year.Meanwhile, the company’s margins are likely to have been affected by increased operating expenses, given the ongoing inflationary environment. The increase is most likely to have been driven by increased selling and marketing as well as general and administrative expenses.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Malibu Boats this time around.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this cruise operator have returned +1.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.1% change. The Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, to which Royal Caribbean belongs, has lost 5.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $3.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1,192.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +19.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +180.3%. This estimate has changed +31.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.16 indicates a change of +35.5% from what Royal Caribbean is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +17.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Royal Caribbean is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Royal Caribbean, the consensus sales estimate of $3.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +33.3%. The $13.66 billion and $15.42 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +54.5% and +12.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryRoyal Caribbean reported revenues of $3.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.3%. EPS of $1.82 for the same period compares with -$2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.28%. The EPS surprise was +15.19%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Royal Caribbean is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

206,22cac5f4-da29-33d4-a7ca-8f15135589cf,ROST,2023-08-25,"Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ross-stores-inc-rost-hit-131503520.html,1692882903,STORY,"['ROST', 'TJX']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Ross Stores (ROST)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $122.7 in the previous session. Ross Stores has gained 5% since the start of the year compared to the 16.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 4.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 17, 2023, Ross Stores reported EPS of $1.32 versus consensus estimate of $1.17.For the current fiscal year, Ross Stores is expected to post earnings of $5.19 per share on $19.94 billion in revenues. This represents a 18.49% change in EPS on a 6.66% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $5.71 per share on $20.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.03% and 4.78%, respectively.Valuation MetricsRoss Stores may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Ross Stores has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 23.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 22X versus its peer group's average of 17.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.03. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Ross Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Ross Stores fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Ross Stores shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does ROST Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of ROST have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX). TJX has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. The TJX Companies, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 11.84%, and for the current fiscal year, TJX is expected to post earnings of $3.69 per share on revenue of $53.61 billion.Shares of The TJX Companies, Inc. have gained 3% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 24.36X and a P/CF of 21.26X.The Retail - Discount Stores industry is in the top 24% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for ROST and TJX, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reported EPS is $2.49 EPS, expectations were $2.53.Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&amp;A. Sir, the floor is yours.Michael Lucarelli: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release, and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC.

We are comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?Vincent Roche: Thank you, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. ADI executed well in the third quarter and delivered results within our expectations despite the challenging operating environment. Revenue was nearly $3.1 billion, led by growth in our Industrial and Automotive markets once again. Gross margin remained strong, above 72%, operating margin was nearly 48% and EPS was $249 million. This continued profitability reflects our portfolio's resilience as well as the innovation premium that it commands. I want to turn to the current business environment now just for a moment. As we shared last quarter, we believe we're in a period of customer inventory reconciliation following three consecutive years of steady growth.Story continuesThrough our customer conversations, it's evident these accelerating inventory adjustments relate to the weakening macro backdrop and ADI's rapidly improving lead times. Importantly, we believe we shipped below end market consumption in the third quarter and expect to do so again in the fourth. This will help normalize our customers' inventory more quickly and position us to return to growth more quickly in the coming quarters. Stepping back, while near-term dynamics or turbulence, our long-term confidence remains undiminished. Over the last several decades, we have enhanced the resiliency of our global business, defined by our diversified customer and product portfolio and flexible hybrid manufacturing model. This enables us to ensure softer demand periods while sustaining strategic investments to ensure that we capitalize on the upside when the business inflects.It's these characteristics and our alignment to numerous concurrent secular growth trends that give us confidence that ADI will deliver on our long-term model of 7% to 10% revenue CAGR. Now one area underpinning this growth outlook are the applications tied to sustainable use cases, which currently represents about 1/3 of our total revenue. And today, I want to unpack a vital part of this, the evolving electrification ecosystem that is driving growth in our industrial and automotive markets. As the world marches to net 0, we need to eliminate 51 gigatons of global greenhouse gases emitted every year. Fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor accounting for more than 75% of all emissions. And at the same time, global energy consumption is forecasted to increase by 50% by 2050.A major unnecessary energy transition is underway and an upgraded and expanded energy grid is foundational to support a decarbonization pathway. Making the shift through renewable energy sources in both commercial and residential infrastructure as well as electric vehicles and global transportation will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These moves also create new challenges in the generation distribution, consumption and smoothing of energy supply. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of this electrification journey from upgrading the grid infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. The common thread woven through all these applications is the high-performance precision signal processing, control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities in which ADI excels.Now today, I'll bring the story to life at the application level, starting with grid infrastructure. Overall, today's electrical grid is undergoing modernization to meet current and future demands. Historically, traditional energy sources like coal, oil and gas were centralized and distributed in one direction from the grid to the consumer. Today, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are more distributed necessitating a dynamic bidirectional flow of energy. To achieve this, the grid must be able to adjust performance across the network in real time, which requires an exponential increase in monitoring and storage capabilities. And for example, our collaboration with the Enel Group provides smart meters and grid digitalization solutions for distribution system operators.Here, ADI's control and sensing technologies are enabling high-performance, precision monitoring and data creation at the heart of the digital substation. And we're leveraging our mixed-signal digital and algorithm technologies to enable greater intelligence at the grid's edge. Now moving to energy storage systems, which are critical to mitigate intermittency issues across the network. ADI is a leader with our technologies used in 60% of energy storage systems across residential, commercial and grid scale networks. Leveraging our battery management system technology or BMS. We're increasing capacity and improving energy utilization in energy storage systems, which maximizes the battery's lifetime value. These monitoring and storage challenges extend to the grid's edge as well, including EV charging stations, ADI's energy metrology, isolation and sensing technologies, help enable a broader range of applications in AC and DC charging equipment.In addition to these important applications in our highly diverse industrial segment, our high-performance signal processing platforms and domain expertise are helping to electrify the automotive market. Here, our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles by increasing range and lowering cost. And I'll start with BMS. As we've shared before, we are the leader in this area with our BMS solution designed into 16 of the top 20 EV manufacturers. We're currently sampling our eighth generation solution, which utilizes software and algorithms to enable physical measurement capabilities all the way into the battery cell. These advances in edge processing change the game in how the internal battery health is managed, supporting faster charging and better range prediction.An extension of this is our wireless BMS solution, a first in the industry. It has all the benefits of our wired solution and enables a scalable battery architecture, with quicker and more cost-effective production cycles. Currently, our wireless BMS is designed in at four OEMs, and we expect another large OEM to adopt it in the coming quarters. Given this momentum and the cutting-edge value proposition, we believe the wireless platform will represent a large portion of our BMS revenue by the end of the decade. And looking ahead, we're broadening our EV capabilities beyond battery management and storage to power conversion solutions. Specifically, we're developing a silicon carbide-based smart switch for bidirectional onboard charging that significantly reduces charger size and weight by over 50%, thus driving down cost.Notably, this intelligent integrated switch enables the EV to transfer energy back into the network, creating a more reliable grid. And this innovation solution more than doubles our content opportunity per EV powertrain. So in summary, ADI is driven by a deep sense of purpose and a desire for our innovations to positively impact all stakeholders. We're immensely proud of the role our technologies play to improve the well-being of humanity and indeed the planet, and I remain very confident in our future. Our portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, world-class talent base are aligned with an unprecedented number of attractive secular trends, where the semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx is increasing tremendously. This presents ADI with continued profitable growth opportunities as well as the ability to shape the future of industries.And so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.Photo by Christian Wiediger on UnsplashPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. While demand continued to soften throughout the quarter, ADI delivered nearly $3.1 billion revenue, in line with our guidance. This was driven by continued year-over-year growth for both Industrial and Automotive. Looking at our performance by end market. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue, finished down 7% sequentially after a tremendous stretch of 13 straight quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% with most applications up, led by sustainable energy as well as aerospace and defense, which each grew double digits.Automotive, which represented 24% of revenue, was down modestly sequentially in line with our expectations. Year-over-year growth of 15% was broad-based. We saw continued outsized growth for ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which collectively increased nearly 30% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, decreased double digits, both sequentially and year-over-year due to the broad-based inventory correction we flagged previously. And lastly, consumer, which represented 10% of revenue came in stronger than expected, finishing up 15% sequentially, but down 21% year-over-year. We remain optimistic that our second quarter marked the bottom for this business despite the ongoing inventory correction.And now on to the rest of the P&amp;L. Gross margin of 72.2% remains industry-leading, but declined sequentially due to lower utilization and product mix. Operating expenses of $752 million were roughly flat year-over-year and up sequentially. This quarter's OpEx reflects the full impact of annual merit increases. Operating margin of 47.8% contracted 230 basis points year-over-year, roughly in line with the gross margin decline. Non-op expenses were $57 million, and our tax rate was 11.2%. All told, EPS came in at $2.49 within our guidance range. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Given the revenue pressures and our decision to hold more finished goods versus restocking the channel, inventory dollars increased and the days of inventory moved higher to 179.As a result, channel inventory remains below our target level and slightly declined. Specifically, we strategically undershipped Asia, especially China, due to weaker demand trends. CapEx was $325 million for the quarter as we invest to enhance ADI's global resiliency and offer our customers options on where their products are sourced. 2023 should represent the high watermark for CapEx, and we expect it to decline in 2024. Importantly, our investments do not include the benefits of tax credit and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and the European Chips Act. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 29% of revenue. And over the same period, we've returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders or over 130% of free cash flow via more than $3.3 billion in buybacks and more than $1.6 billion in dividends.Now turning to the Q4 guidance. We expect the fourth quarter revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus $100 million. This outlook assumes sell-in to be below sell-through. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect all markets to be down sequentially given the broad-based inventory correction. On a relative basis, Auto and Consumer should perform a bit better than Industrial and Comms. Operating margin is expected to be 44% plus or minus 70 basis points. This margin outlook embeds planned utilization reductions and a decline in OpEx. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2 plus or minus $0.10. As our outlook is lower than expected, let me provide some context on what we're experiencing and how we will navigate.Our revenue outlook reflects the broad-based macro softness across all end markets, all geographies and customers both large and small. We are also strategically improving lead times to get a better view into demand and enhance customer satisfaction. Today, we're shipping over 85% of our products within 13 weeks, and this is up from 35% a year ago. As Vince mentioned, we are seeing customers accelerate inventory adjustments due to both the softer environment and our lead time improvements. And as such, we're taking measures to preserve the integrity of our balance sheet, cash flow and income statement. This includes further reducing utilization and lowering external wafer purchases with a goal to decrease inventory meaningfully in the coming quarters.And importantly, as we've outlined before, we expect gross margins will maintain a 70% level on a trailing 12-month basis. This gross margin resiliency is a testament to the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model and our unique swing capacity capability. In addition to the naturally lower variable comp, we're also taking steps to reduce total OpEx by roughly $50 million sequentially. So stepping back, we're not ready to call the bottom yet but our history shows that we cycle up quickly. And when we do, we will achieve higher highs. ADI has built a very resilient business, rich with opportunities. Our diversification and exposure to numerous secular trends drives our durable earnings stream and solid free cash flow, enabling us to consistently return capital to shareholders.And to that end, over the trailing 12 months, we've returned $5 billion to shareholders or more than 5% of our market cap. As this is my last ADI earnings call, I'd like to give a quick thank you to Vince for his mentorship and counsel over the past six years to the ADI Board, including our audit chair, Karen Golz, for their unwavering support and most importantly, to the world-class finance staff, including young Mike here for always reminding us of our commitments to you, the company's owners. I look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks as we get on the road. Mike, let's go to Q&amp;A.Michael Lucarelli: Thanks, Prashanth. I don't think I've been called young in some time, but I appreciate that. Now let's get to our Q&amp;A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, can be our first question, please.See also 15 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds and 30 Countries with Longest Life Expectancy in 2023.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.Tore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. I have a question for Vince. So I know you're not ready to call a bottom. But some industry observers would say that this sort of inventory build started maybe late 2021, early 2022 based on your guidance for the October quarter, you're sort of back to that level. So then you've seen these cycles, you've seen many of them. They're all different. But just wanted to get a sense for you what you think we're getting close, especially given what I just said about that inventory adjustment now sort of being complete?Vincent Roche: Yes. Thanks, Tore. When I look at this current cycle, the symptoms are always the same in these cycles, but the causes tend to have different components. And I think right now, there are two kind of inputs to this particular correction. I think one is the inventory in digestion that exists out there that has been building for 18, 24 months now. And the second, of course, is the macroeconomic situation, which is a major governor as well. But I think if you look at what we understand from the direct side of our business, for example, when we look at our largest customers revenue growth and their forecast compared to our growth at these very same customers, we believe that we've been shipping the low-end consumption in the third and will in the fourth quarter.So I think one way to look at this is how long will the inventory correction take? My sense is it will be two to three quarters before we get through the inventory digestion cycle, and I think we're positioned as a company to get beyond it quite fast because we've been managing our factories very carefully, managing our inventories, both on our own balance sheet as well as our distribution channel. So we've also, I think, taken a long-term view to the demand patterns of our customers. We haven't, in any way, forced them into, for example, long-term supply agreements, essentially, at this point in the cycle, that will be forcing them to take products that they don't really need. We've been managing our channel aggressively. So as I said, we're keeping more inventory on our own balance sheet.So again, we will get to distribute the supply ultimately where we think it's needed when the recovery gets underway here. So that's my sense, sorry. I mean, in the industry, if you look back to the dot com cycle, you look at the 2008 financial crisis cycle, most of the downturns tended to last three to four quarters. So my sense is over the next two, three quarters, we begin to see a recovery here, at least on the inventory side. And then it's really a question of how does the macro-economy perform?Tore Svanberg: Great perspective. Thank you.Michael Lucarelli: Thanks Tori. Next question, please.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.Vivek Arya: Thanks Dan. Best wishes again to Prashanth on his next adventure. You said that you're not ready to call the bottom yet and Vince, you mentioned that the inventory digestion period could last for some more time. How should we think about Q1 seasonality? It tends to be down kind of mid-single digit. Do you think we should be prepared for something different than that? Right? And if it is worse than kind of mid-single digit, do you still think that ADI can maintain gross margins above 70%. So just kind of puts and takes to help us align our models would be very useful.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Why don't I take that, Vivek. So first, quick comments just to make sure everyone has the Q4 guide, correct. So on the channel, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are shipping in below the forecast we have from our channel partners. So we are intentionally bringing channel inventories down to help set us up for some better strength. The -- included in the guide is the backlog coverage has some turns, but less than normal given the higher level of uncertainty. So we would need some more turns and positive book-to-bill, which Vince mentioned is likely to be a quarter or two out. And then just from an end market standpoint, we've got all end markets down quarter-over-quarter. So as you know, we don't guide out further than the current quarter, but some color is I think you essentially have it right.There's no reason to think that first quarter would not be down seasonal on a, which would call it, mid-single digit quarter-over-quarter. But that we -- our view is going to be driven by the holidays and the customer decisions to reduce inventory as they go into the year-end. So we're not, at this point, seeing a more meaningful step down in Q1 based on what we can know today. And I will just remember to plant and everyone as you start to model out Q1 that every once in a couple of years, we have a 14-week quarter, and that will be Q1 of '24. And then on gross margins, I think we're actually quite proud of our gross margin story here that we've been -- we've messaged a number of times that we would have the ability to maintain a 70% gross margin in a -- on a trailing 12-month basis with a peak to trough decline of 15%.Q4 is down about 17% from the Q2 peak. And while we didn't give you a gross margin number, if you impute it from the OpEx math that I gave you, you'll see that we are able to hold that north of 70%, and we'll continue to work that. For Q1, gross margins, my best sense now would be that we are likely to face a little more challenge on the utilization level as we bring inventory levels down, but we have been very successful in activating our swing capacity. We're actually doing about 10% better on utilizations because we have swing than if we hadn't activated it. So it's been a very powerful lever for us. And we need to see how the math on all of that works out for Q1, but I wouldn't expect Q1 to be notably different from kind of where we are for Q4.Vincent Roche: Yes. I'd like to add one other comment, Vivek, to what Prashanth has said. So the other side of margin is pricing, and pricing is very stable. It's very, very stable, resilient. I don't expect that to change. And our products are very, very sticky. We've got tremendous life cycles and that part of our business, this is really a unit correction in the business rather than price or share.Vivek Arya: Thanks for that. Helpful.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open.Ambrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. This is old Ambrish, Young Mike, can feel free to chime in. I was looking at the year-over-year comms, and I look at TI as your closest peer rival competitor. Vince, they started going into a year-over-year decline in 4Q '22 and you are just starting, and you said two to three quarters. So in the past history does suggest that usually on a year-over-year basis, we see roughly around four to five quarters of year decline. Is that the right way to think about your business? You said two to three quarters of digestion and I'm assuming that means year-over-year decline in reps, right?Vincent Roche: Yes. Good question, Ambrish. So yes, look, I mean, Comms is just a piece of ADI's overall story. We've actually seen -- I mean, we have two components as well. We've got wire line, we have wireless. I would say on the wire line side of things, we've seen the malaise going back into the late part of '22, early part of '23. So that's really things like optical control for data center and carrier networks, and power. We've got a power business there as well. So we think we'll see that, we expect to see CapEx somewhat recover in that space to be able to catch up with the needs, for example, driven by the explosion in computing power that's required to handle the AI inflection here, for example. So -- my sense is the wire line part will probably start its recovery in the first -- second quarter of the year.Wireless is a little harder to call. It's very, very dynamic. We all know that. The developed countries, particularly North America, 5G deployments, which have really been focused on coverage rather than capacity. They're going to be weaker than we thought. So that's probably going to give us headwinds for how long, we don't know, but I think it could be several quarters during our FY '24. India has been very strong this year, of course. And I think we're expecting to see more commitments to lay in both coverage and capacity in India during our FY '24. So look, we've got leadership in many of these areas, like optical control systems, 5G, software-defined solutions. It's really a question of timing in my mind. But -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the communications market in totality and particularly in wireless at this point.So hopefully, that gives you the answer to your question.Ambrish Srivastava: Well, I was asking about the overall business, Vince, not just about the Comms, sorry.Vincent Roche: Okay. yes. Look, I think, Ambrish, the overall business. We see some trends, for example, that will transcend the inventory digestion problem. And even the macro-economy areas like digital healthcare, like aerospace and defense, the sustainable energy theme that we spoke to a little while ago. So again, I will just reiterate my sense is the inventory digestion problem will last probably two, three quarters, and then we'll get back into a unit volume increase from there on.Ambrish Srivastava: Thank you.Vincent Roche: Thanks Ambrish.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys, thanks so much for taking my question. Prashanth, I don't want to be pedantic on Q1, but I know you said right now, down seasonal, but also as an extra week. That extra week, if I just linearize it is like a plus 7. So do those cancel out? Or is it like it's the week between Christmas and New Year, so it's not a lot of revenue? Or just how do I think about the balance of those two things into Q1, assuming a Q1 that was...Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: So when I gave you my comments of down seasonal that was on a 13-week basis, the 14-week was just a reminder as you model it. So Mike, do you want to do the math, but I think you're essentially thinking about it right.Michael Lucarelli: Yes. So as Prashanth said, let's take a first 13-week quarter. What happens normally in 1Q and a 13-week quarter our business is down, call it, 5%, plus or minus, total business. Now with an extra week, that adds about 7.5%, both on the revenue side and the OpEx side. So there's two pieces, normal, down 5% total company, in the 14-week quarter, you can add 7.5% of revenue and OpEx. That's the best way to think about it.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And thank you for clarifying that, Stacy, I wasn't clear in my answer.Stacy Rasgon: Okay. And then that would drop off into Q2, though, you go the other way in Q2. So Q2 under like normal circumstances would be worse than seasonal because you have that extra week drop off?Michael Lucarelli: Yes. So again, you can parse it in normal times, 2Q is up, call it, 2% to 5% and a 13-week to 13-week quarter, if you take away an extra week, yes, you have a 7.5% headwind. They have got 1Q.Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I have another one, but I guess I don't want to get that band next time, so I....Michael Lucarelli: I'll allow another question because that's a good clarifying question, Stacy.Stacy Rasgon: Okay. I just wanted to ask about OpEx into next year. So it sounds like you're guiding it to about $700 million in the Q4. How do I think about it next year into a revenue year that's likely to be down potentially reasonably materially. Like how should we think about OpEx just year-over-year for fiscal '24 versus '23?Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I think, Stacy, as we've always said, we run this business for the long term. So we're going to make the adjustments that are prudent to make on the discretionary side, adjusting the variable comp and where we can, but the value of this company comes from its innovation. So I wouldn't expect meaningfully more attack on the spending into 2024. But remember that our variable comp is designed to be highly accordion. So if '24 plays out as a down year, you will see that meaningfully unwind for us. Anything else...Stacy Rasgon: Is that $700 million runway Mike, is that like the right run rate to think about?Michael Lucarelli: That's not a crazy level to think about for the year. I think if you take a step back and look at kind of what we're trying to manage within our control. We talked about gross margin maintaining at 70% a trailing 12-month basis. So for the full year, I think we can do 70% gross margins, and our goal is to maintain our operating margins within our long-term target and the low end of that account 42% to 45%. So that's kind of some guardrails we think about as you're modeling out next year and what would be a down year for revenue.Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.Michael Lucarelli: Thanks Stacy.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open.Chris Danely: Hi. Thanks guys. Congrats Prashanth on retirement. I wish I was joining you. I just had a question on the Auto end market. So you're saying that you expect it to do, I guess, better relatively than Industrial. Given how much inventory has been built there, and the upcoming UAW strike, do you think it's possible that Auto could get materially worse? Are you baking that into any kind of forecast? And then are you I guess, Auto supply chain customers talking about a potential strike and the impact on their inventory.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. All right. So thank you for the question. Chris, I think we're going to see you in a couple of weeks in New York. So on Auto, I guess some context first, we've grown for 12 consecutive quarters year-over-year. And including the fourth quarter, we're going to be up again. We said in the prepared comments that the lead times and the confidence supply is driving some of that acceleration in inventory adjustments and that's happening across all our markets. When we look specifically at Auto in the quarter and our growth rates there, the same strong growers, BMS, GMSL, A2B. They grew in the third quarter and both on a sequential basis and year-over-year. We expect kind of the similar strength from them into the fourth quarter.So I think that our outlook is, as Vince said, is really end market units driven and we have not yet put in a number nor have we received indicators from our supply chain partners that we should be making adjustments based on any disruption that could come from the negotiations that are going on right now.Vincent Roche: Yes. I think one other thing, Chris, to note is that, in general, there's more and more silicon value in cars every year, and that's true of ADI. We've got the switch to the electrification, which is, again, in pretty much the early stages of adoption. So there are some great growth drivers that will somewhat transcend the malaise, the economic malaise. But we still expect, overall, as Prashanth said, we've got many growth drivers that Automotive will continue to be the one of the better growth areas for ADI for the foreseeable future.Chris Danely: Great. Thanks, guys.Vincent Roche: Thanks, Chris.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.Harlan Sur: Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. So in Q3, disti was down, was about 62% of sales. It was down about 4.5% sequentially. So that's less than the total business. Shipments to our direct customers came down around 8%. So maybe you guys can just discuss the shipments and excess inventory dynamics around both for Q3 and here in Q4. Is the excess inventory situation a little bit more pronounced than direct customers? And maybe similar to your disti customers where you have systems in place to monitor sell-through? Like how do you monitor the levels of sell-through and inventories at your direct customers?Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Great. Okay. So let's do a couple of pieces on that. First, as a reminder, for a distribution company to do business with ADI, you have to give us your sell-through data on a weekly basis in arrears via electronic data feed. So we know exactly where our distribution guys are doing business, and we use that to run the company, as Vince always said, we run it on a POS basis. We said in the third sorry, in the second quarter earnings call, we said that we had gotten a little ahead of ourselves in China and that we intended to undership China. In the third quarter, we have done that. We are now intending to undership all markets generally in the fourth quarter to continue to bring the channel level inventories down.We have limited direct data visibility into our end customers inventory levels, except for those customers where we have consignment. But what we do have is the which you don't have access to is we can see the sales data of our products into our broad set of publicly external customers and their corresponding revenue growth. And our team builds correlation data based on that to tell us how we're doing versus how their growth is. And that's what Vince was referring to that we have seen that their growth is accelerating versus our growth to them, which is why we have confidence that we are undershipping their end market demand, allowing them to pull inventory levels down, which, of course, it is safe to do so because now we can get our products to them within 13 weeks.Michael Lucarelli: Yes. Prashanth that's a great point you made the less lead times is the best indicator of what our customers' inventory levels need to be. if a customer can get product quick, they need to hold a little less inventory. So our lead time is improving is helping us give us better visibility into what the customers need to hold and what they're holding.Vincent Roche: Yes. I think Prashanth said earlier, 85% of our total portfolio now is available in less than 13 weeks. Big, big change since this time last year.Michael Lucarelli: Thank you, Harlan.Harlan Sur: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I had two quick ones, if I may. One on pricing. Vince, you mentioned that in the near term, it's more of a unit correction as opposed to a correction in pricing, which makes sense. To the extent foundry pricing improves into 2024, would you be in a position to share that sort of cost down, if you will, with customers the same way you've sort of passed on higher costs over the past couple of years? And then a second quick one for Prashanth. DOI 179, I think that's up, call it, 50, 60 days vis-a-vis pre-pandemic. How should we think about the new normal going forward? And how quickly can you get there?Vincent Roche: Sure. Let me answer the pricing piece first, Toshiya. There are really two parts to it. One is we have 75,000 product SKUs that are established and are the bedrock of the franchise of the ADI. They're very sticky. The product life cycles tend to be very, very strong. And they tend to be once they're designed and fairly price insensitive. And we're actually -- we're also, by the way, increasing the value of our products each year. We're managing the portfolio in terms of pricing. We're looking for elasticity, which is just a normal part of portfolio management. But -- we're also adding more value to the products that we're introducing to customers, the new products. I think the benefit of lower costs will come at the design-in phase if we do get lower cost, which from our third-party which, by the way, I think, is very, very unlikely. So I think the message is pricing is stable and very, very franchise is very durable.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And I'll do the DOI one very quickly here, Toshi. So 179 days, balance sheet inventory grew call it, low single digits sequentially on a dollar basis. We have high confidence that we will exit Q1, taking out at least $100 million of inventory value. and the production plans are being oriented to allow us to do that. The days target, we have a model, but we've agreed that it is appropriate for the next CFO really to bless that model because they're going to own that and they need to kind of go through that map. So I can tell you that it's not going to be at 180 days, but I don't think we get back to 120 days. So we'll come back to you at some point on what that looks like.Toshiya Hari: That's very helpful. Thank you, both.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks Toshi. Take last question, please.Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Josh Buchalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open.Josh Buchalter: Hi, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. And Prashanth, congratulations on the great run. You mentioned a few times under shipping in the print and the guidance. I was hoping you could maybe quantify the extent or maybe provide any sort of guidance to the amount that you're under shipping? And then given it sounds like seasonal fiscal first quarter isn't off the table. Does that mean we kind of expect you could be shipping to end demand exiting the October quarter? Thank you.Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I'll let Mike take the second part of that question because I'm not sure I fully comprehended it. But on the first one, so we have our business that goes through the channel and the business that goes direct. Business through the channel, we have the demand forecast from our distribution guys, and we are under shipping into the channel to help them pull inventory levels in the channel down. We said that in the second quarter earnings call that we were going to do that for China. This quarter, we're going to do it across the globe for all distis. Your second question on how to think about the under shipment into end demand that Vince referenced to. All I can really do is refer back to sort of the data analysis that we do.There's not a real way to aggregate that, except to say that we have a relatively good correlation between our end customers revenue growth and our growth to those end customers on an individual basis and when we look at how they grew in third quarter versus our shipments to them and how they're forecasting or you guys or consensus forecasting their fourth quarter growth versus our shipments to them, we know that we're going to be helping them to pull inventory levels down, which again makes tremendous sense because lead times have improved. And Mike, I didn't...Michael Lucarelli: Sure. On the first -- it's good question. If you look at the first quarter, we always typically undership consumption in the first quarter, why? You see a lot of our customers reduce their working capital going into end of the year-end. So the down 5% in our -- seeing the seasonal first quarter is below consumption. I think after that, you get back to kind of what Vince was saying you get coming back to demand and consumption, all kind of imbalance. And then it comes to a question of macro, what's happening in macro in our second quarter. Thank you, Josh.Josh Buchalter: Okay. Definitely helpful. Thank you.Michael Lucarelli: Any time. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We once again will be on the road a lot this quarter. You'll find us in New York, Chicago, Florida, London and San Fran. Reach out to IR team to be notified when we are in your ZIP code. And with that, thanks for joining us and the interest in ADI.Operator: This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now.5G is one of those areas that are guaranteed to grow and see huge investments in the coming years. The 5G boom will give rise to a complete ecosystem, which, when coupled with future technologies like AI and IoT, will create a plethora of opportunities in the industry. Governments and private sector around the word are scrambling to unlock opportunities in the 5G space. The 5G connectivity penetration will create new growth avenues in hardware and software space. A 2020 report by Edward Jones on 5G said that 5G connectivity will take quite some time to realize due to complex and technical infrastructure needs. The report also said that 5G deployment will not be able to reach completion levels until software developers test and gauge how to best utilize high speeds and response times that are unlocked by 5G.The report also talked about some specific companies that stand to benefit from the upcoming 5G revolution.""In the communication services sector, we anticipate that Verizon (VZ) will be well-positioned to offer 5G services because it is aggressively building its 5G network. We believe that AT&amp;T (T) will also benefit from 5G, although its business is more diversified than Verizon's, so 5G may have less of an impact on AT&amp;T's overall results. For investors seeking international diversification, Canadian telecom company BCE (BCE) will be introducing 5G services, although we expect the 5G build in Canada to lag about a year behind the U.S implementation. Also, we believe Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) could benefit from 5G due to its significant investment in developing driverless-vehicle technology. We anticipate that American Tower (AMT) will benefit because service providers throughout the world will need to add 5G equipment at wireless tower sites. However, we note that all of these companies have exposure to a number of markets besides 5G, so results can be impacted by changes in other parts of their businesses.""Story continuesThat’s why investors are looking for promising opportunities in the space to benefit from the long-term growth catalysts in the industry. However, the industry has seen headwinds lately amid a decline in spending. Nokia’s management recently talked about these challenges and said that the slowdown in the 5G sector would prove to be short term as there’s still a huge demand and appetite for investments. Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark recently said in an interview with Bloomberg that there’s “substantial need for operators to invest in 5G globally with only approximately 25% of the potential mid-band 5G base stations so far deployed outside China.”The economic benefits of the 5G revolution will be seen far and wide. A PwC report estimates that healthcare sector will be the biggest beneficiary of the 5G connectivity penetration. The report said that the 5G effect on healthcare could add almost half a trillion dollars to global GDP. Other industries that stand to benefit from 5G include utilities, consumer, media, industrial manufacturing and financial services. PwC said that in aggregate, 5G adoption will add about $13 trillion to global GDP by 2023. The report said that the biggest benefit of 5G will be seen in North America, followed by Asia and the Oceania. However, as mentioned by Edward Jones, PwC also said that initially, the effect of 5G will be slow and not much visible. But starting 2025, there will be glaring benefits of 5G visible in different economies throughout the world.Best 5G Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Mika Baumeister on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article first scanned Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSEARCA:FIVG) and listed its holdings.

Through both organic development and acquisitions led by CEO Matt Murphy since he took over in 2016, Marvell has built a portfolio of market-leading products and IP across computing, networking, security, electro-optics, and storage. Consequently, the company is a critical partner for hyperscale cloud service provider, data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end-market customers. Marvell is targeting 15% to 20% average revenue growth through the semiconductor cycle in the coming years, largely driven by secular trends and company-specific product innovations within the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets. We believe Marvell can deliver on or exceed this target because, among other growth opportunities, its market-leading optical products are critical to delivering increasing data transmission speeds required by hyperscale customers in AI training and inference. At the same time, the company is simultaneously ramping up a custom silicon business working directly with hyperscale partners. Given the dislocation in the stock on near-term cyclical concerns, we believe we paid an attractive price for the long-term growth of this industry-leading company.”11. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a REIT that operates properties for data centers, wireless communications infrastructure and related operations. Amid a growing demand for 5G infrastructure, the American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) stands to benefit due to its dominance in the industry.In July, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) upped its 2023 guidance for adjusted funds from operations, primarily due to core property outperformance. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) also posted strong Q2 results. AFFO in the period came in at $2.46 beating estimates by $0.04.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 69 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database of 943 funds reported owning stakes in QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM).Here is what Aristotle Value Equity has to say about QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Qualcomm, a leading wireless communications technology company, was one of the largest detractors for the period. Weaker demand for handsets, elevated channel inventory and an underwhelming Chinese economic recovery resulted in a more difficult‐than‐expected short‐term outlook. Qualcomm executives are navigating the short‐term challenges by actively managing operating expenses. In recent years, despite threats of large clients developing in‐house chips (e.g., Apple and Samsung), Qualcomm has been able to retain its high market share forged by a history of high spending in R&amp;D and what we consider to be technological superiority. Longer term, we believe Qualcomm will continue to benefit from 5G penetration, as well as from the execution of its diversification strategy, asInternet of Things and Automotive remain attractive end markets. As the world continues on the path toward a proliferation of connectivity between varying devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, wearable technology, Wi‐Fi access points, factory automation and infotainment systems in autos), we are convinced the company is in a strong position to continue to win market share in both existing and new end markets, and to continue to return FREE cash flow to shareholders.”8.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) as of the end of the first quarter.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Broadcom contributed to outperformance, as the company is seen as a key beneficiary of the investment in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). The company’s Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips are being custom-built for customers to use in their data centers for accelerated computing. Broadcom’s networking chipsets are also expected to see increased levels of demand, as customers increase investments to enable the high-speed data transfer required by advanced AI training and inference. The company also announced a new multi-year supplier relationship with Apple, the company’s largest customer.”7. Analog Devices, Inc.

Analog Devices and Danaher are both seeing end market demand moderate (in semiconductor and medical research, respectively) compared to the artificially high levels they experienced for two years due to the post-Covid chaos in supply chains.

(NYSE:V) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 77% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-nyse-v-favoured-120043451.html,1692964843,STORY,['V'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Visa's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 38% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockEvery investor in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 77% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Visa. View our latest analysis for Visa ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Visa already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Visa's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Visa. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 7.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.2% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 3.6% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of VisaWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Visa Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$246m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Visa. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Visa better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Shares have added about 2.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Visa due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Visa Q3 Earnings Beat Mark on Rising Cross-Border VolumeVisa reported fiscal third-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 by 2.4%. The bottom line improved 9% year over year.Net revenues amounted to $8,123 million, which advanced 12% year over year in the quarter under review. The top line outpaced the consensus mark by 0.7%.The solid quarterly results benefited on the back of higher payments, and cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and higher-than-expected data processing aided the results, partially offset by higher costs.Q3 Business DriversVisa’s payments volume grew 9% year over year on a constant-dollar basis in the fiscal third quarter, backed by strength seen in CEMEA and LAC regions. Processed transactions (implying transactions processed by Visa) totaled 54 billion, which rose 10% year over year and beat our estimate of 51.3 billion.On a constant-dollar basis, the cross-border volume of Visa climbed 17% year over year in the quarter under review. Excluding transactions within Europe, its cross-border volume (that boosts a company’s international transaction revenues) advanced 22% year over year on a constant-dollar basis.Q3 Operational PerformanceService revenues improved 15% year over year to $3.7 billion during the June quarter on the back of better payment volumes. The metric was in line with our estimate. V’s data processing revenues of $4.1 billion grew 15% year over year in the quarter under review, beating our estimate of $3.9 billion.Story continuesInternational transaction revenues advanced 14% year over year to $2.9 billion, which met our estimate on higher cross-border volume. Other revenues of $597 million climbed 15% year over year, but came lower than our estimate of $613.4 million.Client incentives (a contra-revenue item) of Visa escalated 23% year over year to $3.2 billion in the quarter under review and met our estimate. The metric amounted to 28.1% of Visa’s gross revenues of $11.3 billion.Total adjusted operating expenses of $2.6 billion increased 10% year over year and met our estimate. The increase was due to elevated personnel costs and professional fees. Interest expense came in at $182 million, up 64% year over year.Balance Sheet (as of Jun 30, 2023)Visa exited the June quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $15.6 billion, which marginally dropped from the 2022 fiscal year-end level of $15.7 billion.Total assets of $89.2 billion increased from the 2022 fiscal year-end level of $85.5 billion.V’s long-term debt amounted to $20.6 billion, which inched up from the fiscal year-end level of $20.2 billion.Total equity grew from the 2022 fiscal year-end level of $35.6 billion to $39 billion.Cash FlowsVisa generated net cash from operations of $13.8 billion in the nine months ended Jun 30, 2023, which increased from $13 billion a year ago. Fiscal third-quarter free cash flows of $5,502 million rose from $5,017 million a year ago.Capital Deployment UpdateVisa rewarded $3.9 billion to shareholders via share buybacks of almost $3 billion and dividends of $937 million in the June quarter. V had authorized funds of $8.8 billion remaining under its share buyback program as of Jun 30, 2023.On Jul 25, 2023, management sanctioned a quarterly cash dividend of 45 cents per share, which will be paid out on Sep 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Aug 11, 2023.OutlookFor the fiscal fourth quarter, it expects net revenue growth of around 10%. Client incentives for full year are expected to remain at the upper side of 26.5-27.5% of gross revenues.

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most historic stock indexes in America, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world. It was set up in 1896 and holds a central place in the history of the stock market as a result. This also lends the index a special status where the stocks that are included in it are called blue chip stocks, which alludes to their high value and overall stability.Stocks included in the Dow index do not stay there forever. The index in its current form which is limited to 30 stocks came into being in 1928 when it was expanded to reflect the roaring market conditions of the time. This time period was one of the most prosperous in the early history of the Dow index, as 1928 marked an eight year bull run that had started in 1920. It started after the end of the first world war which had left an economic recession in the United States and it would end with much worse economic circumstances coming in as the Great Depression would start. In terms of percentage point drops in economic activity, the Great Depression would be fifteen times as bad as the contraction during the Great Recession after the economic crisis in 2008. Like the housing crisis, the Great Depression also began in the U.S. and then spread all over the world, with stocks believed to have lost more than three quarters of value during the time period.After the Great Depression, the next period of turbulence in the Dow would come during the 1970s when the U.S. shifted away from gold and Saudi Arabia led an oil embargo that led to severe inflation all across America along with dropping economic growth as the pumps dried up. The stock market, which as a whole relies on economic growth and prosperity, does not like any turbulence in either the oil supply or the economy, and as a result, the Dow did poorly. The index would continue to withstand turmoil during the next couple of decades, and with the turn of the millennium, it would lag the losses of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 during the time when the devastating September 11 attacks shook markets.Story continuesThe index's history has also seen several companies come and go. The longest running component of the Dow index is believed to be General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric is one of the oldest companies in America, and it was part of the original Dow index of 1896. Keeping its place in the list of elite stocks for 122 years, the firm exited the Dow in 2018. True to its name the ""Dow Jones 'Industrial' Average,"" most of the original constituents of the Dow were industrial companies. However, its reshaping has been influenced by trends in the broader U.S. economy, with the latest additions being some of the most consequential firms of today such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The chairman and managing director of the Dow Indices index's committee Mr. David Blitzer was cognizant of the evolutionary dynamics in the stock market at the time of GE's de-listing, as he commented:Since then [1907] the U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.Right now, five out of the 30 stocks in the Dow index are information technology firms, making it the largest sector in the index. After tech, the largest sector in the index is financial services, and together, the pair represent nine out of the 30 companies in the Dow. Currently, the oldest member of the index is The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which was added in 1932 and the three youngest additions are Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). According to S&amp;P Dow Jones, the change was prompted after Apple split its shares four to one, which ended up affecting the index's weights.Taking stock of the Dow's performance this year, the index has gained a modest 2.91%, which reflects the mixed performance in the U.S. economy. While technology stocks have soared, other areas such as regional banking and real estate haven't fared so well.

Shares have lost about 3.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verizon due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Verizon Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates, Falters on RevenuesVerizon reported mixed second-quarter 2023 results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The telecom giant is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum. Strong demand for Fios and fixed wireless products also led to healthy broadband performance with total broadband net additions of 418,000.Verizon witnessed solid traction in the wireless business with 8,000 total postpaid phone net additions in the quarter along with retail postpaid net additions of 612,000. This buoyed the shares in pre-market trading.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the quarter was $4,766 million or $1.10 per share compared with $5,315 million or $1.24 per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease despite lower operating expenses was primarily attributable to top-line contraction. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings per share were $1.21 compared with $1.31 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.RevenuesQuarterly total operating revenues decreased to $32,596 million from $33,789 million in the prior year owing to lower wireless equipment revenues driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and lower postpaid phone upgrades. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $33,390 million.Quarterly Segment ResultsConsumer: Total revenues from this segment declined 4.1% year over year to $24,558 million, as higher service revenues were more than offset by lower equipment revenues in the quarter. However, it exceeded our revenue estimate of $23,891 million for the segment led by solid wireless momentum.Service revenues were up 2.7% to $18,641 million, while wireless equipment revenues slumped 22.4% to $4,430 million. Other revenues totaled $1,487 million, down 14.9% year over year.The segment recorded 136,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net losses and 304,000 wireless retail prepaid net losses in the quarter. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 0.95%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 0.76%. The company recorded 51,000 Fios Internet net additions as high demand for reliable fiber optic broadband was spurred by increasing work-from-home trend. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 251,000 for the quarter. However, Verizon registered 69,000 Fios Video net losses in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.The segment’s operating income improved 2.5% to $7,330 million on lower operating expenses with a margin of 29.8%, up from 27.9% in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA increased 2.1% to $10,577 million with a margin of 43.1% compared with 40.5% in the prior-year quarter due to lower costs of wireless equipment.Business: The segment revenues were down 1.9% to $7,483 million due to lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by growth in wireless service revenue. It also was lower than our estimates of $7,657 million largely due to challenging macroeconomic conditions.The segment had 308,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 144,000 postpaid phone net additions. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.48%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 1.10%. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 133,000 for the quarter. Operating income declined to $533 million from $675 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 7.1% and 8.9%. EBITDA was down 6.5% to $1,636 million owing to decline in high margin wireline revenues for a margin of 21.9% compared with 22.9% in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesOther Quarterly DetailsTotal operating expenses decreased 3.3% year over year to $25,376 million, while operating income was down 4.4% to $7,220 million. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA improved to $11,971 million from $11,873 million for respective margins of 36.7% and 35.1%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityVerizon generated $18,020 million of net cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2023 compared with $17,665 million in the year-ago period. The improvement was primarily due to working capital improvements driven by lower inventory levels, fewer phone upgrades and a modest improvement in customer payment patterns. Free cash flow was $5,619 million for the quarter compared with $6,174 million in the prior-year period.As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $4,803 million in cash and cash equivalents with $137,871 million of long-term debt.Guidance ReiteratedVerizon has reiterated its guidance for 2023 and expects wireless service revenue growth in the range of 2.5%-4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be $47-$48.5 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share. Capital expenditure is estimated between $18.25 billion and $19.25 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Verizon has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

220,690984f9-270d-38ac-b9c8-3e70dd61c615,VZ,2023-08-25,14 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-best-5g-stocks-buy-131204432.html,1692882724,STORY,"['VZ', 'MRVL', 'AMT', 'QCOM', 'INTC', 'CSCO', 'T', 'AVGO', 'ADI', 'CHTR']","[In this article, we will take a look at the 14 best 5G stocks to buy now. To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now.5G is one of those areas that are guaranteed to grow and see huge investments in the coming years. The 5G boom will give rise to a complete ecosystem, which, when coupled with future technologies like AI and IoT, will create a plethora of opportunities in the industry. Governments and private sector around the word are scrambling to unlock opportunities in the 5G space. The 5G connectivity penetration will create new growth avenues in hardware and software space. A 2020 report by Edward Jones on 5G said that 5G connectivity will take quite some time to realize due to complex and technical infrastructure needs. The report also said that 5G deployment will not be able to reach completion levels until software developers test and gauge how to best utilize high speeds and response times that are unlocked by 5G.The report also talked about some specific companies that stand to benefit from the upcoming 5G revolution.""In the communication services sector, we anticipate that Verizon (VZ) will be well-positioned to offer 5G services because it is aggressively building its 5G network. We believe that AT&amp;T (T) will also benefit from 5G, although its business is more diversified than Verizon's, so 5G may have less of an impact on AT&amp;T's overall results. For investors seeking international diversification, Canadian telecom company BCE (BCE) will be introducing 5G services, although we expect the 5G build in Canada to lag about a year behind the U.S implementation. Also, we believe Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) could benefit from 5G due to its significant investment in developing driverless-vehicle technology. We anticipate that American Tower (AMT) will benefit because service providers throughout the world will need to add 5G equipment at wireless tower sites. However, we note that all of these companies have exposure to a number of markets besides 5G, so results can be impacted by changes in other parts of their businesses.""Story continuesThat’s why investors are looking for promising opportunities in the space to benefit from the long-term growth catalysts in the industry. However, the industry has seen headwinds lately amid a decline in spending. Nokia’s management recently talked about these challenges and said that the slowdown in the 5G sector would prove to be short term as there’s still a huge demand and appetite for investments. Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark recently said in an interview with Bloomberg that there’s “substantial need for operators to invest in 5G globally with only approximately 25% of the potential mid-band 5G base stations so far deployed outside China.”The economic benefits of the 5G revolution will be seen far and wide. A PwC report estimates that healthcare sector will be the biggest beneficiary of the 5G connectivity penetration. The report said that the 5G effect on healthcare could add almost half a trillion dollars to global GDP. Other industries that stand to benefit from 5G include utilities, consumer, media, industrial manufacturing and financial services. PwC said that in aggregate, 5G adoption will add about $13 trillion to global GDP by 2023. The report said that the biggest benefit of 5G will be seen in North America, followed by Asia and the Oceania. However, as mentioned by Edward Jones, PwC also said that initially, the effect of 5G will be slow and not much visible. But starting 2025, there will be glaring benefits of 5G visible in different economies throughout the world.Best 5G Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Mika Baumeister on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article first scanned Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSEARCA:FIVG) and listed its holdings.

Through both organic development and acquisitions led by CEO Matt Murphy since he took over in 2016, Marvell has built a portfolio of market-leading products and IP across computing, networking, security, electro-optics, and storage. Consequently, the company is a critical partner for hyperscale cloud service provider, data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end-market customers. Marvell is targeting 15% to 20% average revenue growth through the semiconductor cycle in the coming years, largely driven by secular trends and company-specific product innovations within the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets. We believe Marvell can deliver on or exceed this target because, among other growth opportunities, its market-leading optical products are critical to delivering increasing data transmission speeds required by hyperscale customers in AI training and inference. At the same time, the company is simultaneously ramping up a custom silicon business working directly with hyperscale partners. Given the dislocation in the stock on near-term cyclical concerns, we believe we paid an attractive price for the long-term growth of this industry-leading company.”11.

Weaker demand for handsets, elevated channel inventory and an underwhelming Chinese economic recovery resulted in a more difficult‐than‐expected short‐term outlook. Qualcomm executives are navigating the short‐term challenges by actively managing operating expenses. In recent years, despite threats of large clients developing in‐house chips (e.g., Apple and Samsung), Qualcomm has been able to retain its high market share forged by a history of high spending in R&amp;D and what we consider to be technological superiority. Longer term, we believe Qualcomm will continue to benefit from 5G penetration, as well as from the execution of its diversification strategy, asInternet of Things and Automotive remain attractive end markets. As the world continues on the path toward a proliferation of connectivity between varying devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, wearable technology, Wi‐Fi access points, factory automation and infotainment systems in autos), we are convinced the company is in a strong position to continue to win market share in both existing and new end markets, and to continue to return FREE cash flow to shareholders.”8.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) as of the end of the first quarter.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Broadcom contributed to outperformance, as the company is seen as a key beneficiary of the investment in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). The company’s Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips are being custom-built for customers to use in their data centers for accelerated computing. Broadcom’s networking chipsets are also expected to see increased levels of demand, as customers increase investments to enable the high-speed data transfer required by advanced AI training and inference.

Analog Devices and Danaher are both seeing end market demand moderate (in semiconductor and medical research, respectively) compared to the artificially high levels they experienced for two years due to the post-Covid chaos in supply chains.

This new technology provides a path for lower-complexity and lower-cost NR devices such as consumer wearables, fitness trackers and mobile medical devices. It also paves the way for enterprise IoT solutions like video surveillance, industrial sensors, and smart grids to run more efficiently on Verizon’s 5G network.These devices, many of which have audio functions requiring voice connections, typically transmit and receive smaller amounts of data than smartphones, wireless routers or more robust enterprise solutions. Using the new software and light chipset, engineers have successfully demonstrated more efficient paths for these and future low-cost, low-power devices to run over the Verizon network, which can lead to the development and deployment of smaller, lighter, lower complexity devices with longer battery lives.“The network transformation we have undergone the past few years has brought us to this place of having a highly sophisticated and customizable network able to provide a range of capabilities needed for a variety of devices,” said Adam Koeppe, SVP of Network and Technology Planning at Verizon. “The evolution of this new light software coupled with the technologies deployed throughout our 5G network will allow us to provide the best possible experience for our customers in an efficient manner and will drive the 5G ecosystem with low-cost, energy-efficient devices.”“Pioneering both data and VoNR calls on both low- and mid-bands on Verizon’s 5G standalone network demonstrates the capability of Ericsson RedCap as a software to boost a whole new range of use cases for both consumers and enterprises,” said Graham Osborne, Vice President and Head of Customer Unit Verizon, Ericsson North America. “This over-the-air demonstration in a live C-Band environment with Verizon and MediaTek is critical to building an ecosystem that will bring multiple types of 5G devices to market.”Story continues“This successful collaboration with Verizon and Ericsson marks another milestone in our development of our 5G RedCap platform,” said Dr HC Hwang, General Manager of Wireless Communication Systems &amp; Partnerships at MediaTek. “This technology paves the way for cost-effective and power-efficient use cases such as wearables, IoT devices, AR glasses and more, all without taxing current 5G networks that need to accommodate higher performance systems and products.”The recent trials efficiently and successfully completed data and voice sessions which are critical for consumer wearables and audio-enabled enterprise solutions. Both voice and data sessions were completed using 5G technology over C-band TDD spectrum as well as 5G technology over 850 MHz FDD spectrum, in Verizon’s production network employing Verizon’s 5G standalone core. Once this technology is deployed in the commercial network, Verizon will continue to work with consumer and business solution developers to accelerate 5G device development driving the entire ecosystem forward.The introduction of New Radio (NR) RedCap devices will help expand the 5G ecosystem by caring for specific use cases with more efficient resource allocation. RedCap offers similar data rates to LTE enabled devices with improved latency, device energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency. This technology also has the potential to support 5G NR features such as enhanced positioning and network slicing.Verizon Communications Inc.

Rolex says 48 of those locations also sell Tudor watches, which Rolex owns as well. According to the Tourneau | Bucherer website, the retailer operates 34 locations in the US.Both Rolex and Bucherer are closely held, private companies that do not disclose financial data and metrics. It has been estimated that in 2021 Rolex made 1.05 million watches and generated $8.8 billion in revenue. Bucherer and Tourneau will keep their respective names and continue to operate as independent businesses, Rolex said. Rolex also said the merger will take effect once regulatory authorities have approved the transaction.Big Business in New York City. (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx) (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)While the move into retail is a surprise for Rolex, perhaps it shouldn't be, experts said.""Rolex has such huge demand for their watches that I have long felt it does not make sense that they give 32% of the retail price to a retailer,"" industry watcher Eric Wind of Wind Vintage said to Yahoo Finance. ""From a business perspective, it only made sense to have stores through which they can try to receive 100% of the retail price of the watch, as well as to develop direct relationships with end customers rather than allowing other retailers to have that relationship.""People wearing face masks walk past a Rolex store at a financial district in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila, Philippines, Sept. 22, 2020. (Eloisa Lopez/REUTERS) (Eloisa Lopez / reuters)Rolex’s move into retail comes with a few headwinds in the industry. Luxury dealer Watches of Switzerland Group reported that first half sales suffered from a “challenging trading environment,” though it noted demand remains strong. Overall Swiss watch exports for the month of July also slipped — the first monthly decline in two years — reflecting weakness in China.Story continuesThe luxury space as a whole also seems to be challenged as 2023 progresses. LVMH reported second quarter sales that missed estimates, with sales growth stalling — and even dropping in the US.There's also evidence that a softening in the retail space may lead to more consolidation. For example: Tapestry (the operator of luxury names Coach and Kate Spade), acquired Capri Holdings in an $8.5 billion deal. Capri Holdings is the name behind Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors.Rolex, meanwhile, seems to have weathered a dip in the secondhand and “gray market” (i.e., unauthorized or third party) prices for watches. Recent price declines in the overall luxury watch market in the past year indicate the market may be correcting.“The recent acquisition of Bucherer by Rolex is an intriguing move in the luxury market landscape. The opportunity is rife with the potential rebranding of these storied watch and jewelry outlets under the iconic Rolex moniker,"" said Paul Altieri, CEO of luxury watch dealer Bob's Watches to Yahoo Finance. ""Should Rolex indeed opt for this branding strategy, and I’m not saying they will do so immediately, it would brilliantly align with the steps taken by other luxury juggernauts like Cartier, Tiffany, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels.""Perhaps this is why Rolex is keen to acquire Bucherer, though Rolex’s big move into retail is also a sign the watch giant is confident that it can gain size and scale, as well as increase its profitability. It could also be seen as a move to diversify its business beyond Rolex and Tudor, as Bucherer and Tourneau offer a number of other luxury watch brands, in addition to fine jewelry.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the performance of ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Performing ETFs in 2023. Amid concerns about the unpredictable economy and rapid stock market movements, strategies focused on safe investments are largely preferred by investors in 2023. In June 2023, the chief investment officer at Astoria Portfolio Advisors, John Davi, joined CNBC’s “ETF Edge” and highlighted three big ETF trends he’s seeing this year. Davi noted that bond ETFs have attracted $82 billion in investments this year, as opposed to $55 billion that has entered equity funds. Another trend highlighted by Davi is the disparity in flow patterns between non-U.S. and U.S. ETFs. Among equity ETFs, non-U.S. funds have received $40 billion in investments this year, while U.S. equities have secured $14 billion. Lasly, the shift from value to growth is an important trend to watch. Also Read: 12 Best NASDAQ ETFsAccording to Natixis Investment Managers, there has been a significant decline in the influx of investments into equity ETFs in 2023 compared to the relatively steady flow observed in 2022. In contrast, fixed income ETFs have maintained a consistently robust and favorable net flow throughout this year. The firm expects that this upward trend in fixed income ETFs will continue due to the influence of three ongoing factors. Firstly, investor apprehension regarding an economic recession that might trigger a decline in the stock market; secondly, the appeal of exceptionally favorable short-term interest rates; and thirdly, concerns about potential bank failures. Moreover, the present state of the market might further strengthen investors' preference for active ETF management, given that notable market volatility has generated opportunities for active managers to capitalize on. Furthermore, over the course of 2023, Natixis expects an increase in the number of options-related ETFs. Data extracted from Strategic Insight's Simfund indicates a more than twofold growth in assets from 2020 onwards, which suggests a greater level of investor interest towards options overlays. Story continuesDon't Miss: 10 Best Industrial ETFsThe global ETF market has gained remarkable momentum in the last half-decade.

Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)8.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Dramatic valuation differences across market cap sizes continue. This has been the case for some time now. Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

The Nasdaq has lost more than 7.2% in the last three weeks, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 4.6%, its worst three-week decline since the Mar 10 week.Bond Yields SoarThe recent jump in bond yields is taking a toll on the stock market. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.366% on Aug 22, hitting its highest level since 2007 and up nearly 40 bps month to date.An increase in bond yields reduces the appeal of a stock's future earnings. This is because higher bond yields provide investors with the opportunity to get lucrative returns from investments that are considerably safer in comparison to stocks.The recent rise in bond yields came just after the release of minutes of the Fed’s July FOMC that revealed that central bank officials are maintaining a hawkish stance as they believe that more interest rate hikes would be required to ease inflationary pressures. Every time interest rates increase, bond prices fall, which increases their yield.Fed Open for More Rate HikesInflation has sharply declined and nearly halved from its 40-year-high of 9.1% in June 2022. However, the Fed is open to more interest rate hikes as inflation is still elevated and a lot higher than its 2% target.Meanwhile, investors’ sentiments were dented further after the S&amp;P Global Ratings on Aug 21 cut the credit ratings on five regional banks with high commercial real estate exposure. This comes after Fitch Ratings, earlier this month, downgraded the U.S. long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+.Also, credit rating agency Moody’s, earlier this month, downgraded several banks and kept six on review for potential downgrades.Story continuesWorries Over ChinaChina's economic worries are further hurting investor confidence.

This marked the 23rd consecutive quarter of a composite price increase.

The Fed had raised its key interest rate by 0.25% and reached a target of 5.25-5.5%, which marked the highest level in 22 years. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top lines.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.

236,a2607dd9-a6cc-3a98-af2b-a272aa962c71,FOX,2023-08-25,Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.26,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-nasdaq-foxa-increasing-dividend-100828264.html,1692958108,STORY,['FOXA'],"[The board of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.26 on the 27th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Although the dividend is now higher, the yield is only 1.6%, which is below the industry average. View our latest analysis for Fox Fox's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Before making this announcement, Fox was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 48.6%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 14% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendFox Doesn't Have A Long Payment HistoryLooking back, the dividend has been stable, but the company hasn't been paying a dividend for very long so we can't be confident that the dividend will remain stable through all economic environments. The annual payment during the last 4 years was $0.46 in 2019, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $0.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 3.1% a year over that time. We like that the dividend hasn't been shrinking. However we're conscious that the company hasn't got an overly long track record of dividend payments yet, which makes us wary of relying on its dividend income.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. In the last five years, Fox's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 6.4% per annum. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesIn SummaryOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Fox will make a great income stock. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

239,5b7fa37d-44d4-37e5-8020-3dcfa1b50d82,CMI,2023-08-25,Tech Breakthrough Makes $2.5 Trillion Hydrogen Boom Possible,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-breakthrough-makes-2-5-000000892.html,1692921600,STORY,"['NG=F', 'BP', 'FCEL', 'BLDP', 'LIN', 'PLUG', 'CMI', 'BE']","[The U.S. government has announced a proposed $7 billion (for starters) on desperately needed breakthroughs in clean hydrogen production.The Department of Energy’s (DoE) biggest bet is on nuclear power plants, which they are hoping to convert into North America’s premier clean hydrogen producers.Those billions of dollars are being poured into technological innovation, lowering costs and scaling up the production of clean hydrogen, including through the use of nuclear power plants in New York, Ohio, Minnesota and Arizona.For now, the majority of hydrogen in the United States is produced by natural gas reforming in large central plants—an important step in the energy transition. The end goal, however, is to produce hydrogen without creating carbon emissions, and that’s what the federal government’s $ 7 billion spend is all about.At four nuclear plants across the country, scientists are trying to perfect a process called “electrolysis” to create pure, clean hydrogen. The process involves splitting water into pure hydrogen and oxygen using high temperature electrolyzers.  For now, however, the process is prohibitively expensive and energy intensive.That could make this recent breakthrough all the more significant …GH Power has developed a unique renewable energy technology that uses exothermic reactions to create three highly sought-after green outputs: hydrogen, alumina (aluminum oxide) and exothermic heat, killing three birds with one high-tech stone.The hydrogen produced by the modular version of GH Power’s 2MW reactor is pure and clean, with zero emissions, zero carbon and zero waste, using only 2 inputs (recycled aluminum and water).GH Power has been developing the new type of reaction for hydrogen production over the past 7 years, and now it’s gearing up to flip the switch on the first commercial reactor of its kind in Hamilton Ontario, Canada.Flipping the switch on this new reactor comes at a critical juncture in the global energy transition. The Hydrogen Council estimates that hydrogen will represent 18% of all energy delivered to end users by 2050, avoiding 6 gigatonnes of carbon emissions annually and turning around an approximated $2.5 trillion in annual sales (not to mention creating 30 million jobs globally).Story continuesVISUALIZING A FUTURE POWERED BY CLEAN HYDROGENGH Power’s reactor is self-sustaining, zero emission and is a net producer of energy for consumption.  It’s 100% clean and modular, which means it can be assembled on site to power North America’s industries for the first time with clean energy and cost competitive with conventional fossil fuels.It also produces green hydrogen, exothermic heat, as well as highly valuable green alumina, which has numerous commercial applications used for everything from lithium-ion batteries and LED lighting to semiconductor production. The GH Power process is proprietary and breakthrough: GH Power is planning to develop a plant which produces 11,700 Tonnes of green hydrogen per year to fuel 30 MW combined cycle plant with a net output of 27 MW.For now, the DoE puts the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable energy at about $5 per kilogram, which is about 3X higher than the price of producing hydrogen from natural gas. The DoE’s goal is to see clean hydrogen production costs decline by 80% to $1 per kilogram in a decade.By the company’s estimates, GH Power’s reactor is already 60% cheaper than producing hydrogen by electrolysis, and it is a net producer of electricity to the grid.  Its green alumina co-product production costs are also over 85% cheaper than the most commonly used processes currently used for alumina production that rely on hydrochloric acid leaching and hydrolysis for alumina production. This could be a game changer in the decarbonization of the critical sector.Finally, GH Power’s base 27MW net output plant design is forecast to produce a carbon offset of 1.2 million tonnes annually (based on displacing a coal-fired plant the same size)The company has also had successful tests using scrap steel (iron) as another metal fuel for hydrogen generation.  The use of recycled metals provides a scalable solution with a much lower costs basis at under a $1/kg hydrogen. Scrap iron is the most widely available metal fuel in most markets.Not only is this a cost breakthrough, but it is a proprietary technology that embraces the idea of a circular economy with zero emissions.The process uses recycled scrap aluminum as the key input. That aluminum is then mixed with water through a proprietary reactor designed to continuously operate to produce hydrogen, alumina and exothermic heat (power) with zero emissions.Scrap or recycled aluminum is widely available in almost every market, and can be found for as little as $1.50/kg.It’s a new technology that can run full circle from using recyclable materials to help other companies, organizations, and industries to meet their own net-zero commitments. And it’s all modular and brings the energy to within the last mile of the energy user. For hydrogen, it could be a huge competitive advantage to be able to build a plant right where it’s needed, without massive hydrogen storage facilities and without transportation needs.FLIPPING THE SWITCH ON THE FIRST REACTORGH Power and its team of engineers have already completed Phase 1 testing of their 2MW reactor in Hamilton, Ontario, and Phase 2 testing began on June 30th.Next step is to move into commercial operations and 24-hour continuous operations.Revenue generation is forecast to begin in the fourth quarter, and then the future is all about scaling up from 2MW reactors to a 27MW Net Output power solution.The scaled-up 27 Net Output MW version of this reactor, planned for the near future, will produce the same three green outputs which can be blended with natural gas in a turbine. This could allow GH Power’s solution to integrate with existing natural gas power plants and allow companies to utilize existing assets while making a serious reduction in CO2 emissions.The world needs 520 million tonnes of hydrogen to achieve net-zero targets by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Given the current state of advancement with electrolysis for producing hydrogen and the associated costs, we won’t make that goal without alternative breakthroughs such as GH Power’s. And because this new reactor aims to produce three green outputs, the contributions to zero-emissions goals should be compounded far beyond the individual numbers.This award-winning technology is the result of seven years of painstaking research by world-class scientists and engineers, led by GH Power CEO Dave White, a veteran engineer in the power generation space. Combined, the GH Power team has, has well over a century of power generation experience in the design, build and operation of power plants, refineries, and other energy infrastructure.Chief Engineer Ken Stewart has been designing and managing thermal power plant and petrochemical processes for over four decades and across eight different power plants in North America.  COO Gary Grahn brings to the table 25 years of international energy experience, including in oil, gas, minerals, metals and utilities, and CFO Anand Patel contributes a decade of real asset capital markets experience, with over $4 billion in completed transactions, including for renewable energy giant Brookfield Asset Management. Finally, project development director Mike Miller offers more than 35 years of experience infrastructure, private equity and development for top companies along the energy supply chain, such as giant NextEra Energy.GH Power has been working closely with Carleton University and is the recipient of a $2.2-million grant from a joint German-Canadian government program as part of Canada’s alliance with Germany to bolster its hydrogen strategy. It’s a feather in Canada’s cap as the country seeks to become a top global supplier of clean hydrogen with a transatlantic supply chain.The idea itself is in line with what world-renowned physicist Neil de Grasse Tyson calls the ‘cosmic perspective.’ Large-scale green hydrogen projects in existence today are only as clean as the energy required to produce them and only as plausible as the cost required to get to the end game.   “The only practical solution for society to reduce carbon emissions is to transition from 100% fossil fuels to cleaner tech,” and one of the steps in tackling this is to blend cost-competitive green hydrogen with fossil fuels and ramp up the hydrogen content whenever possible,” noted Dave White, GH Power CEO.Ballard Power Systems Inc.

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most historic stock indexes in America, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world. It was set up in 1896 and holds a central place in the history of the stock market as a result. This also lends the index a special status where the stocks that are included in it are called blue chip stocks, which alludes to their high value and overall stability.Stocks included in the Dow index do not stay there forever. The index in its current form which is limited to 30 stocks came into being in 1928 when it was expanded to reflect the roaring market conditions of the time. This time period was one of the most prosperous in the early history of the Dow index, as 1928 marked an eight year bull run that had started in 1920. It started after the end of the first world war which had left an economic recession in the United States and it would end with much worse economic circumstances coming in as the Great Depression would start. In terms of percentage point drops in economic activity, the Great Depression would be fifteen times as bad as the contraction during the Great Recession after the economic crisis in 2008. Like the housing crisis, the Great Depression also began in the U.S. and then spread all over the world, with stocks believed to have lost more than three quarters of value during the time period.After the Great Depression, the next period of turbulence in the Dow would come during the 1970s when the U.S. shifted away from gold and Saudi Arabia led an oil embargo that led to severe inflation all across America along with dropping economic growth as the pumps dried up. The stock market, which as a whole relies on economic growth and prosperity, does not like any turbulence in either the oil supply or the economy, and as a result, the Dow did poorly. The index would continue to withstand turmoil during the next couple of decades, and with the turn of the millennium, it would lag the losses of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 during the time when the devastating September 11 attacks shook markets.Story continuesThe index's history has also seen several companies come and go. The longest running component of the Dow index is believed to be General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric is one of the oldest companies in America, and it was part of the original Dow index of 1896. Keeping its place in the list of elite stocks for 122 years, the firm exited the Dow in 2018. True to its name the ""Dow Jones 'Industrial' Average,"" most of the original constituents of the Dow were industrial companies. However, its reshaping has been influenced by trends in the broader U.S. economy, with the latest additions being some of the most consequential firms of today such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The chairman and managing director of the Dow Indices index's committee Mr. David Blitzer was cognizant of the evolutionary dynamics in the stock market at the time of GE's de-listing, as he commented:Since then [1907] the U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.Right now, five out of the 30 stocks in the Dow index are information technology firms, making it the largest sector in the index. After tech, the largest sector in the index is financial services, and together, the pair represent nine out of the 30 companies in the Dow. Currently, the oldest member of the index is The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which was added in 1932 and the three youngest additions are Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). According to S&amp;P Dow Jones, the change was prompted after Apple split its shares four to one, which ended up affecting the index's weights.Taking stock of the Dow's performance this year, the index has gained a modest 2.91%, which reflects the mixed performance in the U.S. economy. While technology stocks have soared, other areas such as regional banking and real estate haven't fared so well.

In a first-of-its-kind solution, ComEd purchases its clean energy supply from Constellation, the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy and a leading competitive retail supplier of power and energy products and services.""We are combatting climate change by making our electric grid more resilient and enabling the growth of renewables and electric vehicles, but just as importantly, we are leading by example by driving carbon emissions out of our own operations,"" said Gil Quiniones, CEO, ComEd. ""As the largest electric company in Illinois, it is our duty to take full advantage of the opportunities now available to reduce the use of fossil fuels in our facilities to improve air quality in all of the communities where we operate and where our employees live and work.""Constellation was chosen through a competitive procurement conducted by ComEd for retail electric service. It provides ComEd with clean energy sourced from within the regional electric grid with most of it produced in the ComEd service territory. This carbon-free energy will match ComEd’s total energy usage on an hourly basis. This 100% hourly match is the first deployment of its kind in Illinois and enables ComEd to directly support the state’s clean energy resources.""We applaud ComEd for leading by example and demonstrating that hourly carbon-free energy matching is both achievable today and essential to mitigating the climate crisis,"" said Jim McHugh, executive vice president and chief commercial officer, Constellation. ""A growing number of large commercial and industrial customers are recognizing that matching clean energy production with when they are using their electricity represents the best path to reaching carbon reduction goals. Importantly, this agreement also affirms the critical role of nuclear energy in enabling the viability of hourly carbon-free energy.""Story continuesThe agreement applies to ComEd’s 54 facilities in northern Illinois, including corporate and regional headquarters, reporting centers, business offices, training and special use facilities and substations. ComEd’s clean energy purchase will meet its annual energy use of about 65,000 megawatt hours. In addition to the hourly energy, ComEd will purchase the environmental attributes associated with that energy, ensuring that the power used by its facilities is generated locally by carbon-free generation resources.ComEd’s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint also include going electric with more of its own fleet vehicles. ComEd plans to electrify 30 percent of its fleet by 2025. This will eliminate 2,000 metric tons of GHG emissions, in addition to the 4,000 metric tons that the ComEd fleet already avoids annually. The company’s goal of electrifying 50 percent of its fleet by 2030 has the potential to eliminate an additional 29,000 metric tons of GHG emissions. ComEd will replace end-of-life internal combustion vehicles with plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, reducing fuel and maintenance costs and creating savings that benefit customers. By 2025, ComEd will replace light duty vehicles (LDVs) approaching the end of their life cycle with electric vehicles and by 2030 all LDVs will be electric.ComEd also conducts one of the nation’s largest energy efficiency programs, which offers residents, businesses, and the public sector ways to control energy use and costs. Since 2008, the program has saved customers approximately $7.65 billion on their electric bills. Customers have also saved more than 70 million net megawatt-hours of electricity, which is the annual equivalent to reducing 60 billion pounds of carbon emissions from the atmosphere, removing 6 million cars from the road, and powering more than 8 million ComEd customers’ homes for one year.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures decreased 2.3% to close at $81.25 per barrel, while natural gas prices dropped 7.9% to end at $2.55 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).In particular, the crude price action turned negative for the first time in eight weeks on concerns over demand in China and the possibility of more rate hikes in the near future. A stronger greenback also plagued the dollar-denominated commodity.Meanwhile, natural gas performed worse as the heat wave in parts of the United States dissipated even as production remained robust.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.  Energy infrastructure provider Crestwood Equity Partners LP signed an agreement with larger rival Energy Transfer LP ET to divest its stock in an all-equity transaction valued at $7.1 billion.In recent years, the U.S. energy sector has witnessed intensified buying and selling after significant profits left producers exceptionally wealthy. The importance of pipeline networks continued to increase due to the need to connect remote wells to export facilities. Notably, energy companies are acquiring stakes in pipeline companies to neutralize declines in their hydrocarbon businesses.Per the terms of the deal, Crestwood common unitholders will receive 2.07 Energy Transfer common units for each of its common units. Once the deal closes, Crestwood unitholders will own 6.5% of Energy Transfer’s outstanding common units. (Crestwood Signs Deal to Divest Stakes in All-Stock Deal)2. Houston, TX-based upstream energy company SilverBow Resources, has agreed to buy Chesapeake Energy’s remaining assets in the Eagle Ford Shale for $700 million. The deal, which is strategically aligned with SilverBow's long-term goals, is set to fortify the company’s presence in South Texas and bolster its foothold in the prolific shale play.The acquisition is seen as an important development for SBOW that enhances the company's operational reach and underscores its commitment to extracting value from strategic resources. The transaction — likely to close by this year-end — encompasses approximately 42,000 acres in Dimmit and Webb counties, adding to SilverBow’s already robust inventory.The purchase price of $700 million is structured as a $650 million upfront cash payment plus a $50 million deferred cash payment due 12 months after the deal concludes. SilverBow's financing plan encompasses a combination of cash reserves, borrowings under the company's credit agreements, and incremental commitments from lenders. In fact, SBOW has secured an extra $425 million under its credit facility to fund the deal. (SilverBow's South Texas Asset Buy Streak Continues)3.  Natural gas producer EQT Corporation and private equity firm Quantum Energy Partners’ $5.2-billion cash-and-stock merger faces antitrust concerns. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) recently approved a consent order in an attempt to address these apprehensions. The consent order forbids the two companies from cooperating and exchanging confidential, competitively sensitive information.In the Appalachian Basin — the largest natural gas-producing region in the United States — Quantum and EQT are direct competitors in the production and sale of natural gas. According to the FTC, permitting Quantum CEO VanLoh to join the board of EQT would result in an illegal overlap for companies that directly compete with one another to produce and sell natural gas from the Appalachian Basin.The FTC's consent order provides profound structural relief by prohibiting Quantum from holding an EQT board position, requiring Quantum to sell its EQT shares, forbidding the sharing of anticompetitive information, dissolving a separate anticompetitive joint venture between the two parties and imposing additional restrictions to safeguard competition. (EQT-Quantum Energy Deal Faces FTC Check to Protect Competition)4.   Pipeline company Magellan Midstream Partners has taken a significant step to engage investors toward its pending merger with another midstream firm ONEOK, Inc. In this context, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) partnership has started sending informative materials to its unitholders outlining the key details and merits of the proposed transaction. This is aimed at encouraging them to cast their votes in favor of the merger before the scheduled special meeting next month.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The proposed transaction involves ONEOK's acquisition of all outstanding units of MMP through a mixture of cash and stock. Per the terms of the deal, Magellan Midstream unitholders stand to receive $25 in cash and 0.667 units of ONEOK common stock for each MMP common unit held.The materials being dispatched to unitholders are comprehensive in nature and contain an overview of the tax implications considered by Magellan before approving the merger. To make things clearer and transparent, a video featuring president and CEO Aaron Milford discussing the advantages of the transaction and its alignment with MMP’s goals has been made available.

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate Akamai's financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release is non-GAAP net income per diluted share.Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects Akamai's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as it facilitates comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enables investors to evaluate Akamai's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. The non-GAAP net income per diluted share metric may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of Akamai's ongoing operating results.This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of Akamai's GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Akamai's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Akamai has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This reconciliation captioned ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" can be found on the Investor Relations section of Akamai's website.Akamai provides forward-looking statements in the form of guidance during its quarterly earnings conference calls. This guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis and cannot be reconciled to the closest GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because of the unpredictability of the amounts and timing of events affecting the items we exclude from non-GAAP measures. For example, stock-based compensation is unpredictable for Akamai's performance-based awards, which can fluctuate significantly based on current expectations of future achievement of performance-based targets. Amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are all impacted by the timing and size of potential future actions, which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, Akamai excludes certain items that occur infrequently, which are also inherently difficult to predict and estimate. It is also difficult to predict the tax effect of the items we exclude and to estimate certain discrete tax items, such as the resolution of tax audits or changes to tax laws. As such, the costs that are being excluded from non-GAAP guidance are difficult to predict and a reconciliation or a range of results could lead to disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of the exclusions could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.Akamai's definition of the non-GAAP measure used in this press release is outlined below:Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, or EPS – Non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to Akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of $1,100 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 and $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, the Company would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2029, 2027 and 2025, unless Akamai's weighted average stock price is greater than $126.31, $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.Non-GAAP net income – GAAP net income adjusted for the following tax-affected items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; amortization of debt issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses from equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.The non-GAAP adjustments, and Akamai's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Akamai has incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions Akamai has made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each acquisition; therefore, Akamai excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation – Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to Akamai's employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of Akamai's current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, Akamai believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of Akamai's core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate its performance and compare its operating results to peer companies.Acquisition-related costs – Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities, as well as certain additional compensation costs payable to employees acquired from the Linode acquisition if employed for a certain period of time. The additional compensation cost was initiated by and determined by the seller, and is in addition to normal levels of compensation, including retention programs, offered by Akamai. Acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and Akamai excludes acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect Akamai's core operations.Restructuring charge – Akamai has incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by the Company or the manner in which that business is conducted. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts canceled as part of these programs. Akamai excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.Amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense – In August 2023, Akamai issued $1,100 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 with a coupon interest rate of 1.125%. In August 2019, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%. In May 2018, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. The issuance costs of the convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from Akamai's non-GAAP results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.Gains and losses on investments – Akamai has recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. Akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of Akamai's core business operations and ongoing operating performanceIncome and losses from equity method investment – Akamai records income or losses on its share of earnings and losses from its equity method investment. Akamai excludes such income and losses because it does not have direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of its core business operations.Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items – The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. Akamai believes that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows Akamai to highlight income attributable to its core operations.Akamai Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform ActThis release and/or our quarterly earnings conference call scheduled for later today contain statements that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements about expected future financial performance, expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai.

The COVID-19 pandemic revealed disparities in digital equity, and Comcast responded by bringing Lift Zones to education and community centers.“Access to high-speed internet and digital skills training is no longer a luxury, but a necessity, making connectivity more important than ever.

256,87d8fccb-aec4-3ac7-b6eb-7bbadbafc1b0,CMCSA,2023-08-25,The Transformative Power of the Affordable Connectivity Program,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transformative-power-affordable-connectivity-program-191500229.html,1692904500,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 24, 2023 / Comcast CorporationThis week, the federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) announced a new milestone. Launched nearly two years ago, it has now connected more than 20 million households to the Internet. This is a remarkable achievement and we at Comcast are proud to participate in the program. The ACP provides families with a $30/month benefit, $75/month on Tribal lands, toward their Internet bill.When applied to Comcast's Internet Essentials or Internet Essentials Plus tiers, it makes connectivity to the Internet effectively free. However, we still face the challenge of getting millions more ACP-eligible households to enroll. Great progress is being made to close the digital divide, but too many families, in communities across the nation, have yet to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation opportunity.Since day one, Comcast has been working to raise awareness about the ACP, and we are investing in hundreds of non-profit partners because closing that divide cannot be achieved without collaboration. For this reason, we are supporting Digital Navigators - people who teach digital skills at the neighborhood level - because we know they are key to the trust-building necessary for success.A great example of that kind of partnership is our commitment as a founding partner of the Online For All campaign with Civic Nation and the U.S. Department of Education. Together with other companies and the federal government, this coalition is working aggressively to enroll even more eligible Americans in the ACP.From our headquarters in Philadelphia, to Houston, Portland, Atlanta, and beyond, I have personally met with dozens and dozens of parents, students, seniors, veterans, and entrepreneurs who have had their lives transformed by an Internet connection, especially one that is home-based.A high school student who found scholarships to pay for college. A single mother who completed a job training program. A senior who now schedules her own telemedicine appointments from the comfort of home.Story continuesWhat do these three people have in common? They were all connected to the Internet because of the ACP. Here are their stories:Llulisa - Philadelphia, PAAs a high-school student who was not connected to the Internet at home, Llulisa had to get to school early or stay late to use the WiFi to do her homework. During the pandemic, she worried she might not be able to stay on track and keep her grades up so she could apply to college. Fortunately, Llulisa's brother heard about Comcast's Internet Essentials program at a local community center and helped their mom sign up for Internet service at home. The family has since enrolled in the ACP and their home Internet service is now fully covered by the benefit. Today, Llulisa is proud to be the first person in her family to go to college, and she is well on her way to fulfilling her dream of becoming an immigration lawyer.Alisha - Eastern Shore, MDAs a single mother of two children, Alisha is not only using the Internet to help her sons with schoolwork and college applications, but she's also using it to pursue her own career growth. Alisha recently completed a healthcare certification course with our partners at Goodwill, in part by using her home Internet connection. Alisha credits the ACP with helping her more effectively juggle raising her children, working, and volunteering in her local community. Not only has the ACP benefited her, but it also helped her son, who is now enrolled at Delaware State University. In her words, ""the Internet is as essential as the air we breathe."" Having it at home has helped make a big difference for her and her family.Gayla - Houston, TXDuring a holiday event in Houston, Gayla received a free laptop from Comcast. Instead of keeping it for herself, however, she gave it to her 87-year-old mother and helped her enroll in the ACP. With her new computer and Internet connection, Gayla's mother can now participate in telemedicine appointments without having to spend hours navigating public transportation to get across town and back. In addition, she can stay in better contact with friends and family from the comfort of her home, which brings her joy every day.These three individuals are just a few of the millions of students, families, and others who have been positively impacted by the ACP. Whether it's improving economic mobility through education, accessing telehealth and telemedicine, or simply enjoying all the news, weather, and entertainment the Internet puts at our fingertips, it's undeniable that having the Internet at home, a computer, and the skills to use it are truly life changing.Unfortunately, the success of the ACP is causing an emerging dilemma. The $14 billion allocated to the FCC to provide vouchers to eligible households is likely to be exhausted early next year.

The company is now adding 25 new free channels, which include shows like Top Gear, Baywatch and several game shows. It will also include music channels, multicultural entertainment and many more.The latest move follows the company’s recent step regarding the inclusion of over 800 live TV and free TV channels like Tubi, Plex, Haystack News, NBC, ABC, CBS and FOX, to name a few. The lineup also includes channels featuring shows like Westworld, Law &amp; Order: SVU and The Walking Dead.Currently, there are 100 free built-in channels on Google TV, thanks to these additions.Along with the addition of 25 more channels, Google is also integrating YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket into Google TV this season in the United States. This is expected to drive Google and gain momentum among football lovers.Alphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. Price and ConsensusAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. QuoteGrowth ProspectsWith its growing free streaming offering, Google is well-poised to capitalize on the growing demand for free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) and channels.Due to high inflation, customers are cutting down on their discretionary spending, which in turn is hurting the subscriber base of paid streaming services. The preference and adoption rate of free streaming services are on the rise.Coming to other Google TV initiatives, the integration of more than 30 streaming services into Google TV to provide access to several contents from the services in one place remains noteworthy.With this integration, users can stream content not only from YouTube TV and Google TV but also from Disney’s Disney+, Amazon’s AMZN Prime Video, Hulu, HBO Max, HBO Go, Comcast’s CMCSA Peacock, Comedy Central, Pluto TV, Viki/Rakuten, Fox Now, Paramount+ and ABC, to name a few.Google strives to deliver an enhanced video streaming experience to its users with the abovementioned efforts. This, in turn, is expected to accelerate the adoption rate of Google TV in the near term, which is likely to aid the performance of the Google Services segment.Google Services contributes the most to Alphabet’s top line.Revenues from the Google Services business increased 5.5% year over year to $66.3 billion, accounting for 88.8% of the total third-quarter revenues. Our model projects the segment’s revenues at $267.05 billion for 2023, reflecting a rise of 5.3% from 2022’s level.With consistent efforts, Alphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), remains well-poised to rapidly penetrate the booming global video-streaming market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Per a Precedence Research report, the underlined market is expected to reach $1.7 trillion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 18.5% between 2022 and 2030.Solid prospects of GOOGL in this booming market are likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.The stock has returned 50% on a year-to-date basis.Story continuesCompetitive ScenarioLike Google, Roku ROKU recently announced a collaboration with Comcast-owned NBCUniversal (“NBCU”) to bring new FAST linear content offerings to The Roku Channel. These offerings include a variety of fan-favorite programming from the NBCU Global Distribution library.This collaboration between Roku and NBCUniversal aims to provide viewers with a wide range of popular content options, expanding the offerings available on The Roku Channel.Meanwhile, Amazon offers a completely free streaming service with thousands of hit movies, shows and Originals called Amazon Freevee, which is an ad-supported video-on-demand streaming service.Nevertheless, Alphabet’s deepening focus on strengthening its FAST will likely continue to bolster its competitive position against the above-mentioned peers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: PRU) announced today that it is partnering with the next generation of tennis talent – 19-year-old Ethan Quinn – in a brand deal that showcases Ethan at a new stage in his life: Preparing for competition as he makes his professional debut and thinking about…retirement.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230824801546/en/Image from Prudential's new ad partnering with Ethan Quinn (Photo: Business Wire)Ethan will utilize Prudential Stages for Retirement and Prudential’s team of financial advisors to let his money work for him as he builds his tennis career. Through the power of compound interest, the investment could be worth as much as $2.6 million – nearly the value of winning a tennis title championship – when he is eligible for retirement.""Ethan understands that the training and hard work pays off in more than one way, and is partnering with Prudential to inspire others to seize the moments when life goes right to plan for a better financial future,"" said Susan Somersille Johnson, Prudential’s Chief Marketing Officer. ""No matter what happens throughout his professional career – Ethan will be ready. And Prudential will be there to support him.""This is important, says Prudential Financial Advisor and former professional football player Delvin Joyce. By planning now, Ethan can face his financial future with the same confidence he brings to the court.""Earning a lot of money when young can create a false sense of security,"" Joyce said. ""Professional athletes are typically well compensated but are not taught how to manage their wealth. Ethan understands this, and wants to encourage young players to consider their financial future as their career begins, not when it is ending.""Story continuesAs part of the brand deal, Ethan will star in an ad directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green. The ad is the latest in Prudential’s ‘Now What?’ brand campaign and will premiere on national TV at the same time as the US Open Aug. 28-Sept. 10. It features a variety of inspiring moments: Ethan at center court of a large-scale stadium. Sitting on the sidelines. Walking down the tunnel. Preparing in the locker room. Near the end, he’s preparing for a serve, and hitting it across the net in what is now the exciting and defining moment of the rest of his life. The voice-over describes Ethan as an underdog, a long shot, a first timer. But it also describes him as ‘something that not too many people ever get to be. A professional.’Green, a former college athlete who directed such iconic films as Monsters and Men, King Richard, and the upcoming Bob Marley: One Love, says his background in sports was one of the primary reasons he decided to sign on as director of the ad.""I wish I understood the importance of saving my pennies when I was a young man starting out,"" Green said. ""Although I was raised to live in the moment, to be present, and that any day could be my last, I hope this ad inspires young people to save for the rainy and sunny days and create a plan for what’s to come.""The brand deal with Ethan, which will also be supported by paid digital and social media, is in addition to a global campaign for Prudential’s global investment management division (PGIM) in partnership with Cam Norrie, the world’s #13 tennis player and the British #1. PGIM will be prominently featured on Cam’s shirt sleeve when he competes in the Australian Open, the French Open, the US Open and Wimbledon.

262,4c1e437f-6065-3a59-920b-050a27c9100b,DVN,2023-08-25,Is Weakness In Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-devon-energy-corporation-nyse-140023501.html,1692885623,STORY,['DVN'],"[With its stock down 7.1% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Devon Energy's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:43% = US$4.8b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.43 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 43% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Devon Energy has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 28% which is quite remarkable. So, the substantial 57% net income growth seen by Devon Energy over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Devon Energy's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 28%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Devon Energy is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Devon Energy Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The three-year median payout ratio for Devon Energy is 49%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 51%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Devon Energy is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.Additionally, Devon Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 26% over the next three years. Regardless, the future ROE for Devon Energy is predicted to decline to 23% despite the anticipated decrease in the payout ratio. We reckon that there could probably be other factors that could be driving the forseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Devon Energy's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase P10's shares before the 30th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 20th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.033 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.12 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, P10 has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current stock price of $12.23. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for P10 Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. P10 distributed an unsustainably high 110% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious.When a company pays out a dividend that is not well covered by profits, the dividend is generally seen as more vulnerable to being cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see P10's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 50% per annum for the past five years.Story continuesGiven that P10 has only been paying a dividend for a year, there's not much of a past history to draw insight from.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid P10? P10 has been generating credible earnings per share growth, although its dividend payments were not adequately covered by earnings. We're unconvinced on the company's merits, and think there might be better opportunities out there.If you want to look further into P10, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. We've identified 4 warning signs with P10 (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable), and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then check out 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks in 2023. August 2023 is a crucial month as the stock market pours over the countless earnings reports for the second calendar quarter. The first half of the year saw mega technology cap stocks soar to record high levels, fueled by heightened optimism and expectations about artificial intelligence. At the same time, the fresh earnings report allowed investors and analysts to gauge the impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes on corporate operations, and the dropping inflation's effects on revenues and consumer spending power.The first two technology giants to report earnings this season were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both, like some of their other peers, are at the top of the recent AI wave. Meta, which owns Facebook, is expected to significantly benefit from artificial intelligence when it comes to providing users with advertisements and content recommendations based on their previous Facebook use and preferences in general. Facebook also announced a new artificial intelligence model in August through which it aims to enable users who speak different languages to communicate with each other.On the earnings front, Meta reported $2.98 in adjusted earnings per share which marked a 16% annual growth. Revenue for the firm stood at $31.9 billion after growing by 11% annually. The earnings report also provided details about Meta's costly bet on the metaverse which not only saw the firm plow billions of dollars into the technology last year but also change its name to reflect the change. This bet came at the wrong time as far as the stock market was concerned, as investors were looking for cost cutting at a time of high interest rates and high inflation. This led to Meta's shares being one of the worst performing stocks in 2022, but the shares have roared back to life this year as they are up by 136% year to date.Story continuesMicrosoft, which is another firm at the heart of the AI wave, grew its revenue by 8% annually as it reported $56.2 billion in net sales. However, the firm's guidance for the current quarter failed to impress investors and its shares slipped on the stock market as a result. Alphabet's results were far more impressive than Microsoft's as the firm beat analyst revenue estimates and posted $74.6 billion in revenue to mark a 7% annual growth.Finally, the remaining two tech titans, namely Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed a mixed bag of results that reflected the current economic turmoil and uncertainty. Starting off with Apple, the largest technology company in the world relied on its services segment to beat top and bottom line analyst estimates. However, Apple, which relies on high end, premium products to earn its keep, saw its revenue drop by 1% annually with its hardware segment leading the drop as consumers felt a pinch to their purchasing power. Amazon, on the other hand, roared on the same day that Apple sounded a bit meek, as it beat analyst estimates for both revenue and net income and also surpassed the guidance estimates for the current quarter.As to why Amazon managed to thrive in a tough consumer economy, here's what the firm's management had to say during the earnings call for the quarter:Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores’ fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn’t matter much to customers.This argument is incorrect. There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It’s also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There’s a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms.So which are the most profitable technology companies in 2023?

266,10cf11da-4505-40ab-8beb-58435435701c,ORCL,2023-08-25,Nvidia to Wall Street: What supply problems?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-to-wall-street-what-supply-problems-190144711.html,1692903704,STORY,"['NVDA', 'META', 'AMZN', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'ORCL', 'MSFT']","[Nvidia (NVDA) reported blowout second quarter results Wednesday, crushing Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom line. But perhaps the most important news came during the company’s earnings call when CFO Colette Kress attempted to assuage investors’ concerns about a supply crunch and the impact of further US sanctions against China.Nvidia, Kress told analysts, is well positioned on both fronts.“Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs,” Kress said. “We have also developed and qualified additional capacities and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process.”According to Kress, Nvidia expects supplies to increase each quarter through next year, which should help the company meet the massive ramp-up in demand it’s experiencing as the AI craze continues to pick up steam.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holds the Grace hopper system at COMPUTEX 2023. (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)In the latest quarter, Q2, Nvidia’s revenue jumped some 101% year over year to $13.5 billion, while earnings per share rose 429% to $2.70. And demand isn’t slowing, as the company said it expects to bring in $16 billion in revenue in the current quarter, plus or minus 2%. That’s well ahead of analysts’ forecast of $12.5 billion.Kress also hit on whether additional US sanctions on selling high-end chips to China would take a bite out of Nvidia’s revenue moving forward: She said the company shouldn’t face any problems.“We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results given the strength of demand for our products worldwide,” Kress said. “We do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our data center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact or financial results.”Proving the big names are still buyingIn addition to tamping down on fears that Nvidia could face an inventory shortfall — or that it will be hurt by increasing tensions between the US and China — Kress pointed to a number of big-name companies that continue to buy up Nvidia’s products.“Data center … revenue nearly tripled year on year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer internet companies,” she said.Story continues“Major companies including AWS (AMZN), Google Cloud (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Oracle Cloud (ORCL), as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers, are deploying, in volume, HDX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture tensor core GPUs.”Sign up for the Yahoo Finance newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)As for how long Nvidia can keep up this kind of growth, CEO Jensen Huang pointed to the enormity of the global data center market — and the need for companies to lean further into accelerated computing and AI.“There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it a quarter of a trillion dollars of capital spent each year. You're seeing that the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of computing today: accelerated computing and generative AI,” Huang said.“This is not a near-term thing. This is a long-term industry transition. And we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time,” he added.Nvidia, though, needs to ensure it can hold on to its lead in the chip space throughout that transition. But with rivals AMD, Intel, and others looking to topple the AI giant, that could be a difficult task.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

267,db242da0-4e1b-380c-b67d-7a3ad5bbf44a,ORCL,2023-08-25,"2 Stocks With Bullish ""Shakeout"" Patterns",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-bullish-shakeout-patterns-141000763.html,1692886200,STORY,"['ORCL', 'YPF']","[A “shakeout” refers to a sudden and sharp decrease in the price of a stock or market, followed by an equally quick recovery. The shakeout phenomenon is characterized by the initial plunge in the stock, which causes panic selling among inexperienced investors or “weak hands”. Shakeouts can occur due to various factors such as negative news, economic uncertainty, geopolitical events, a “fat finger” (accidental trade), or for no reason at all (the market is the master manipulator).Regardless of the reason, shakeouts tend to have three key traits, including:·      A Wide Price Range: The price spread (low and high of the day or week) should be the widest in months.·      Heavy volume: Because inexperienced investors puke their shares and savvy investors use the flush as an opportunity to scoop up shares at a discount, volume should be well above the average.·      Engulfing Candle/Undercut: A shakeout is incomplete until the price undercuts a critical zone, such as a recent range or moving average.Shakeout ExampleIn late October of 2022, stock futures got crushed on news that inflation had soared to more than 40-year highs. The perceived bad news turned out to be priced in, and the shakeout marked the bottom. The Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) went as low as $254 on the session before reversing course and finishing at $268.82, up 2.35% on volume 95% above the 50-day average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewBullish Shakeout Candidate #1 Oracle (ORCL)ShakeoutZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewOverviewZacks Rank #2 (Buy) Stock Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware, and application software providers. In recent years, Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations dramatically. The company offers cloud solutions and services that are used to build and manage various cloud deployment models. Oracle also entered the hardware business after acquiring Sun Microsystems several years ago.Story continuesBenefitting from the AI RevolutionOracle is likely to continue to grow rapidly due to the AI revolution. The company offers AI-driven solutions and tools to help businesses integrate machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics into their applications and processes – something almost every big tech company is rushing to do.13F Shows Smart Money is Entering the StockLegendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller has famously never had a down year in more than 30 years of investing. Druckenmiller’s 13F disclosure shows that ORCL is a new buy for him.  Cloud Business GrowthOracle is gaining ground in its largest business as enterprises increasingly transition to the cloud. Juggernauts such as MercadoLibre (MELI) and Zoom Video (ZM) have already chosen ORCL for their cloud infrastructure needs, and many are likely to follow. ORCL’s SaaS application business alone produced an annualized revenue of $6.2 billion and grew by 25% last year.Steady Mover Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft (MSFT) or Amazon (AMZN). Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&amp;P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the ideal combination for investors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBullish Shakeout Candidate #2YPF Sociedad Anonima (YPF)ShakeoutZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewOverviewYPF Sociedad Anonima is an Argentine energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining, and distribution. YPF is a state-owned company with a significant position in the country’s energy industry.CatalystsObviously, the most significant catalyst for YPF would be for energy prices to continue to rise. With the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve at its lowest level in decades, supply cuts from OPEC, and no end in sight to the war in Ukraine, higher energy prices seem like a reality. Another potential catalyst is a change in government. Currently, four in ten people in Argentina suffer from poverty. However, in the recent primary election, a libertarian candidate delivered a surprise win, and the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT) and the Argentine stock market had a bullish shakeout.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: TradingViewBottom LineDuring a shakeout, weaker and more speculative investors tend to panic and sell their holdings, causing an initial price decline. However, this process can clear out the market of these unstable participants, leaving behind a more resilient investor base.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list and skip our introduction to the real estate industry then take a look at 5 Most Undervalued REIT Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The real estate industry is one of the most watched sectors these days. Like the banking industry, it is also highly sensitive to interest rates, and naturally, construction and real estate management firms have seen a vastly different operating environment these days after the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes.However, not all real estate firms are equal when it comes to disruption from the high interest rates. In fact, the home building industry has been one of the strongest sectors this year and one that has been pushed to the background only because of the strong performance of technology stocks. As an illustration, the S&amp;P Homebuilders Select Industry Index has appreciated by 31.7% year to date, posting nearly twice the gains of the S&amp;P500 index which has appreciated by 16% this year. Adding to this strong performance, hedge funds are cognizant of the reality as well. As the second quarter of 2023 hedge fund SEC filings started to flow in, they also included a nice surprise for the home building industry. This surprise came in the form of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway scooping up $814 million of shares in NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR), Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) - some of the largest home building companies in America. Mr. Buffett's big stake investment came as the firms smartly navigated the high rate environment by leveraging the high margins they had secured for themselves during the high demand of the coronavirus pandemic to offer buyers lower mortgage rates even as interest rates stand at multi year high levels. For more details about the construction industry, you should check out 15 Biggest Construction Companies in the World.Story continuesThe booming and bustling of residential real estate has not unfortunately translated into other segments. One of the worst performing real estate segments this year is office real estate. These projects often require significantly higher investments than home building projects, and these require large scale financing and hundreds of millions of dollars in debt that has to be repaid for decades. So any turbulence in the economy or working conditions ripples through to office firms and real estate management trusts (REITs) and this has been the case this year as well. Office loans crossed a 5% delinquency rate in July, as it nearly tripled over the year ago figures. Office real estate companies are facing troubles on multiple fronts. For starters, the high interest rates, and the uncertainty surrounding a terminal rate that prevailed last year, made securing credit and loans for large projects difficult. To add to this, the high rates also make it difficult to repay debt, and as if this weren't enough, office workers are not returning to work as quickly as expected, leaving many buildings vacant and their owners seeing the corresponding revenue drops.In fact, a growing trend in the industry is seeing office firms find other uses for their buildings. For instance, the Boston Planning and Development Agency is running a test program to see how well office buildings can serve as residential units. The incentive for the office real estate firms to make this switch comes in the form of a reduced tax rate, as the residential buildings will be taxed at $10.74 per $1,000 of assessed value as compared to the $24.68 per $1,000 as before. Then, for the next 29, the properties will be able to avail a 75% tax discount  - so it looks to be quite a sweet deal for office real estate firms operating in downtown Boston. The bulk of the benefits under this program should apply to older Class B and Class C properties that have struggled to regain footing after the coronavirus shock. Additionally, the older buildings might actually be quite suitable for conversion to residential use, according to Suzanne Lanyi Charles, an architect and a professor at Cornell University's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning (AAP).The turmoil in the debt of office real estate investment trusts was at the center of debate during the earnings call of Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE:AHT) where management shared:During the quarter, we made significant progress on our loan extensions and made the strategic decision not to make required pay downs on our keys A, B, and F loan pools in order to meet those extension debt yield tests. This was a prudent economic decision that reflected a comprehensive capital management process by the company, which explored and assessed multiple options for these assets, including refinancing, extensions, and asset sales. Importantly, the recent amendment to our corporate financing provides us with added flexibility regarding these loan pools and by proactively choosing not to extend three of those pools, we will improve our balance sheet by lowering leverage and it materially improves our future cash flows. Further, the combination of the pay downs and the ultimate removal of the debt associated with the pools that we did not extend, will lower our debt by approximately $700 million or more than 18%. We have been committed to deleveraging the company over time, and this is a significant step towards our long-term goals of creating a more sustainable capital structure. Additionally, capital recycling remains an important component of our strategy and we continue to pursue opportunities to sell certain non-core assets.Today, we'll take a look at some undervalued REIT stocks being bought by hedge funds, with the notable picks being Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), Starwood Property Trust, Inc.

In a campaign video released on Truth Social, Trump vowed to support ""a law to keep politics away from Americans’ retirement accounts forever.”“ESG as a term has become demonized,” Sosnick said. “Companies probably won't change their fundamental values but I think they'll change the way that it's expressed.” For example, McDonald’s (MCD) removed the ESG abbreviation from parts of its website earlier this year.Staying tough on ChinaDespite offering few details on how to manage the US’s relationship with China, GOP candidates have largely taken an aggressive stance towards Beijing, leading investors to believe tensions will remain high for years to come.DeSantis has called the US’s current relationship with China ‘abusive.’ Ramaswamy said economic independence from China is the ‘most important foreign policy objective.’ Former UN ambassador, and South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley accused China of ‘taking advantage of America and using our science and tech to advance its military.’ Even Senator Tim Scott, who has been criticized by rivals for being too friendly towards Beijing, is stepping up his rhetoric.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -3.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, which Micron falls in, has lost 0.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post a loss of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of -182.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$4.56 points to a change of -154.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.52 indicates a change of +66.7% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Micron is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -41.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.44 billion and $20.08 billion estimates indicate -49.8% and +30.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $3.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -56.6%. EPS of -$1.43 for the same period compares with $2.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.99%. The EPS surprise was +9.49%.Over the last four quarters, Micron surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The COVID-19 outbreak crippled the industry as sales came to a standstill in early 2020.The industry has since bounced back and has been putting up a great show amid inflationary pressures. Although higher costs have made people spend cautiously, it really hasn’t impacted sales much at restaurants. Given this situation, stocks like Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC, McDonald's Corporation MCD, Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. TAST, Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ and BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI are likely to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales Grow SteadilySales at U.S. bars and restaurants totaled $91.1 billion in July, increasing 1.4% month over month, according to the National Restaurant Association (NRA). Sales at U.S. restaurants have now increased for the third consecutive month. Sales rose 1.6% in May and 0.8% in June. On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 4.4% in July.The retail sector is making a solid effort to bounce back as inflationary pressures continue to impact sales. However, sales have continued to multiply at restaurants as consumers aren’t hesitant to spend more on eating out. This bodes well for the restaurant industry.In the retail sector, the Zacks Defined Restaurant Industry is presently ranked in the upper 19% among all industries, boasting a year-to-date return of 5.3%.According to the NRA, the restaurant industry is on track for solid growth in 2023. The food service industry is projected to reach $997 billion in sales this year. Moreover, the workforce at U.S. restaurants is projected to increase by 50,000 jobs, which is likely to take the total industry employment to 15.5 million by the end of this year.Several factors are driving sales in the restaurant industry. This can be attributed to fundamental factors like shifts in operational methods, workforce changes, layout enhancements and technological progress.Story continuesRestaurant proprietors are also shifting focus toward digital innovations, sales enhancement strategies, and cost-effective initiatives. The growing influence of the Internet has made digital evolution indispensable. Also, notable restaurant chains are continuously partnering with delivery services and digital platforms to generate supplementary revenues.Also, inflation has been steadily declining over the past year, having more than halved from its 9.1% peak in June 2022. The Fed has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.The monetary tightening policy has helped bring down inflation substantially, which has raised hopes that the Fed could finally end its interest rate hike campaign. Lower borrowing gives consumers more purchasing power, which is likely to further help the restaurant industry.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these five restaurant stocks.Yum China Holdings, Inc.operates both company-owned and franchised restaurants.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.71 billion, up 48.5% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.59 per share and revenue of $6.74 billion.

Many travel stocks, previously bruised and battered, are now recovering early, making them look like undervalued gems. The travel demand isn’t packing its bags anytime soon, and investors are seizing the opportunity to pick up some undervalued stocks to buy for the long haul.Travel is a sector that ebbs and flows with global events, and arguably no event showcased this as glaringly the Covid-19 crisis. For two grueling years, the U.S. watched as some of the most iconic hotels shuttered their windows while majestic aircraft and the once-bustling cruise ships became silent observers across the globe. With that said, here are three of the top undervalued travel stocks to wager on now.TripAdvisor (TRIP)image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comTripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) has long been synonymous with trip planning and candid reviews in the ever-evolving realm of global travel. Yet, like a ship navigating choppy waters, the firm grapples with narrowing margins and a brawl to maintain its dominance. The past decade witnessed its competitive edge in core markets, thanks to rising challengers and a dwindling pool of high-revenue opportunities. Moreover, with their specialized offerings, nimble online travel agents are seemingly sprinting ahead in the growth race.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, every cloud has its silver lining, and for TripAdvisor, it’s their latest financial reveal. The company’s second-quarter press release presented a mixed bag; while the non-GAAP earnings-per-share of 34 cents missed the mark by roughly two cents, the revenue figures painted a bright picture. Raking in $494 million, a commendable 18.5% year-over-year bump, it exceeded expectations by $20.5 million.Moreover, TRIP stock trades at just 1.3 times forward sales, 66% lower than the 5-year median. Additionally, its enterprise-to-sales ratio is at just 1.2, 35.4%, lower than the sector median and 72% lower than the 5-year median.Story continuesExpedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comSitting atop the pyramid of online travel agencies, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) has established its position as a veritable titan. Catering to a wide spectrum of services in the space, Expedia is the digital concierge for countless travelers globally. Moreover, the past year has seen the company pivot with finesse, rolling out strategic cost-saving measures, streamlining operations, and building on its brand equity. Even as the echoes of the pandemic slowly fade, Expedia has penned a travel recovery narrative, cutting down debts and optimizing its workforce.In their second-quarter financial disclosure, the numbers sparkled. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.89 handily surpassed expectations by 53 cents, and a revenue surge to $3.36 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year growth, is just the tip of the iceberg. The narrative is clear, with lodging gross bookings and revenue hitting record highs for any second quarter. And if that wasn’t enough, Tiprank’s recent analysis offers a cherry on top: projecting a potential 20% upside on EXPE stock, crowning it with a ‘Moderate Buy’ rating.American Airlines (AAL)American Airlines plane on ramp in Chicago Airport. American Airlines is amongst the airlines cancelling flightsSource: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.comNavigating through post-pandemic skies, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has effectively delivered a performance that’s difficult to overlook. As the travel bug bit harder this year, American Airlines second-quarter earnings soared, touching the clouds with an earnings-per-share of $1.92, significantly higher than the anticipated $1.59 by industry analysts. Regarding revenue, the company’s figures were equally impressive with $14.06 billion against Wall Street’s forecasted $13.74 billion. Adding to the upbeat rhythm, the flying capacity grew by a promising 5.3% in the same quarter.They’ve optimistically ramped up their forward guidance for 2023, banking on the travel euphoria to sail smoothly into next year. Their sterling second-quarter results mirror the positive winds blowing across the aviation sector. Industry whisperers predict U.S. airlines to be on track to ferry a whopping 257 million passengers in the sunny window between June 1 and August 31. Hence, AAL stock boasts a tremendous bump ahead, with analysts predicting at least a 16% upside from current levels,On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

Shares have added about 1.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Paccar due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.PACCAR Q2 Earnings Beat Estimates on Record RevenuesPACCAR Inc.’s earnings of $2.33 per share for second-quarter 2023 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 and rocketed 70% from the year-ago figure.Consolidated revenues (including trucks and financial services) came in at $8,881 million, up from $7,158.7 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2022. Sales from Trucks, Parts and Others were $8,441.3 million, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,280 million.Key TakeawaysRevenues from the Trucks segment totaled $6,827.5 million in the June quarter, higher than the prior-year quarter’s $5,336.4 million. The figure also crossed our estimate of $5,756.4 million due to higher-than-expected demand for trucks with high fuel efficiency. The segment’s pre-tax income was $948.3 million, outpacing our estimate of $868.6 million and increasing a whopping 125% year over year.Revenues from the Parts segment totaled $1,598.9 million in the reported quarter, increasing from the year-earlier period’s $1,434.7 million and surpassing our estimate of $1,587.7 million. The segment’s pre-tax income came in at $419.3 million, up 18.7% on a year-over-year basis. The metric, however, lagged our estimate of $562.6 million.Revenues of the Financial Services segment came in at $439.8 million compared with the year-ago quarter’s $372.5 million and topped our estimate of $273.3 million due to its high-quality portfolio. Pre-tax income increased to $144.7 million from $144.4 million and came higher than our forecast of $103 million, thanks to its high-quality portfolio and good used truck profitability.Other sales amounted to $14.9 million, surpassing our estimate of $14.5 million. Pretax profit increased to $56.2 million, up from $2.3 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses in second-quarter 2023 increased to $181.9 million, up from $176.8 million in the prior-year period. Research &amp; development (R&amp;D) expenses were $101.3 million compared with the year-earlier quarter’s $80.4 million.PACCAR’s cash and marketable debt securities amounted to $6,618.4 million as of Jun 30, 2023 compared with $6,158.9 million on Dec 31, 2022. The company hiked its dividend by 8% to 27 cents per share, up from 25 cents per share in the prior quarter.Capex and R&amp;D expenses for 2023 are envisioned in the band of $625-$675 million and $400-$430 million, respectively.Story continuesHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresCurrently, Paccar has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Paccar has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

285,bf4182d2-705e-3fc8-b459-5c14df752054,AXP,2023-08-25,Investors Heavily Search American Express Company (AXP): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-american-express-130006721.html,1692882006,STORY,['AXP'],"[American Express (AXP) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned -5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which American Express falls in, has lost 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, American Express is expected to post earnings of $2.99 per share, indicating a change of +21.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.14 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.1%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.51 indicates a change of +12.3% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, American Express is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For American Express, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.44 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $60.91 billion and $66.52 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +9.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Express reported revenues of $15.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.89 for the same period compares with $2.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.34%. The EPS surprise was +3.21%.Over the last four quarters, American Express surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Express. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on managing the elements within our control, reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability and further strengthen our position for long-term success. Looking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-Series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family. Similarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level high-performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience. Building on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-Series, a family of SAN-specific all flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees. These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms. Complementing our unified storage offering, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud. In May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objective appropriately aligned to each team's strength. Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities. The changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion and should help drive top line growth in the second half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion, was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on products and AFA revenue. Additionally, as Mike will outline, the first half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA proven architecture in 2018. Today, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective predictive and generative AI projects depend on high-quality, well-managed unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on-premises, high-performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves. While early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp cloud volume services. Accelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on premises and in the cloud with built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions. Our confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list. Now turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive action to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures. Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first-party services and improved subscription performance. We will add more details to share with you on our next call. That said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first-party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first-party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of our portfolio. Our expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through. First-party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth. Likewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about an expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's, SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability and recovery requirements. This is a large long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environment on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Our modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate, simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you, we will be hosting our INSIGHT user conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there.Michael J. BerryThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%. Given our expectation for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums, as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year '24, cash flow should normalize with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal '24 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year. Now to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovations will drive growth in the second half of fiscal year '24. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million was down 25%. Remember that first half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million grew 2% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million, increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First-party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services. As George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71%, came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago and again, reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record loan NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future. NAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations, and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million, were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4 '23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kickoff meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.15, was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance.We are reiterating our guidance for the full year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low-to-mid single digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected, primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue. We continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25%, and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year. If FX rates stay at the end of July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first half fiscal year '23 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last year's supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&amp;A. Kris?Kris NewtonThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.Shek Ming HoSo last quarter, you guys talked about spending for large enterprises were cautious where, obviously, you guys are overexposed. That doesn't seem like that has changed that much. From your conversation with the customers, do you have a sense when demand could start picking up maybe based on utilization data or whatnot? First, just give us some historical context at what utilization rate level do you start seeing demand pickup? And do you think that will be quite any different this cycle? I mean, while you are at it, talk about the trends in small and medium businesses as well.George KurianOverall, thank you for the question. Overall, the spending environment this past quarter was unchanged from what we saw in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Our mid-sized enterprise business across the globe and public sector did better than large enterprise. Within large enterprise, as we noted, the same verticals remained cautious in spending, service provider, high tech and to a lesser extent, financial services. With regard to their spending criteria, they are spending on strategic projects but are running infrastructure, broadly speaking, harder than meaning at higher levels of utilization than they typically do and what we typically tell them is best practice. That is common in such macro environment, but it's not a long-term trend. I think we expect them as we progress through the fiscal year for them to start to expand investment because they cannot run systems that hard. As we noted in our prepared remarks and in prior calls, we do not expect the macro to change substantially to support our guidance for the year. Our guidance for the year reflects our confidence both in the changes that we made in go-to-market as well as in our product portfolio that we've recently introduced.OperatorThe next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.Mehdi HosseiniI have two quick follow-ups. George, I want to go back to the big picture and revisit the topic of repatriation. How do you see generative AI strengthening this argument that there will be repatriation enterprises have better ownership of the data that, that would actually help with a faster adoption? Is there any update? Is there any feedback from the -- your conversation from your enterprise customers that you can share? And a quick follow-up. Can you provide a mix of a QLC NAND that you're procuring? And how do you see that changing towards the end of the calendar year?George KurianWith regard to Gen AI projects, which we are already engaged in, in a number of customers, we see a mix of use cases. I would say there are 3 common patterns. One is unstructured data. The second is the need for consistent data management, both security and privacy are hot topics as well as the lineage of data so that they can keep track of which version of Gen AI model is the best and most accurate. And then the third is from a deployment architecture, we are seeing them engage in both on-prem discussions as well as public cloud discussions. In public cloud, the advantages are much faster feature velocity as well as prepackaged models available on the public cloud. With the on-prem environments, the major sensitivity is the data being kept in a restricted location. So we intend to benefit from both. I don't think that it is a meaningful driver of repatriation at this point in the discussion Mehdi. There we're seeing a mix of public cloud and on-prem environments.Michael J. BerryAnd Mehdi, it's Mike. On the QLC, we're not going to break out specific numbers, but we would say we are procuring more of that. We've started to see the pickup. We'll see how the rest of the year goes, but we do expect that to continue as a percentage as we go through fiscal '24.OperatorThe next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Joseph Lima CardosoThis is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question for me. You reported a strong gross margin performance in the quarter. And I was just curious if you could quantify how much of the improvement was it related to premium? The premium benefits, strategic purchases, et cetera, that you've highlighted and how we should think about that tailwind as we progress through this year, including and excluding the expected price competition that you have embedded into the guide? And then just real quickly, a clarification on that last part. Like are you guys actually seeing price competition currently from your competitors?Michael J. BerryJoe, it's Mike. So on your question, we've talked a lot about premiums. And as we talked about last time, we're super excited to not have to talk about them anymore. So largely in Q1, all of those premiums have, I would say, gone away not only from a P&amp;L perspective but cash. We talked about that number was anywhere typically between, call it, $30 million and $40 million a quarter. Sometimes it bumped up to $50 million, so call it an average of about $40 million.That -- a good bit of that, we did not have to accrue in Q4 and then the rest rolled to Q1. So you saw 55 last quarter, 55 this quarter and now premiums are fully out of the number. So as you look forward, it's one of the reasons why we feel confident in the 55% guide, hey, there's always been price competition. We see it in certain geographies or certain customers. We haven't seen any material change to that. In our guide, we do expect that we will be -- we will need to be, call it, marginally more aggressive in certain situations, but certainly nothing significantly different than we are today.OperatorThe next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.Michael TsvetanovThis is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask your ARR in the quarter -- your ARR growth in the quarter slowed quite a bit. And I know you guys have pushed out your $2 billion sort of target. But I just want to take a step back and then think about like, to your first $1 billion, what -- how would you describe the trajectory to getting there? And maybe timing, if you can kind of just help us think about where we go from here?George KurianYes. I think, first of all, our -- we have 2 models in which we serve customers, the consumption model, which is essentially a pay-as-you-go utility model and then a subscription model, which is where the customer pays for a certain amount of capacity or managed units or capability and then renews that on an annual basis or a term basis. The consumption part of our business has grown to about 3/4 of our total business, roughly speaking, of our cloud business subscription is a quarter. And if you look at the last quarter's performance, the cloud storage and consumption businesses continue to perform well. They grew year-on-year. Their dollar-based net retention rate was at the industry average industry norms. Subscription is where we saw a challenge, both a small part of cloud storage subscription as well as cloud apps, and we are conducting a review, and we'll get to you an update at the next quarterly call about our plans for that part of our business.Michael TsvetanovOkay. That's helpful. And if I can just add one more. I just want to understand your all-flash business was down about 7%, and I can appreciate the macro backdrop there. But I'm wondering if you can just help me understand the share kind of trends and maybe your best estimate where that's been this quarter? How it's changing and kind of what your expectations are moving through the year?George KurianI think, first of all, the year-on-year compare for our flash product business is impacted by last year benefiting from elevated levels of backlog that we shipped in the comparable quarter last year. If you remove that backlog, flash actually grew year-on-year this quarter, and we saw strong growth from our capacity flash products. We expect the overall flash portfolio to grow as a percentage of our business through the course of the year. The first quarter customers were still qualifying our capacity flash products, the C-Series. And so we weren't able to move all of our intended customer environments over to all-flash yet, but they are headed that way. And so we feel really good about both the go-to-market changes that are starting to reflect in pipeline expansion as well as in the flash product portfolio that we have. And you should see that reflected in growth in the second half of the year. With regard to share gains, our expectation based on what the others have guided is that we have picked up the second position in share in the market behind Dell.OperatorThe next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.W. ChiuThis is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You guys noted that the product gross margin is expected to hold for the remainder of the year. But I think the latest industry forecast and commentary from NAND manufacturers implies that the market experience as a sharp overcorrection next year. Can you help us understand how this impacts your expectations for the next fiscal year and whether you've secured any pricing agreements for flash media beyond this fiscal year?Michael J. BerryYes. Victor, it's Mike. So we haven't guided for fiscal '25, but let us walk you to that. As we talked about between prebuys and price locks, we have secured a large portion of our NAND purchases for fiscal '24, not all of that. You never want to hedge the whole bucket, but we feel really good about that. In addition, some of those agreements do flow into fiscal '25. It's not a majority at this point. So where we stand today is we feel really good about where we are in '24. We have some of that rolling into '25, and we're certainly looking forward about, hey, what should we do? We'll do a lot more work on that, call it, in the next 90 days and update you on the next call. As you know, it's a very changing market. We want to make sure it be prudent and think through that. But it is something that we are looking hard at.W. ChiuOkay. That's helpful. And just on the other side of the legacy part of the business, the last several quarters have seen pretty sharp declines in shipments of legacy spinning drives. And I know historically, there's not very much correlation between storage media trends and storage systems. But more recently, one of your competitors have asserted that there won't be any new spinning -- these drives manufactured in 5 years. Do you have any view on this just commentary? Do you agree with this perspective? And how do you see this impacting the -- I guess, over the long run?George KurianListen, I think we have the best spinning media and the best flash technologies in the market. I think that's reflected by the richness of our feature set, the flexibility of our operating system and increasingly, the data security functionality that natively integrated into our offerings. I think that the outlines of what our competitors have talked about is a long time. And so we give our customers choice, and we'll continue to invest in a broad range of technologies that meet the right price performance points. When you cannot support a type of technology like our competitors cannot, then you have to throw grenades and say that, that technology doesn't exist because you frankly can't support it.W. ChiuOkay. So you think that, that's an extreme view, that legacy -- that spinning drives will be gone in 5 years. That's extreme in your opinion?George Kurian5 years is a long time in technology, as we've all learned.OperatorThe next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup.Asiya MerchantIn the past, I think you guided for some linearity on first half versus second half. So I just wanted to clarify if that still holds for the remainder of this year? And just back on the Public Cloud side of things. I know it's guiding to a little bit lower relative to prior expectations due to the subscription weakness. How should we think about just the linearity? I mean are we expecting these run rates to kind of continue? Do you have any more insight into how we should think about the growth rates for the rest of the year? Are we still looking at something -- are we still expecting from a year-on-year basis as the comps get easier in the back half of fiscal '24 to have cloud revenues accelerate from this point?Michael J. BerryYes. Thank you for the question. So on the first question on linearity, based on the midpoint of guidance, we are still assuming about 48% revenue in the first half and 52% in the second, pretty close to rounding, which is very consistent with what we did last quarter. So no big change there, and that's very consistent with the linearity that we've shown historically. Also our Q2 guide is up about 7% quarter-on-quarter, which is well within our historical linearity as well. On the cloud revenue number, so we're not going to update the guidance. We had originally thought and forecasted somewhere around, call it, mid-teens growth in that cloud revenue business. Even if as you look at the historical numbers, that cloud revenue, and we're not forecasting it. It will. If it stays where it's at today, there would still be growth year-over-year because of the growth last year. So we have baked all of that into our full year number. So we feel good about where we are on that guide. We'll see how the rest of the year goes. But at this point, we've reflected that in our full year number.OperatorThe next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.Krish SankarI have two high-level questions on AI for George. Our understanding is that most of the benefits of storage as we put all-flash unified file and object solution, a, is that assessment accurate? Or are you seeing hybrid HDD solution being used in AI workloads today? And second, for unified file and objects, can you speak about your product portfolio there and your competitive position compared to other solutions like Flash Array from Pure Storage and Power Scale from Dell? And also if the unified file and object solutions are most expected to benefit from AI, is the market share there similar to your market share and other storage solutions like block and pipe?George KurianListen, I think that the first comment that I would make is AI primarily operates today on unstructured data, whether it's predictive AI using unstructured data to analyze images or audio files or generative AI that analyzes text in various types of document format, unstructured data is the priority. Second, I think with regard to unified file and object, listen, we created unified storage, and we have a really strong track record in unified across filed block, object and cloud. And I think that is the new definition of unified rather than little systems that try to say that they've got one protocol or the other. I think the third is when you talk about AI, it's a broad topic and therefore, what customers typically have is, versions of data that they use to train different models at the time that they are running the training workload, they typically store it on a high-performance landscape like an on all-flag system, but they keep those models available so that they can go back and look at when they make changes to models and data sets and what the implications are for accuracy. And so the archival life cycle of that data is usually on disk or on cloud. And then I think the last point I would make is, listen, we are seeing clients use hybrid workflows. Public cloud is a strong place where a lot of the developers and data science teams are beginning their workflows, either Vertex in and Google or SageMaker in Amazon and our solutions on public cloud give us a strong position to start with the data science team at the start of these AI projects.OperatorThe next question is from David Vogt with UBS.David VogtI had some phone difficulties. So I apologize if you addressed this. On sort of the AI sort of strategy going forward versus like mass capacity storage, what are you hearing from your customers from the enterprise side in terms of what the priority looks like from an investment perspective? I know your mass capacity product is seeing some really strong traction out of the gate. But over the longer term, how do you think the mix between high end, high-performance storage and mass capacity trends? And then maybe just on Public Cloud real quickly. I know this has been sort of a fits and starts business for you. When you think about how much of maybe an impact that is on your management bandwidth, how are you thinking about that business longer term now? I know you're talking about giving out updated outlook maybe next quarter. But do you still think it has the same opportunity to be a key driver for the business? Or is it maybe a little bit less of a longer-term opportunity today than you might have thought 90 days ago or even a year ago at this point?George KurianLet me hit on those two points. I think the first is with regard to AI, again, as I mentioned, it's a broad life cycle of tasks. There are light portions of the life cycle that run on extremely high-performance systems. And then there are portions of the life cycle where that data sits on more fine-tuned capacity-oriented systems because you want to keep versions of your models available. And so I look at it like any type of workload, there's a portion of time where the workload has data that's hot and then there's a portion of its life cycle where you want to keep a copy of that data. With regard to the overall all-flash array outlook, listen, I think we have 1 quarter in. We are really pleased with the adoption of our capacity flash products. Overall, what I see is all-flash will grow at higher -- than our total storage business and will be a bigger part of our mix. Within all-flash, the capacity flash products will grow more quickly than the performance flash products because one is attacking the next tranche of upgrades and refreshes, which is the 10K drive market while the high-performance products have already been in market for a long period of time. So I think that's how they break that out. With regard to cloud, I think that, listen, the opportunity is strong. We are excited about the growth of our cloud storage services. All of the capabilities and the pace of customer adoption of those services. We have more exciting news to come with Google around the work we're doing with them, both with regard to the expansion of our offerings as well as new use cases in the Google Cloud that you'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. And I think that our approach right now is to focus on the best parts of our cloud portfolio, have a dedicated go-to-market model that has been well received by the hyperscalers. We're 1 quarter in. The cloud storage and consumption offerings performed well. We have work to do on the subscription side. We'll give you an update next quarter. Our overall view of cloud has not changed.OperatorThe next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.Steven Bryant FoxI just wanted to follow up on some of those last comments, George, especially on subscription. I guess I'm wondering, obviously, you want to grow faster in public cloud. And the subscription business being down, it seems like it's consistent with the type of macro we're in. So I guess I'm trying to understand more specifically, given all the other stuff that's going on in terms of public cloud, in terms of refining the business, why the subscription business is especially disappointing here as opposed to maybe riding it out until you start to see an up cycle?George KurianYes. Listen, I think that we are not the only company in the world that had a subscription cloud software business that got impacted. When we saw the trends for optimization, you generally see the consumption part of the business get optimized quickly because you are on a pay-as-you-go contract. I think the subscription part usually gets affected at the time of a renewal of a subscription or a decision to expand or not expand a subscription. That doesn't excuse the fact that we wanted to do better in the subscription part of our business. I think we've got work to do to refine our portfolio, sharpen the value proposition, optimize pricing in certain cases to meet customers' expectations, and we'll give you an update on that. We're already working on those. We'll give you an update on that on the next call.OperatorThe next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Wamsi MohanIt sounds from your comments like you had at least 7 to 8 points of backlog-related headwind from last year in AFA. Can you help us think through -- is the magnitude sort of similar in fiscal 2Q? And for fiscal second half on the Hybrid Cloud side, is it fair to think that there's going to be a 4- to 5-point acceleration in growth? And as you look at the estimates that the Street's modeling is kind of -- that's kind of what is implied. And I'm wondering if you could talk about what is the upside that you're seeing in hybrid that's offsetting the weakness in public, given your relative overall guidance didn't change?Michael J. BerryWamsi, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So let's go through the numbers. So yes, you're pretty close on the impact. It was about -- so last quarter, we talked about, if you adjust for the backlog benefit in the first half of fiscal '23 and you compared our growth this first half with the second half of last year when we declined about 5% or 6%, we expect the growth to be better than that, still slightly negative. That is about the same in Q1 and Q2. So Q2 has about the same impact. Based on the midpoint of guidance, we do expect Hybrid Cloud then to have growth in the second half, the low single-digit growth based on the guidance that we gave. And we're still comfortable with that based on the progress that we saw in Q1, especially related to C-Series. The focus that we have on the new products as well as the go-to-market changes, we do expect those to bear more fruit as we go into the second half, and that's based on what we've seen not only in pipelines and then also sales activity. So overall, yes, that would be accurate, and that's what gives us confidence as we go into the second half of the year.OperatorThe next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.Meta A. MarshallMaybe as a first question, you noted that the storage and consumption piece of the business you expected that, that was growing about market rate this quarter. I guess just is kind of the assumption there that essentially optimization has stabilized, and we are starting to see growth again? I just kind of want to get a sense of where you guys are in terms of what you -- if we're at kind of the bottom of optimization and seeing growth again or if we're still kind of in this bottomed out period? And then as a second question, just if there's any kind of surprises in terms of customer types or workload types that have been more interested in C-Series than kind of initially expected?George KurianOn the first question, Meta, I think that what we saw was continued good pace of customer additions, which means that there are cloud projects and ongoing deployment of workloads on the cloud. We saw the pace of optimization slowdown as customers have basically done the easy stuff. And so now they probably are more cautious about what further to optimize. Within the latter bucket, the customers that have been optimizing, there are early signs of them starting to do new projects on our technology, but they haven't ramped those projects yet. So the benefit we saw within the quarter was new customers and new workloads as opposed to the ones that optimize reaccelerating spending. With regard to the second question, capacity flash, we were selling high-performance flash into use cases, where capacity flash was a better product. Those were in 2 flavors. One would be more of a general purpose private cloud environment where customers don't care about the performance of a particular application, but generally want good performance. And so that was one. And then smaller environments where we had the A150 product that was also introduced at a lower price point than any other flash product. Both of them saw strength. And I think we saw strength in the mid-market segment, broadly speaking, across all of our products.OperatorThe next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.Amit Jawaharlaz DaryananiI got cut off in the middle, so I apologize if this was addressed. But on the Public Cloud, can you just talk about what are the reasons that led to the miss of here? Was it macro or was there any micro impact as well? And then when you talk about the initiatives you're taking, is it more around just aligning your specialists to the hyperscalers? Or are you taking any more incremental initiatives? Just love to understand macro versus micro impact? And then what are the initiatives you're specifically taking to address them?George KurianI think broadly speaking, if you look at our cloud business, roughly 3/4 is consumption and 1/4 is subscription. That mix has shifted in favor of consumption a meaningful amount over the last year as customers have preferred more of the marketplace and first-party offerings over some of our more traditional subscription type, bring your own license offerings. I think the impact that we saw was more pronounced in subscription rather than consumption. Consumption performed quite well. And so I would point out that it's in the 1/4 of the business in subscription. Then second, with regard to whether it was macro or micro, it was a mix of things. I think it was -- in some customers, clearly, it was related to budget constraints, where upon renewal, they said, listen, I want to use less of the product and only use it for the most mission-critical environment, some of our monitoring tools. In other cases, it was the customer not being ready to deploy the product and so we've taken a couple of actions. One action is to, as we said, conduct a review of our products, make sure we have the right products tailored to the right use cases that pricing is set up right, that the value share between us and the customers set up right, that is already underway. We've implemented some of those changes. We'll give you a more fulsome update. And then with regard to go-to-market, we've, as we noted, implemented both a dedicated cloud specialist organization aligned with the hyperscalers and also implemented customer success so that customers can get expertise from NetApp on how to use the products. It's early. We've seen some good evidence of progress, but there's more work to be done.Amit Jawaharlaz DaryananiGot it. That's really helpful. And Mike, if I could just have you clarify Q1 free cash flow, I think, was much better than what I had expected and what you typically be in Q1, I think, as well. Can you just touch on maybe what drove that, if there was a bit of a pull-in or something with some of the stuff? And any view on fiscal year free cash flow, given the strong performance here?Michael J. BerryYes. Awesome. Thanks for the question on cash. Yes, there was -- it was quite a bit better than we thought. There was three moving parts. I mean I would say you've seen billings commence lower in the last 2 quarters. So collections were down year-over-year. But what really drove the operating and free cash flow was the reduction in our supply chain spending. And that's not only premiums. It's the quantity of components that came down significantly. And then, of course, pricing came down as well. So that, if you think about the rest of the year, we should expect to continue to see some of that benefit not as big as in Q1 because that compares to Q1 of last year when we were still, I'll call it, bulking up on inventory because we expect the growth before things slowed down in the middle of the year. There was a onetime benefit year-over-year, which unfortunately is we paid a good bit less in incentive compensation. So that helped drive it as well. And then lower CapEx helped drive free cash flow as well. And we did say, hey, the $239 million we spent last year, we expect to be the high and we expect that to continue to come down. As you look at the rest of the year, we do expect on a full year basis, it to track pretty close to non-GAAP net income, which guidance is somewhere around $1.2 billion. I do want to note, though, hey, folks in Q2 -- and this happens every year, keep in mind, it's the quarter we pay most of our taxes. So we pay almost $88 million in repatriation taxes and then we make our U.S. federal tax payment as well. So expect Q2 to be down from Q1, and it's been like that every year. And then in the back half, following more typical trends. So thanks for the question.OperatorAnd the final question today comes from Shannon Cross with Crédit Suisse.Shannon Siemsen CrossI guess my first question, George, can you talk about ONTAP AI from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing this as an ability basically to sell into your existing customer base who are using ONTAP and comfortable with it in that? Or is this something that, from a competitive differentiation standpoint, can actually drive switchers to NetApp's product set? And then I have a follow-up.George KurianWe sell ONTAP AI into data science teams and AI teams, whether they are in our installed base or net new accounts. They are -- it's a very verticalized selling model. So for example, in pharmaceuticals, we work with teams on rapid drug discovery, clinical data analysis so that they can apply really high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA with -- together with large-scale data storage from NetApp. We could also do the same thing. For example, in manufacturing, we are selling into advanced digital twin prototypes where they are optimizing manufacturing yield and sort of accelerating development. So I think those are the key areas that we have sort of net new budget, net new customer landscape. Our advantages are high performance, large scale advanced data management, the best in the industry, and it's highly integrated into the data science toolkit of our customers. And then increasingly, we also now have the same versions of 2 chains running on all the leading public clouds, and you'll hear more about that in the next couple of weeks at the Google conference.Shannon Siemsen CrossOkay. And then I guess we've to ask you about AI from sort of an opportunity standpoint. But how are you thinking about utilizing generative AI internally within NetApp to increase productivity, save costs and maybe, I don't know, improve customer experience?George KurianWe already use AI tools in 3 ways. One is to accelerate software development and to increase the pace at which we can deliver more innovation to customers. The second, to integrate AI into our products and services so that we can automatically detect, for example, ransomware attacks or impending risks from running systems harder than they should be or various other things and give customers proactive advice rather than reactive response. And then the third is across the range of our businesses, everything from marketing collateral, documentation, multilingual support as well as chatbots. In customer service, we have AI capabilities already being integrated. And Gen AI is the next version of that. So there are lots of exciting projects underway on that. Thank you, Shannon. Let me close with a few comments. The strong customer reception to the substantial innovation we have brought to market has got in FY '24 to a solid start, despite the choppy macro backdrop. We are laser-focused on our FY '24 priorities to be prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, to reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in our storage systems business and to build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Early results of this focus indicate we are on track to drive the margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. I am absolutely delighted by the positive reception to our new products, the differentiation and continued growth of our first-party public cloud storage services and our exciting innovation road map. I hope to see you at INSIGHT and look forward to updating on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you.OperatorThe conference has now concluded.

I'll now turn the call over to George.George Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on: managing the elements within our control; reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business; and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability, and further strengthen our position for long-term success.Story continuesLooking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family. Similarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level, high performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience. Building on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-series, a family of SAN-specific all-flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees.These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms. Complementing our unified storage offerings, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud. In May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objectives appropriately aligned to each team's strengths.Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities. The changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion, and should help drive top line growth in the second-half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on product and AFA revenue. Additionally, as Mike will outline, the first-half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons.In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA-proven architecture, in 2018. Today, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp's storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective predictive and generative AI projects depend on high quality, well-managed, unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on premises.High performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves. While early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises, as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp Cloud Volumes services. Accelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on-premises and in the cloud.With built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions. Our confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list. Now, turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive actions to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures.Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first party services and improve subscription performance. We will have more details to share with you on our next call. That said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public Cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of the portfolio. Our expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through.First party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth. Likewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about the expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability, and recovery requirements.This is a large, long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environments on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted, and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects.Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business, and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top-line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you we'll be hosting our INSIGHT user conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there.Mike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second-half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%.Given our expectations for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums, as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year ‘24, cash flow should normalize, with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal ‘24 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year.Now, to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovations will drive growth in the second-half of fiscal year ‘24. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million was down 25%. Remember that first-half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million grew 2% year-over-year.Public Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission-critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services. As George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71% came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago, and again reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record low NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future.NAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4'23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation, as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kick-off meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations.EPS of $1.15 was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago.We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full-year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue. We continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25%, and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year.If FX rates stay at end-of-July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first-half fiscal year ‘23 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last year’s supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders.I’ll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q &amp; A. Kris?Kris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let’s begin the Q&amp;A.See also 25 Most Innovative Companies Of All Time and 15 Highest Paying Countries for Veterinarians.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Sidney Ho: Great. Thanks for doing the call. So last quarter, you guys talked about spending for large enterprises were cautious, where obviously you guys are overexposed. That doesn't seem like that has changed that much. From your conversation with customers, do you have a sense when demand could start picking up, maybe based on utilization data or whatnot? First, just give us some historical context at what utilization rate level do you start seeing demand pick up, and do you think that will be quite any different this cycle? I mean, while you’re at it talk about the trends in small and medium businesses as well? Thanks.George Kurian: Overall -- thank you for the question. Overall, the spending environment this past quarter was unchanged from what we saw in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Our mid-sized enterprise business across the globe and public sector did better than large enterprise. Within large enterprise, as we noted, the same verticals remained cautious in spending, service provider, high-tech and, to a lesser extent, financial services. With regard to their spending criterion, they are spending on strategic projects but are running infrastructure, broadly speaking, hotter than meaning at higher levels of utilization than they typically do and what we typically tell them is best practice. That is common in such macro environments, but it's not a long-term trend.I think we expect them as we progress through the fiscal year for them to start to expand investment because they cannot run systems that hard. As we noted in our prepared remarks and in prior calls, we do not expect the macro to change substantially to support our guidance for the year. Our guidance for the year reflects our confidence both in the changes that we made in go-to-market as well as in our product portfolio that we recently introduced.Sidney Ho: Okay, thank you.Operator: The next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick follow-ups. George, I want to go back to the big picture and revisit the topic of repatriation. How do you see generative AI strengthening this argument that there will be repatriation enterprises have better ownership of the data that, that would actually help with a faster adoption? Is there any update? Is there any feedback from the -- your conversation from your enterprise customers that you can share? And a quick follow-up. Can you provide a mix of a QLC NAND that you're procuring? And how do you see that changing towards the end of the calendar year?George Kurian: With regard to Gen AI projects, which we are already engaged in, in a number of customers, we see a mix of use cases. I would say there are three common patterns. One is unstructured data. The second is the need for consistent data management, both security and privacy are hot topics as well as the lineage of data so that they can keep track of which version of Gen AI model is the best and most accurate. And then the third is from a deployment architecture, we are seeing them engage in both on-prem discussions, as well as public cloud discussions. In public cloud, the advantages are much faster feature velocity, as well as prepackaged models available on the public cloud. With the on-prem environments, the major sensitivity is the data being kept in a restricted location.So we intend to benefit from both. I don't think that it is a meaningful driver of repatriation at this point in the discussion maybe. There we're seeing a mix of public cloud and on-prem environments.Mike Berry: And then, hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. On the QLC, we're not going to break-out specific numbers, but we would say we are procuring more of that. We started to see the pickup. We'll see how the rest of the year goes, but we do expect that to continue as a percentage as we go through fiscal '24.Mehdi Hosseini: Great. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.Joe Cardoso: Hey, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question from me. You reported a strong gross margin performance in the quarter and I was just curious if you could quantify how much of the improvement were is it related to premium? The premium benefits, strategic purchases, et-cetera, that you've highlighted and how we should think about that tailwind as we progress through this year, including and excluding the expected price competition that you have embedded into the guide? And then just real quickly, a clarification on that last part, like are you guys actually seeing price competition currently from your competitors? Thanks.Mike Berry: Hey Joe, it's Mike. So, on your question, we've talked a lot about premiums and as we talked about last-time, we're super-excited and not have to talk about them anymore. So largely in Q1, all of those premiums have I would say gone away, not only from a P&amp;L perspective, but cash. We talked about that number was anywhere typically between, call it, $30 million and $40 million a quarter, sometimes it bumped up to $50 million, so call it an average of about $40 million. That -- we got a good bit of that. We did not have to accrue in Q4 and then the rest hold to Q1. So it's 55% last quarter, 55% this quarter. And now premiums are fully out-of-the number. So as you look-forward, it's one of the reasons why we feel confident in the 55% guide.There -- hey, there has always been price competition. We see it in certain geographies or certain customers. We haven't seen any material change to that in our guide. We do expect that we will be -- we will need to be, call it, marginally more aggressive in certain situations, but certainly nothing significantly different than we are today.Joseph Cardoso: Thanks for the color.Mike Berry: Yes.Operator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.Michael Tsvetanov: Yes, thank you, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask, your ARR in the quarter -- your ARR growth in the quarter slowed quite a bit. And I know you guys have pushed out your $2 billion sort of target, but I just wanted to take a step-back and I think about like to your first billion, what -- how would you describe the trajectory to getting there and maybe timing? If you can kind of just help us think about where we go from here? Thank you.George Kurian: Yes, I think first of all, our -- we have two models in which we serve customers; the consumption model, which is essentially a pay-as-you-go utility model; and then a subscription model, which is where the customer pays for a certain amount of capacity or managed units or capability and then renews that on an annual basis or a term basis. Then consumption part of our business has grown to about three quarters of our total business, roughly speaking. Of our cloud business, subscription is the quarter. And if you look at the last quarter's performance, the cloud storage and consumption businesses continue to perform well. They grew year-on-year. Their dollar-based net retention rate was at the industry average, industry norms.Subscription is where we saw a challenge, both a small part of cloud storage subscription as well as CloudOps and we are conducting a review and we'll get you an update at the next quarterly call about our plans for that part of our business.Michael Tsvetanov: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And if I can just add one more. I just want to understand your all-flash business is down about 7%. And I can appreciate the macro backdrop there, but I'm wondering if you can just help me understand the share kind of trends? And maybe your best estimate where that's been this quarter? How it's changing? And kind of what your expectations are moving through the year? Thank you.George Kurian: I think first of all, the year-on-year compare for our flash product business is impacted by last year benefiting from elevated levels of backlog that we shipped in the comparable quarter last year. If you -- if you remove that backlog, flash actually grew year-on-year this quarter and we saw strong growth from our capacity flash products. We expect overall flash portfolio to grow as a percentage of our business through the course of the year. The first-quarter customers are still qualifying our capacity flash products, the C-Series. And so we weren't able to move all of our intended customer environments over to all-flash yet, but they are headed that way. And so we feel really good about both the go-to-market changes that are starting to reflect in pipeline expansion as well as in the flash product portfolio that we have.And you should see that reflected in growth in the second-half of the year. With regard to share gains, our expectation based on what the others have guided is that we have picked-up the second position in share in the market behind Dell.Operator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.Victor Chiu: Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You guys noted that the product gross margin is expected to hold for the remainder of the year, but I think the latest industry forecasts and commentary from NAND manufacturers implies that the market experiences a sharp overcorrection next year. Can you help us understand how this impacts your expectations for the next fiscal year and whether you've secured any pricing agreements for flash media beyond this fiscal year?Mike Berry: Yes. Hey, Victor, it's Mike. So, hey, we haven't guided for fiscal '25, but let us walk you through that. As we talked about between pre-buys and price locks, we have secured a large portion of our NAND purchases for fiscal '24, not all of it, you never want to hedge the whole bucket, but we feel really good about that. In addition, some of those agreements do flow into fiscal '25, it's not a majority at this point. So where we stand today as we feel really good about where we are at ‘24, we have some of that rolling into '25 and we are certainly looking for about -- what should we do? We'll do a lot more work on that, call it, in the next 90-days and update you on the next call. As you know, it's a very changing market. We want to make sure it be prudent and think through that, but it is something that we are looking hard at.Victor Chiu: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the other side of the legacy part of the business, the last several quarters have seen pretty sharp declines in shipments of legacy spinning drives. I know historically, there has not very much correlation between storage media trends, the storage systems, but more recently, one of your competitors have asserted that there won't be any new spinning disk drives manufacturer in five years. Do you have any view on this commentary? Do you agree with this perspective and how do you see this impacting NetApp I guess over the long-run?George Kurian: Listen, I think we have the best spinning media and the best flash technologies in the market. I think that's reflected by the richness of our feature set, the flexibility of our operating system and increasingly the data security functionality that natively integrated into our offerings. I think that the outlines of what our competitors have talked about is a long-time. And so we give our customers choice and we'll continue to invest in a broad range of technologies that meet the right price performance points. When you cannot support a type of technology, like our competitors cannot, then you have to throw grenades and say that that technology doesn't exist because you frankly can't support it.Victor Chiu: Okay, so you think that that's extreme view that that the past legacy -- is that spinning drives will be gone in five years, that's extreme in your opinion?George Kurian: Five years is a long-time in technology as we've all learned.Victor Chiu: Yes. Okay, okay. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.Asiya Merchant: Great, thank you for taking my question. In the past, I think you guided for some linearity on first-half versus second-half. So just wanted to clarify if that still holds for the remainder of this year? And just back on the public-cloud side of things. I know it's guiding to a little bit lower relative to prior expectations, due to the subscription weakness. How should we think about just the linearity? I mean, are we expecting these run-rates to kind of continue to have any more insight into how we should think about the growth rates for the rest of the year? Are we still looking at something -- are we still expecting from a year-on-year basis as the comps get easier in the back-half of fiscal '24 to have cloud revenues accelerate from this point? Thank you.George Kurian: Yes, thank you for the question. So, on the first question on linearity, based on the midpoint of guidance, we are still assuming about 48% revenue in the first-half and 52% in the second, pretty close to round in which is very consistent with what we did last quarter. So, no big change there. And that's very consistent with the linearity that we've shown historically. Also, our Q2 guide is up about 7% quarter-on-quarter, which is well within our historical linearity as well. On the cloud revenue number, so we're not going to update the guidance. We had originally thought and forecasted somewhere around, call it, mid-teens growth in that cloud revenue business. Even if as you look at the historical numbers, that cloud revenue, and we're not forecasting it, well, if it stays where it's at today, there would still be growth year-over-year because of the growth last year.So we have baked all of that into our full-year number, so we feel good about where we are on that guide. We'll see how the rest of the year goes. But at this point, we've reflected that in our full-year number.Asiya Merchant: Great, thank you.George Kurian: Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.Krish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two high-level questions in AI for George. Our understanding is that most of the benefit of storage, as we put all-flash unified file and object solution; A, is that assessment accurate or are you seeing hybrid HDD solutions being used in AI workloads today? And second, for unified cloud and object, can you speak about your product portfolio there and your competitive position, compared to other solutions like FlashBlade from Pure Storage and PowerScale from Dell. And also if unified filing object solutions are more expected of benefit from AI, it's a market share that's similar to market-share in other storage solutions like block and file? Thank you.George Kurian: Listen, I think that the first comment that I would make is AI primarily offerings today on unstructured data, whether it's predictive AI using unstructured data to analyze images or audio files or generative AI that analysis text on various types of document formats, unstructured data is the priority. Second, I think with regard to unified file and object, listen, we created unified storage and we have a really strong track-record in unified across file, block, object and cloud. And I think that is the new definition of unified rather than little systems that tried to say that they've got one protocol or the other. I think the third is when you talk about AI, it's a broad topic. And therefore, what customers typically have is versions of data that they used to trade different models.At the time that they are running the trading workload, they typically store it on a high-performance landscape like all-flash system. But they keep those models available so that they can go back and look at when they make changes to models and data sets and what the implications are for accuracy. And so the archival life cycle of that data is usually on disk or on cloud. And then I think the last point I would make is, listen, we are seeing clients use hybrid workflows. Public cloud is a strong place where a lot of the developers and data science teams are beginning their Workflows, either Vertex in and Google or Sagemaker in Amazon and our solutions on public cloud give us a strong position to start with the data science team at the start of these AI projects.Krish Sankar: Thank you, guys.Operator: The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.David Vogt: Great, thanks. Hey, George. Hey Mike. I had some phone difficulties. So I apologize if you addressed this. On sort of the AI sort of strategy going forward versus like mass capacity storage, what are you hearing from your customers from the enterprise side in terms of what the priority looks like from an investment perspective? I know your mass capacity product is seeing some really strong traction out of the gate. But over the longer term, how do you think the mix between high-end, high-performance storage and mass capacity trends? And then maybe just on Public Cloud real quickly, I know this has been sort of a fits and starts business for you. When you think about how much of maybe an impact on your management bandwidth, how are you thinking about that business longer term now?I know you're talking about giving out updated outlook maybe next quarter. But do you still think it has the same opportunity to be a key driver for the business? Or is it maybe a little bit less of a longer-term opportunity today than you might have thought 90 days ago or even a year ago at this point? Thanks.George Kurian: Let me hit on those two points. I think the first is with regard to AI, again, as I mentioned, it's a broad life cycle of tasks. There are light portions of the life cycle that run on extremely high-performance systems. And then there are portions of the life cycle where the data sits on more fine-tuned capacity-oriented systems because you want to keep versions of your models available. And so I look at it like any type of workload, there's a portion of time where the workload has data that's hot and then there's a portion of its life cycle where you want to keep a copy of the data. With regard to the overall all-flash array outlook, listen, I think we have one quarter in. We are really pleased with the adoption of our capacity flash products.Overall, what I see is all-flash will grow at higher than our total storage business and will be a bigger part of our mix. Within all-flash, the capacity flash products will grow more quickly than the performance flash products because one is attacking the next tranche of upgrades and refreshes, which is the 10-K drive market while the high-performance products have already been in market for a long period of time. So I think that's how they break that out. With regard to cloud, I think that, listen, the opportunity is strong. We are excited about the growth of our cloud storage services all of the capabilities and the pace of customer adoption of those services. We have more exciting news to come with Google around the work we're doing with them, both with regard to the expansion of our offerings as well as new use cases in the Google Cloud that you'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks.And I think that our approach right now is to focus on the best parts of our cloud portfolio have a dedicated go-to-market model that has been well received by the hyperscalers. We're 1 quarter in. The cloud storage and consumption offerings performed well. We have work to do on the subscription side. We'll give you an update next quarter. Our overall view of cloud has not changed.David Vogt: Great, thanks guys.Operator: The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.Steven Fox: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on some of those last comments, George, especially on subscription. I guess I'm wondering, obviously, you want to grow faster in public cloud. But -- and the subscription business being down, it seems like it's consistent with the type of macro we're in. So I guess I'm trying to understand more specifically, given all the other stuff that's going on in terms of public cloud, in terms of refining the business, why the subscription business is especially disappointing here as opposed to maybe riding it out until you start to see an up cycle? Thanks.George Kurian: Yes. Listen, I think that we are not the only company in the world that had a subscription cloud software business that got impacted. When we saw the trends for optimization, you generally see the consumption part of the business get optimized quickly because you are on a pay-as-you-go contract. I think the subscription part usually gets affected at the time of a renewal of a subscription or a decision to expand or not expand a subscription. That doesn't excuse the fact that we wanted to do better in the subscription part of our business. I think we've got work to do to refine our portfolio, sharpen the value proposition, optimize pricing in certain cases to meet customers' expectations, and we'll give you an update on that. We're already working on those. We'll give you an update on that on the next call.Steven Fox: Great, that’s helpful. Thank you.Operator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. It sounds from your comments like you had at least 7 to 8 points of backlog-related headwind from last year in AFA. Can you help us think through is the magnitude sort of similar in fiscal 2Q? And for fiscal second-half on the Hybrid Cloud side, is it fair to think that there's going to be a 4 to 5 point acceleration in growth? And as you look at the estimates that the Street's modeling is kind of -- that's kind of what is implied. And I'm wondering if you could talk about what is the upside that you're seeing in hybrid that's offsetting the weakness in public, given your relative overall guidance didn't change? Thank you so much.Mike Berry: Hey, Wamsi, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So let's go through the numbers. So yes, you're pretty close on the impact. It was about [Technical Difficulty] So last quarter, we talked about, if you adjust for the backlog benefit in the first half of fiscal '23 and you compared our growth this first-half with the second-half of last year when we declined about 5% or 6%, we expect the growth to be better than that, still slightly negative. That is about the same in Q1 and Q2, so Q2 has about the same impact. Based on the midpoint of guidance, we do expect Hybrid Cloud then to have growth in the second-half, the low-single-digit growth based on the guidance that we gave. And we're still comfortable with that based on the progress that we saw in Q1, especially related to C-Series.The focus that we have on the new products, as well as the go-to-market changes, we do expect those to bear more fruit as we go into the second-half, and that's based on what we've seen not only in pipelines and then also sales activity. So overall, yes, that would be accurate, and that's what gives us confidence as we go into the second-half of the year.Wamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you so much.Operator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Meta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe as a first question, you noted that the storage and consumption piece of the business you expected that, that was growing about market rate this quarter. I guess just is kind of the assumption there that essentially optimization has stabilized, and we are starting to see growth again? I just kind of want to get a sense of where you guys are in terms of what you -- if we're at kind of the bottom of optimization and seeing growth again or if we're still kind of in this bottom out period? And then as a second question, just if there's any kind of surprises in terms of customer types or workload types that have been more interested in C-Series than kind of initially expected? Thanks.George Kurian: On the first question, Meta, I think that what we saw was continued good pace of customer additions, which means that there are cloud projects and ongoing deployment of workloads on the cloud. We saw the pace of optimization slowdown as customers have basically done the easy stuff. And so now they probably are more cautious about what further to optimize. Within the latter bucket, the customers that have been optimizing, there are early signs of them starting to do new projects on our technology, but they haven't ramped those projects yet. So the benefit we saw within the quarter was new customers and new workloads as opposed to the ones that optimize reaccelerating spending. With regard to the second question, capacity flash, we were selling high-performance flash into use cases where capacity flash was a better product.Those were in two flavors. One would be more of a general purpose private cloud environment where customers don't care about the performance of a particular application, but generally want good performance. And so that was one and then smaller environments where we had the A150 product that was also introduced at a lower price point than any other flash product. Both of them saw strength. And I think we saw strength in the mid-market segment, broadly speaking, across all of our products.Meta Marshall: Great, thank you.Operator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.Amit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I got caught off in the middle, so I apologize if this was addressed. But on the Public Cloud, can you just talk about what are the reasons that led to the miss of here? Was it macro or there any micro impact as well? And then when you talk about the initiatives you're taking, is it more around just aligning your specialists to the hyperscalers? Or are you taking any more incremental initiatives? Just love to understand macro versus micro impact? And then what are the initiatives you're specifically taking to address them?George Kurian: I think broadly speaking, if you look at our cloud business, roughly three-quarter is consumption and one-quarter is subscription. That mix has shifted in favor of consumption a meaningful amount over the last year as customers have preferred more of the marketplace and first-party offerings over some of our more traditional subscription type, bring your own license offerings. I think the impact that we saw was more pronounced in subscription rather than consumption. Consumption performed quite well. And so I would point out that it's in the one-quarter of the business in subscription. Then second, with regard to whether it was macro or micro, it was a mix of things. I think it was -- in some customers, clearly, it was related to budget constraints, where upon renewal, they said, listen, I want to use less of the product and only use it for the most mission-critical environment, some of our monitoring tools.In other cases, it was the customer not being ready to deploy the product and so we've taken a couple of actions. One action is to, as we said, conduct a review of our products, make sure we have the right products tailored to the right use cases that pricing is set up right, that the value share between us and the customers set up right, that is already underway. We've implemented some of those changes. We'll give you a more fulsome update. And then with regard to go-to-market, we've, as we noted, implemented both a dedicated cloud specialist organization aligned with the hyperscalers and also implemented customer success so that customers can get expertise from NetApp on how to use the products. It's early. We've seen some good evidence of progress, but there's more work to be done.Amit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And Mike, if I could just have you clarify Q1 free cash flow, I think, was much better than what I had expected and what you typically be in Q1, I think, as well. Can you just touch on maybe what drove that, if there was a bit of a pull-in or something with some of the stuff? And any view on fiscal year free cash flow, given the strong performance here?Mike Berry: Yes. Awesome. Thanks for the question on cash. Yes, there was -- it was quite a bit better than we thought. There was three moving parts. Amit, I would say you've seen billings come in lower in the last two quarters. So collections were down year-over-year. But what really drove the operating and free cash flow was the reduction in our supply chain spending. And that's not only premiums. It's the quantity of components that came down significantly. And then, of course, pricing came down as well. So that, if you think about the rest of the year, we should expect to continue to see some of that benefit not as big as in Q1 because that compares to Q1 of last year when we were still, I'll call it, bulking up on inventory because we expect the growth before things slowed down in the middle of the year.You know, the one-time benefit year-over-year, which unfortunately is we paid a good bit less in incentive compensation. So that helped drive it as well. And then lower CapEx helped drive free cash flow as well. And we did say, hey, the $239 million we spent last year, we expect to be the high and we expect that to continue to come down. As you look at the rest of the year, we do expect on a full-year basis it to track pretty close to non-GAAP net income, which guidance is somewhere around $1.2 billion. I do want to note, though, hey, folks in Q2 -- and this happens every year, keep in mind, it's the quarter we pay most of our taxes. So we pay almost $88 million in repatriation taxes and then we make our U.S. federal tax payment as well. So expect Q2 to be down from Q1, and it's been like that every year.And then in the back half, following more typical trends. So thanks for the question.Amit Daryanani: Thank you.Operator: And the final question today comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I guess my first question, George, can you talk about ONTAP AI from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing this as an ability basically to sell into your existing customer base you are using ONTAP and comfortable with it in that? Or is this something that, from a competitive differentiation standpoint, can actually drive switchers to NetApp's product set? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.George Kurian: We sell ONTAP AI into data science teams and AI teams, whether they are in our installed base or net new accounts. They are -- it's a very verticalized selling model. So for example, in pharmaceuticals, we work with teams on rapid drug discovery, clinical data analysis so that they can apply really high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA with -- together with large-scale data storage from NetApp. We could also do the same thing. For example, in manufacturing, we are selling into advanced digital twin prototypes where they are optimizing manufacturing yield and sort of accelerating development. So I think those are the key areas that we have sort of net new budget, net new customer landscape. Our advantages are high performance, large scale advanced demo management, the best in the industry, and it's highly integrated into the data science toolkit of our customers.And then increasingly, we also now have the same versions of 2 chains running on all the leading public clouds, and you'll hear more about that in the next couple of weeks at the Google conference.Shannon Cross: Okay. And then I guess we've asked you about AI from sort of an opportunity standpoint. But how are you thinking about utilizing generative AI internally within NetApp to increase productivity, save costs and maybe, I don't know, improve customer experience? Thanks.George Kurian: We already use AI tools in three ways. One is to accelerate software development and to increase the pace at which we can deliver more innovation to customers. The second, to integrate AI into our products and services so that we can automatically detect, for example, ransomware attacks or impending risks from running systems harder than they should be or various other things and give customers proactive advice rather than reactive response. And then the third is across the range of our businesses, everything from marketing collateral, documentation, multilingual support as well as chatbots. In customer service, we have AI capabilities already being integrated. And Gen AI is the next version of that. So there are lots of exciting projects underway on that. Thank you, Shannon.Shannon Cross: Thank you.George Kurian: Let me close with a few comments. The strong customer reception to the substantial innovation we have brought to market has got in FY '24 to a solid start, despite the choppy macro backdrop. We are laser-focused on our FY '24 priorities to be prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, to reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in our storage systems business and to build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Early results of this focus indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. I am absolutely delighted by the positive reception to our new products, the differentiation and continued growth of our first-party public cloud storage services and our exciting innovation road map. I hope to see you at INSIGHT and look forward to updating on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you.Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

Businesses in decline often have two underlying trends, firstly, a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining base of capital employed. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. Having said that, after a brief look, PPL (NYSE:PPL) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for PPL, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.042 = US$1.5b ÷ (US$38b - US$2.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, PPL has an ROCE of 4.2%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 4.5%, it's still a low return by itself. Check out our latest analysis for PPL roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PPL compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PPL here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThere is reason to be cautious about PPL, given the returns are trending downwards. About five years ago, returns on capital were 8.4%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on PPL becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. Investors must expect better things on the horizon though because the stock has risen 8.6% in the last five years. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere.One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing PPL that you might find interesting.While PPL may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis and head directly to the most disliked foods in the US, go directly to the 7 Most Hated Foods in the US according to Reddit.In a previous article, we explored some of the worst performing food chains in the United States. This article will have a more subjective look at the most hated food in the United States. While all of us can unanimously agree that food is an integral part of our lives, the nutrients it contains act as fuel for our bodies, providing us with the energy to function throughout the day. But it has always been beyond simple nourishment; it is no less than an experience that brings warmth and joy to our lives. Whether it's the aroma of freshly baked bread or the sizzle of a perfectly seared steak, food has the power to kindle emotions and garner long-lasting memories. A good home-cooked meal shared with those we love is nothing less than a privilege. This is so because the warmth is not only because of the taste and texture but because of the love and hard work that goes behind making each dish.Not only this, foods around the world are also a fundamental component of cultures across the world. Each country’s culture has its distinct taste and style of presenting food; it becomes a part of its identity. For instance, when one thinks of Turkey, Turkish tea is bound to come across one’s mind. It is a symbol of their hospitality and is one of the main components of socialization there. Similarly, the USA’s culture is popularly associated with junk, fast, and processed foods because of the fast-paced lives individuals tend to live there. Since people are emotionally concerned about food, they are likely to form extreme hatred towards disliked food.  Is social media impacting people’s food choices?Digital food culture has also emerged in this digital age era, with food images making their way onto our social media. Similarly, culinary topics have become one of the top trending topics on it. If a user were to type in #food right now on their Instagram, around 510M posts would show up with this hashtag only, not including other trending hashtags such as #foodie, #foodporn, etc. Food communities exist across various social media platforms like Reddit where people from all facets of life exchange and share their experiences, preferences, and bond over similar food interests. We have also seen the emergence of food blogging in the past few years where food bloggers post aesthetic pictures of their food and leave reviews about their culinary experiences. These reviews in turn play a vital role in influencing people’s decision about what foods to try and what not to try. Social media, therefore, has started to play a significant part in defining people’s taste palettes. In this article, we will look at people’s opinions on one such social media platform to determine the 20 Most Hated Foods in the US.Story continuesHow is the US food industry doing amid inflation? Over the past year, the cost of meals and snacks from limited-service restaurants increased by 7.9% as shown in the inflation data. McDonald’s Corp (NYSE: MCD) is one of the largest food chains in the United States. The weakening of major currencies against US dollars and inflation meant that McDonald’s Corp (NYSE: MCD) had to increase the prices. Customers responded to this by cutting back on items such as McDonald’s Corp (NYSE: MCD) fries with their burgers. Some fast food restaurant customers are also not happy with the recent developments/expectations about tipping (see 20 Countries that Tip the Most).It seems, however, that consumers are more receptive to price hikes in Snacks as opposed to a complete meal. Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ) is the owner of many well-known snack brands around the world, including Cadbury and Oreo. Despite implementing a price hike, its net revenue in the second quarter of the current year climbed by 15.8%. Dirk Van de Put, CEO of Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ), sights investment in creative assets as one of the reasons for revenue growth despite price hikes. In addition, some of the innovations by Mondelez International Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLZ), such as low-calorie chocolate bars are also cited as reasons for sustained revenue growth. A few of the most hated foods in the US according to Reddit users are cheese, salad dressing, and condiments that are produced by companies like The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC). These products made our list not because everyone hates them, but because there are enough people who hate them and complain about these foods on platforms like Reddit. Actually, the demand for The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC)'s products is quite consistent and stable. KHC generated $25 billion in sales in 2019, $26 billion in each of 2020 and 2021, and $26.5 billion in 2022. Its sales is expected to exceed $27 billion in 2023. Given the high inflation rates, the company's topline has been growing less than preferred by its investors. As a result, KHC share price has been hovering around $33 for the last 4 years. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett owns around a quarter of the company. We believe the stock is a promising long-term investment as its trailing P/E is only 13 and the company has been trying to reduce its $19 billion in long-term debt to cut down its $800 million in annual interest payments.Methodology20 Most Hated Foods in the US According to Redditart-sonik/Shutterstock.comTo generate our list of the 20 Most Hated Foods in the US according to Reddit, we collected the data in the form of opinions of people in the US on the social media platform, Reddit. People had discussed both the foods that they liked and disliked, however, for this article, we only considered the opinions about the foods that were unpopular among the people in the US. For our list, we used the number of comments and upvotes on several food threads that involved people’s opinions on foods that they hated in the US. The ranking is done based upon the most repeated comments, and the opinions with the highest number of upvotes. Hence, they are our determinants of which foods are unpopular in the US.20 Most Hated Foods in the US according to Reddit20 -  PicklesPickles may be a huge part of burgers in the US, however, it is one of the most hated foods when eaten raw. Redditors say that pickles ruin their salads and sandwiches for them because of their weird smell and texture. A Reddit user wrote: “Pickles are the most vile, disgusting, and repulsive food anyone has ever come up with.” However, there are some pickles that Americans might like to eat such as the cucumber ones but have a strong distaste for okra and Indian pickles.  19 -  Brussels SproutsBrussels sprouts are not liked by most people living in America, similar to how most people do not like to eat broccoli as a part of their daily diet. They find its taste quite bitter and feel it ruins their dinner for them. Also, some users believe that the way it's cooked is one of the reasons for not liking the vegetable.18 -  LiverLiver is one of the most hated foods in the US because many people find its texture gross. The way the liver is cooked is different from other forms of meat and may feel a bit chewy or hard if not cooked properly. Moreover, some people do not find its taste as appetizing as any other form of meat. 17 -  AnchoviesAnchovies are another canned seafood that some people may like, and some may not. Anchovies have a very strong taste and smell that may push some people away from them. Going through the comments on Reddit regarding American perception of anchovies, we found out there are people who hate them.16 - TofuTofu is also one of the most hated foods in the US according to Redditors. Users stated that they did not like the texture and taste of tofu once they had it in their mouth. Moreover, most meat lovers have an aversion towards tofu because the latter is a vegan alternative for it, hence they find meat better than it.15 - Sweet TeaSweet tea is a popular drink in the world, especially during the hot summer weather. However, some people on Reddit shared that sweet tea is not a cup of tea. It's too sweet for them and they prefer regular tea over it. A user wrote: ""It's just disgusting."" While not all Americans hate sweet tea, this item was one of those items that some Americans disliked.14 -  Collard GreensCollard greens are mostly used in salads and are a very healthy vegetable. However, humans often tend to dislike food that is healthier for them. Some Reddit users complained about the texture of this vegetable and claimed they did not like it. Moreover, collard greens tend to have a bitter taste, hence most users hating the vegetable said that it affected their whole eating experience, especially in the case of salads. 13 -  SushiSushi is a widely revered food around the globe because of its unique taste and presentation. However, as per our Reddit research, some people in the US completely hate eating sushi. A user on Reddit wrote: “Sushi is awful and overly hyped.” Another user shared that they feel people claim to like sushi due to peer pressure when in reality they do not like its taste. Vermont and Pennsylvania are examples of two states whose people hate sushi. 12 - CilantroCilantro is a widely used herb in many dishes, while some may like it, however, some people simply cannot stand the taste and smell of it. A user on Reddit: ""I dislike several foods but with cilantro, it makes me absolutely disgusted whenever I have it in my mouth."" People who don't like cilantro stated that it tastes like soap, and this is something they would definitely not want in their mouth.11 - OlivesOlives are the joy of a Turkish breakfast table; however, you might be surprised to know that many people living in the US do not like to eat them. Some Americans on Reddit said that they find the flavor of olives a bit too strong for their liking and, hence do not like to have them on their pizzas, in sandwiches, or even as it is. The most common comments were that people cannot stand them at all and they ruin their food for them. A user wrote: “Absolutely vile.”10 - SpamAmericans have a love-hate relationship with spam, however, many people living in the US do not like spam. One of the reasons they do not like it is because of its texture and salty flavor. Even the look of spam makes them drop the idea of having it. They consider it gross and most of them do not prefer canned meat, which is spam. A Reddit user shared: “Even the thought of it makes me wanna gag.”9 - RanchAnother food condiment that most Americans do not like is Ranch. A person on Reddit wrote: ""I hate it."" Ranch is a bit tangy in taste and has an overpowering flavor which most people do not like. People who do not like ranches say that it kind of overshadows the taste of the food they are eating and, hence cannot fully enjoy it.8 - Onions Onions are our 8th most hated food in the US. They may be a huge part of cooking, especially in South Asian cuisine, however, many Americans stated that they do not like the taste of them. One Reddit user stated that they would make their food without onions, and it would taste much better. However, one thing we noticed about this hate for onions was that people hate raw onions more than cooked ones. A Reddit user wrote: “I hate raw onion because the moment I bite into it, they would like to spit it out.”Click to continue reading and see the 7 Most Hated Food in the US According to Reddit.Suggested Articles:12 Worst Performing Fast Food Chains In America16 Most Popular Breakfast Foods in America20 Countries with the Best Food in the WorldDisclosure: none. 20 Most Hated Foods in the US According to Reddit is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

301,c947afdc-1db4-39ed-bccc-d8806d6465a8,BSX,2023-08-25,Boston Scientific (BSX) Expands Globally Amid FX Concerns,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-bsx-expands-globally-144000030.html,1692888000,STORY,"['BSX', 'HAE']","[Boston Scientific BSX is gaining traction in the emerging markets. Also, accretive acquisitions and significant progress in terms of innovation buoy optimism. Yet, unfavorable currency movement and macroeconomic concerns are major dampeners. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Boston Scientific continues to expand its operations across different geographies outside the United States. In 2022, 40% of the company’s consolidated revenues came from international regions.Among its international regions, the company is particularly focusing on expanding its foothold in emerging markets. In Europe, Middle East and Africa too, Boston Scientific is successfully expanding its base, banking on its diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand.Boston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation PriceBoston Scientific Corporation price | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteFollowing the pandemic-led mayhem, Boston Scientific is consistently registering fast recovery within its MedSurg segment. The Endoscopy business within MedSurg is gaining from strong worldwide demand for its broad range of gastrointestinal and pulmonary treatment options. Within Urology, Boston Scientific continues to expand market share globally. The company’s Stone management franchise is growing well, led by LithoVue Single-Use Digital Flexible Ureteroscope System.Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum, banking on the strong performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device.We are also impressed with Boston Scientific’s several recent acquisitions that have added numerous products (though many are under development) with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term.In April 2023, Boston Scientific closed the Apollo Endosurgery acquisition. It will further the company’s category leadership strategy within the growing area of endoluminal surgery with differentiated technologies like OverStitch and xTAC and provide entry into the adjacent endobariatric market.Story continuesOver the past year, Boston Scientific has outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 22.3% against the industry’s 3.5% dip.On the flip side, the industry-wide trend of challenging macroeconomic conditions in the form of inflation, disruptions in economic activity, global supply chains and labor markets, volatile financial market dynamics and significant volatility in price and availability of goods and services are putting pressure on Boston Scientific’s profitability.Further, international conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war and tension between China-Taiwan, have increased cybersecurity risks on a global basis.With Boston Scientific recording 40% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the last few quarters as in the case of other important MedTech players too.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and SiBone SIBN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

302,36db46bc-c8b4-4cf2-84cb-5a10ded5a663,COF,2023-08-25,Another thing for banks to 'worry about': Credit card delinquencies,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-thing-for-banks-to-worry-about-credit-card-delinquencies-150242637.html,1692889362,STORY,"['BAC', 'M', 'ALLY', 'FL', 'COF', 'COF-PK', 'COF-PL', 'COF-PN']","[The big worry for banks after the turmoil that roiled the industry in the spring was commercial real estate. Now there is a new concern: credit card delinquencies.Overall credit card debt topped $1 trillion as of the end of the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Credit card delinquencies climbed to 7.2%, reaching 2019 levels. Auto loans rose to 7.3%, also reaching pre-pandemic levels.Read more: How to consolidate credit card debt with a personal loanNew warnings about consumers came this week from several retailers who said customers were already having trouble paying off their credit card debt.Macy’s (M) reported card sales dropped 36% from the prior year with the retailer’s CFO warning of ""higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs."" Footlocker (FL) fell 28% Wednesday after the retailer suspended its dividend, citing a need to compete for ""price-sensitive consumers.""The return of student loan repayments in October could also make financial matters worse for some consumers, forcing them to pull back on their spending in other areas such as credit card repayments.Loan losses from credit cards and auto loans are ""the big issue that certain banks have to worry about"" now instead of commercial real estate, Dick Bove, a bank analyst for Odeon Capital, told Yahoo Finance.Because of these concerns Bove downgraded Capital One (COF), which relies heavily on credit card income, to a Sell rating earlier this year. He did the same to online bank Ally Financial (ALLY), which has a lot of auto loans.“I think we’re going to see a wave of loan losses for both these companies in these areas,” he said.To be sure, credit card loans make up only a small portion of the total loans and leases and total assets held by US commercial banks. As of the week ending Aug. 9, according to the Federal Reserve, credit card loans accounted for 8.2% of all loans and 4.4% of all assets, respectively.Story continuesAnd even though credit card delinquencies at banks have been steadily rising since the second half of 2021, delinquencies had previously fallen during the pandemic to their lowest rate since 1991, according to Fed data.“We're coming off really low delinquencies prior to this. So you're going to see a natural uptick,” Smead Capital Management CEO Cole Smead told Yahoo Finance.Alexander Yokum, a bank analyst for CFRA, said he is ""not that concerned"" about how rising card balances and delinquencies could impact the lenders he follows ""with unemployment under 4%.""""The consumer is still in pretty good shape,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income told Yahoo Finance, noting that underneath the surface consumers on the ""lower end"" may be facing the brunt of current financial difficulties.To be sure, there is little doubt banks are bracing for losses to increase. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) increased the provisions they set aside for possible future loan losses by 17% between the first and second quarters.For the first half of the year, they have accumulated $13.3 billion, a 42% increase compared to the first half of 2022.Some banks are also pulling back on this type of lending. Consumer loan growth at US commercial banks in July was 5.9%, a decline from a 7.3% rate in June and 10.8% at the start of the year.For credit card and other revolving consumer plans, growth has cooled to half of its pace from a year ago.""The trend is very negative,"" Yokum said of the rising delinquencies in credit cards. ""If elevated, interest rates end up pushing the economy into recession. That's a much bigger issue, but that the case of a recession has been receding, not really increasing over the last few quarters,"" he added.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Dave?Story continuesDavid C. KimbellThank you, Kiley, and good afternoon. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, gross profit and SG&amp;A expenses all better than planned.Net sales increased 10.1% to $2.5 billion, and comparable sales increased 8%. Operating profit was 15.5% of sales and diluted EPS increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share. In addition to delivering great financial results, our teams executed against our operational priorities. During the quarter, we drove growth across all major categories, increased the number of loyalty program members, strengthened our brand engagement and achieved important milestones within our multiyear transformation initiatives.Through the first half, our financial results are ahead of our internal expectations, and I remain confident we can deliver against our updated guidance for fiscal 2023. I want to express my sincere appreciation to all Ulta Beauty associates for their continued commitment to delivering great guest experiences while working collaboratively to execute our ambitious transformational agenda.Starting with the discussion of our operational results, we saw strong sales -- solid sales performance across both our store and digital channels, driven by double-digit traffic growth. All major categories delivered comp growth for the quarter, supported by strong engagement with the overall beauty category, compelling product newness and innovation and successful execution of cross-category promotional events, including our reimagined Big Summer Beauty Sale.Building on last year's promotional events, we consolidated key summer events like our popular Jumbo Love and Mix &amp; Match Minis into a broader, more cohesive event with holistic storytelling and impactful messaging. The 3-week long Big Summer Beauty Sale drove market disruption, member conversion and strong sales across our hair care, makeup and skin care categories.Turning to performance by category. Skin care continues to be 1 of our strongest categories, even as we lap unprecedented growth during the pandemic. For the quarter, both Prestige and mass skin care delivered double-digit growth. Newer brands, including Bubble, BIOMA and Beautycounter and innovation from existing brands like The Ordinary, Drunk Elephant and Supergoop! contributed to the strong sales results. Reflecting consumer interest in dermatologist recommended brands, La Roche-Posay and CeraVe continued to perform well, and brands like Good Molecules, Hero Cosmetics and Peach Slices continue to benefit from social virality.The fragrance and bath category delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Layering and wardrobing scents as a form of self-expression, especially among Gen Z consumers, continues to drive category engagement. Newness from Ariana Grande, Valentino and Burberry contributed to the category's performance, and key gift-giving events like Mother's Day and Father's Day drove growth for luxury brands like Carolina Herrera, Chanel and YSL.The hair care category delivered mid-single-digit comp growth driven by newness and guest engagement with our strategic events. Hair care focused on bonding, scalp treatments and other repair solutions as well as products that offer healthy heat styling options continue to drive consumer engagement. Trend-relevant products from professional brands, Redken, Biolage and Matrix as well as newness from prestige brands, (inaudible) and IGK resonated strongly. New brands, including exclusive brands LolaVie, created by Jennifer Anderson, and Donna's Recipe also contributed to growth this quarter. While still challenged as we lap several years of strong growth, sales trends in hair tools improved from the first quarter, driven by compelling newness from Dyson and innovation from Bio Ionic.Finally, makeup delivered low single-digit comp growth, driven by strong performance in mass cosmetics. New brands like Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter drove growth during the quarter, while new and exclusive products from a wide range of brands, including e.l.f, NYX and OPI also contributed positively. Compelling events, including our Big Summer Beauty Sale, National Lipstick Week and our foundation event as well as successful Barbie and Little Mermaid collaborations drove guest engagement. While the performance of mass cosmetics benefited from engaging newness in social content, our prestige makeup business was challenged as we lapped the significant impact of the Fenty launch last year.Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth again this quarter, primarily driven by increased appointments. Guests are engaging in core cut, color and blowout services as well as newer services, including extensions and scalp and hair treatments. We continue to enhance our service offering, and this quarter, we launched ear piercings chain-wide and introduced a new Keratin Express treatment.The beauty category growth remains healthy across both prestige and mass price tiers as consumers maintain their post-pandemic routines and expand their definition of beauty. When we look at the total beauty market, our analysis demonstrates we continue to gain market share. In mass beauty, we gained share this quarter across all major categories. In prestige, we continue to drive solid gains in skin and fragrance but saw pressure in makeup and hair based on Circana's beauty sales data.Our proprietary insights suggest consumers are becoming less focused on product pricing tiers and are trading around, choosing to engage with brands that offer on-trend newness and compelling social media content. As the only beauty retailer to offer a curated assortment of products from entry-level mass to luxury and everything in between, we are uniquely positioned to capture share of the total beauty market as consumers shift. We remain confident in the resilience of beauty. Our strategic framework guides our priorities and positions us to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth.Let me share some highlights of the progress we made against this framework in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. Newness and innovation are critical growth drivers for beauty. Newness comes to life in the form of new brands, products and product lines, shade extensions and reformulations, and fuels discovery and drive trips and engagement. As we seek to continuously delight guests with all Things Beauty, we continue to expand our assortment and innovate -- with innovative and emerging brands.Building on newness introduced in the first half, we have several exciting launches planned for the third quarter, including Half Magic, a vegan and cruelty-free makeup brand created by Euphoria makeup artist Donni Davy, exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Polite Society, a prestige makeup brand exclusive to Ulta Beauty curated -- created by the founders of Too Faced Cosmetics. Rabanne, a contemporary and relevant Spanish fashion brand launching cosmetics exclusively at Ulta Beauty. Hair styling tools at accessible price points from Shark Beauty; PanOxyl, a dermatologist recommended brand popular with Gen Z; and Sniff, an emerging fragrance band offering gender neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.Reflecting the growth and popularity of luxury products with younger generations, last quarter, we launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty in 200 stores and on ulta.com. The program has exceeded our expectations, and we continue to see strong guest engagement with our offerings across all categories. Building on this success, we are excited to launch Pat McGrath Labs, a BIPOC luxe artistry makeup brand. Pat McGrath is a trusted expert who has shaped and disrupted the cosmetic category.Now, let me share an update on our key cross-category platforms, which lean into broader emerging trends in beauty, products that are good for the world, inclusivity and wellness. As we seek to provide guests with a diverse assortment that reflects their personal values and individual needs, we continue to expand our assortment of brands featuring clean, cruelty-free and vegan ingredients, leveraging sustainable packaging and driving positive impact through our Conscious Beauty platform.At the end of the quarter, 314 brands were certified in at least 1 pillar, with more than 270 brands certified in multiple pillars. To ensure all guests feel connected and reflected at Ulta Beauty, we continue our important efforts to drive inclusivity. In addition to amplifying our portfolio of BIPOC brands through informative marketing and in-store presentations, this quarter, we hosted a summit for our BIPOC brands, providing them with opportunities to network with peers while learning more about the beauty industry and operational best practices.Lastly, as the importance of beauty as a form of self-care and wellness continues to build, we enhanced the wellness shop assortment with the launch of 2 exciting supplements: Lemme Gummies created by Kourtney Kardashian, and the introduction of Big Brain Probiotics from Love Wellness.Turning now to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we are enhancing guest experiences across all of our touch points. Guests continue to shift effortlessly between physical and digital channels, depending on their individual needs, and we are committed to meeting them wherever they are in their beauty journey. Reflecting our efforts to enhance our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities, we have expanded our same-day delivery option to essentially every store and improved our store fulfillment process to drive greater efficiency and speed.Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship from store capabilities, 31% of our e-commerce sales and 39% of our digital orders were fulfilled by our store teams this quarter. Our consumer insights and member data confirm the importance of physical shopping in beauty. More than 75% of our members choose to transact with us only in stores, and yet we know many of these members use our digital platforms for discovery, try-on and inspiration. Converting these members to omnichannel members is a meaningful opportunity to increase engagement and spend per member as omnichannel shoppers spend 2.5x to 3x more than single channel shoppers.Importantly, the increase in spend is largely incremental.Expanded engagement with our mobile app is 1 way we are driving omnichannel conversion. Through our digital store refresh, we enhanced the user search and discovery experience, seamlessly blending commerce and content for a more personalized experience. We also continue to expand and enhance our digital try-on capabilities. This quarter, we launched a virtual try-on tool that enables guests to try multiple nail looks simultaneously, and we upgraded our virtual hair try-on experience with expanded color options and enhanced transfer quality and speed. These enhancements, combined with awareness campaigns, unique offers to drive utilization and increased associate education have delivered meaningful growth.Over the last 12 months, 9 million active members have engaged with our mobile app, double the number of members who engaged with the app before the pandemic. And we're seeing stronger engagement, with more than 55% of e-commerce sales coming through our mobile app.Turning to our partnership with Target. We opened 62 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 421 shops. Our marketing teams work closely with our target partners to build awareness for newer brands, including Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande Fragrances, Glamnetic, and Living Proof, while also amplifying Summer prestige Must-Haves and minis. As the partnership scales, we are learning more about the Ulta Beauty at Target guests and the role this touchpoint plays in their beauty journey, and we will continue to leverage our expertise to develop unique assortments that reflect the preferences of the Ulta Beauty at Target guests.Moving to our third strategic pillar, operating at the Heart of the Beauty community, we are focused on driving greater love, loyalty and emotional connection with Ulta Beauty. We began this quarter with a Mother's Day campaign that highlighted exclusive cross-category gifts, including our luxury assortment and hero fragrances. Moving into June, we positioned Ulta Beauty as the destination for Summer Beauty, driving top-of-mind awareness and traffic with compelling points offers and special deals across the assortment to celebrate our members.Finally, we closed the quarter with our Big Summer Beauty Sale, a bold and disruptive event that offered opportunities to save on fan favorite beauty items across all categories and price points from a variety of established and emerging brands. These key events, paired with our culturally-relevant content amplifications drove record-level highs in unaided awareness with our greatest gains among Gen Z consumers.Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 41.7 million active members, 9% higher than last year, driven by strong member acquisition and reactivation, combined with healthy retention of existing members. Spend per member also increased, driven by greater shopper frequency. The strength of our loyalty program continues to be a powerful and differentiated strategic asset for Ulta Beauty, and we are pleased with its elevated growth and performance.Our continued efforts to nurture the member life cycle is driving results. We accelerated new member acquisition and continue to engage and retain members with meaningful events, compelling points offers, personalized content and special guests. These strategies also delivered growth in our Diamond and Platinum tiers, which increased nearly 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting strong loyalty and engagement with all Ulta Beauty offers.Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing an ambitious multiyear road map of transformation initiatives intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our future growth. As we have discussed on previous calls, we are expanding and optimizing our supply chain, upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform, transitioning our digital store to a new platform, enhancing our data management systems and upgrading store POS systems.I am pleased to share that our teams have delivered several key milestones. Our new Greer, South Carolina market fulfillment center began receiving inventory last month, and we expect to start shipping to stores next week. We completed the installation of a new automated storage and retrieval system in our Greenwood distribution center, which will increase capacity and enable greater productivity. We expanded our ship from store capabilities to an additional 276 stores. Today, we fulfill e-commerce orders from 400 strategically-located stores, enabling faster, more cost-effective delivery to the guest. We successfully transitioned 2 distribution centers, Jacksonville and Greer, to our new ERP platform.As part of our digital store transformation, we successfully completed a large-scale upgrade of our end-to-end e-commerce platform and migrated to a new modernized platform that includes a new promotion engine, guest account, cart and checkout. This is a significant milestone in our multiyear effort to elevate our digital experience in a way that positions us for long-term growth in this critical channel.Finally, we completed the POS upgrade in all stores. While our transformation agenda is not finished, we have made significant progress, and I am proud of how our teams have worked to execute our plans while limiting disruption to guests and associates.Looking forward, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment. While consumer confidence has strengthened, there are signs pointing to moderating growth going forward. Many consumers have begun to reduce overall spending, credit card debt remains high and the restart of student loan repayments is approaching. It is unclear how these factors will impact consumer behavior in the near term, but despite these factors, beauty has remained a bright spot. Based on Circana beauty sales data, total U.S. beauty sales for the first half of 2023 increased double digits compared to the same period last year, with prestige beauty channels delivering higher growth than mass beauty channels. Looking to the rest of the year, we believe growth for the U.S. beauty market will remain healthy but normalize into the mid-single digits as we lap 2 years of strong growth, experienced less impact from pricing and face more economic uncertainty.As category growth normalizes, we continue to expect promotional activity within the category will also normalize. Over the last 2 years, unprecedented category growth and strong demand limited promotional activity. As a result, the promotional environment in 2021 and 2022 was unsustainably low. Reflecting these factors, we planned for higher promotional activity this year but continue to expect promotions will remain well below 2019 levels.In closing, we operate in an attractive and growing category. We have a strong, proven business model and a winning culture and outstanding teams. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we have exceeded our internal financial expectations, and we remain confident we can deliver our updated expectations for the rest of the year.And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?Scott M. SetterstenThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave shared, we delivered second quarter financial results that were ahead of our expectations. Strong sales growth supported by healthy guest engagement and strong in-store sales performance drove better-than-expected gross margin. SG&amp;A spend was also lower than planned, resulting in an operating margin of 15.5%. Turning to the P&amp;L. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.1%, driven by 8% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenues. Transactions for the quarter increased 9%, primarily, driven by healthy traffic on both channels. Average ticket decreased 1% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of higher average selling price. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by the impact of retail price increases, many of which were executed last year. We estimate price increases contributed about 300 basis points to the overall comp.During the quarter, we opened 3 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 3 stores. Second quarter gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 39.3% compared to 40.4% last year. The decrease was driven by lower merchandise margin, an increase in inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs. Overall merchandise margin was lower due primarily to increased promotional activity, unfavorable category mix and less benefit from the timing of retail price changes. While promotional activity continues to normalize, it is important to note that overall promotions remain well below 2019 levels.Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind this quarter. Our efforts to address shrink are having an impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. Today, we have the new fragrance fixtures in more than 50% of our stores and expect to have these installed in 70% of the fleet by year-end. We remain focused on taking action in areas we can control, including continued investment in fixtures, associate training, staffing as well as operational improvements, and leveraging our influence to enact broader changes that will disincentivize unlawful behavior.Supply chain costs were higher, primarily driven by ongoing investments in our supply chain transformation as we made progress on the retrofit of our Dallas and Greenwood distribution centers and prepared to open our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs due to top line sales growth.SG&amp;A increased 12.4% to $600.7 million. SG&amp;A increased 40 basis points to 23.7% compared to 23.3% last year. The increase in SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was driven by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments, planned increases in store payroll and benefits and higher store expenses, which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expense deleveraged in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, other IT capabilities and UB Media.Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have invested a little less than half of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned growth in average wage rates and increased staffing levels compared to the same period last year. Incentive compensation was a tailwind in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance.Operating income for the quarter was $391.6 million, flat to last year. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 150 basis points to 15.5% compared to 17% last year. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 5.6% to $6.02 per share compared to $5.70 per share last year.Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 9% to $1.82 billion compared to $1.67 billion last year, in addition to the impact of 37 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand, increases in product costs and new brand launches.Capital expenditures were $95 million for the quarter compared to $49.4 million last year. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to investments in IT and supply chain to support our transformational agenda as well as merchandising investments to support the rollout of our luxury assortment and brand expansions.Depreciation was $61.9 million in the quarter compared to $60.9 million last year. We ended the quarter with $388.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 594,000 shares at a cost of $275.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $559 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $541 million remaining under our current $2 billion repurchase authorization.Moving to our outlook. We are updating our guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our better-than-expected second quarter performance. We have raised our top line expectations and now project net sales will be between $11.05 million and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 4.5% and 5.5%. Our updated outlook reflects our strong first half performance while continuing to consider risks and uncertainties that could impact demand in the second half of the year, including rising consumer debt levels and the expected resumption of student loan repayments. We continue to expect comps will moderate to the low single digits in the second half of the year, and we remain on track to open 25 to 30 new stores and renovate or relocate 20 to 30 stores this year.Reflecting our year-to-date performance, we've raised the low end of the range of operating margin and now expect operating margins for the year will be between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come fairly evenly from both gross margin and SG&amp;A. Our expectations reflect the continuation of the trends we experienced through the first half of the year around shrink, promotional activity and supply chain costs as well as greater headwind from lapping the merchandise margin benefits from the timing of retail price increases last year.For modeling purposes, we expect third quarter operating margin will be meaningfully more pressured than what we saw in the second quarter as we lap greater pricing benefits in the third quarter last year as well as a shift of investment spending from Q2 to Q3. As a result, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter will be lower than last year.Reflecting these updated assumptions, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year will be between $25.10 and $25.60. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. We anticipate the additional week will add between $165 million to $175 million in sales and approximately $0.40 of earnings per share. In closing, our results through the first 6 months of fiscal 2023 highlights the ongoing power and resilience of our business model.I'd like to thank our associates for their dedication and commitment to keeping our guests at the center of all we do and giving them more reasons to shop Ulta Beauty. As we look to the future, we are focused on capitalizing on the growth opportunities in the beauty category and executing our strategic framework to deliver long-term sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ashley Helgans with Jefferies.Ashley Elizabeth HelgansTo start, maybe any details you can share on how traffic progressed throughout the quarter and what you're seeing now in August? And then also on the fragrances being locked up, have you seen any adverse effects on sales?David C. KimbellYes. Ashley, for the quarter, we saw strong traffic throughout the quarter with double-digit traffic. And we continue to be pleased with the engagement that we're seeing, and we saw actual comp performance sequentially accelerate through the quarter as well. And all of those trends are reflected into our updated and elevated guidance for the full year. On fragrance, the -- I'll let Kecia kind of discuss what we're doing in fragrance and how that's impacting our business.Kecia L. SteelmanYes. Actually, we've locked up about 50% of our stores right now. And what we're seeing is in the initial stores that we rolled out the locked fragrance cases for, we actually saw sales improvement because we were in stock with the product and we had it available to the guests. So we're staying very close to that. We're also investing in labor because we don't want to be sales preventative from the guests being able to purchase. So that's a little bit of the investment in labor that you heard earlier from Scott, is that in these stores, we are upping our labor a bit because we want to make sure that we're able to take care of the guests. So we're staying close to it. The bottom line is that we're pleased that we're able to maintain our in-stock for our guests, and quite frankly, keep the bad actors [out] from coming into our stores.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.Michael Allen BakerI'm just curious, you said you expect the beauty industry to grow mid-single digits, yet you're only expecting comps to be up low single digits. And even if you add in store growth, you're still expecting to grow maybe up, but seemingly below the industry. I don't suppose you guys think you're losing share, so I'm just wondering if you can help flesh that out a little bit?David C. KimbellYes, I'd say, yes, we do anticipate continuing to gain share. We've done so through the first half of the year, and that is our outlook. The commentary is really as we look into the second half of the year, we see some strength. Engagement continues to be high. Certainly, our business is performing very well. We're attracting new members. We're growing across all key categories, both -- and then in both e-com and stores. But we also see some uncertainty as we get in later into the year.So while we're confident in the category, we're just incorporating into our outlook some full -- some of that. And for the full year, we're looking at revenue in the plus 8% to 9% range, so we anticipate gaining share for the year being ahead of the total category growth. That's -- that will be our plan.OperatorOur next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James.Olivia Tong CheangMy first question is around prestige versus mass breakout, because you mentioned in skin that you're still seeing strong growth in both prestige and mass. But only in mass for makeup, but you mentioned that the launch of Fenty a year ago was a big contributor. So if you exclude that, are you seeing anything different there? And then going forward, as you think about your expectations on growth in mass versus prestige, what implications may that have on comp, in your view?David C. KimbellWhat was the last part of that question? What was -- could you repeat the last...Olivia Tong CheangYes. Just the implication on comp, if -- what you're thinking in terms of growth of mass versus prestige across your stores? And what implications that might have in terms of comp if mass becomes a bigger piece of the driver of growth?David C. KimbellWell, yes, we -- as I discussed, we've seen strong performance really across our entire assortment as we look at it, but mass has been a bit stronger for a couple of quarters now in -- across our business. And that's driven largely by strong consumer engagement across some key brands in makeup, health, NYX and some others are really hitting the market with great innovation, great marketing, great consumer engagement. And the fact that we offer the full assortment from mass to prestige is a real benefit. We're able to capitalize on strong trends and strong engagements across all aspects of that. In skin care, we're seeing brands, particularly in the dermatologist recommended area driving strong growth, and that's great, we -- strong player for us. As we look forward, it's always our intent to continue to adapt and adjust and lean into the areas that are driving growth, find ways to strengthen those that may be more challenged, but we're confident in the outlook going forward. And the fact that we have both is unique. Of course you know that, but the fact that we're the only ones that offer mass, masstige, prestige and a growing, established now, business in luxury.We're seeing strong points across all. We'll continue to flex and adapt and incorporate it into our comp guidance is our ability to continue to drive growth. But through the first half of the year, we're really pleased with the Mass performance and several brands driving strong growth, and continue to lean in and bring innovation into the prestige side of the business. And collectively, it's working to allow us to gain share across Ulta Beauty.OperatorOur next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Kate is your line on mute?Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.Anthony Chinonye ChukumbaCongrats on the solid results. So just a real quick one. You mentioned luxury, and in fact, it's exceeding your expectations. You mentioned launching Pat McGrath Labs. Just -- it's all one related question in just 2 parts. First off, what -- is luxury -- what percentage of your assortment, I guess, is luxury in the stores that it's in? And is it big enough at this point to be a comp driver?David C. KimbellYes. Won't break out exact percentages. Again, to reiterate, it's in 200 stores. We're really pleased with it, a strong assortment across a number of the very best brands in luxury. Chanel, Dior, NATASHA DENONA, HOURGLASS, an extension of Chanel with Chanel Número Uno, Lancôme, Absolute, now Pat McGrath. A luxury fragrance business with brands like YSL and TOM FORD and Viktor&amp;Rolf.So we won't get into exact percentages, but it is an important part of our overall strategy. We know there's growth in the luxury side of the business. We've been in luxury for a while, but now with this expanded presence, it is a contributor to our total comp. We're excited about the addition of Pat McGrath, and we'll continue to innovate and evolve and find ways to drive further growth down the road. So yes, we think it's -- we know it's contributing to our growth, and we're excited about our guest response to an expanded luxury experience.OperatorOur next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.Christopher Michael HorversLayered gross margin question. So how did shrink in the promotional environment play out in the second quarter relative to your expectations? Have you changed any of your expectations around those line items in the back half? And do you expect any improvement perhaps in the shrink line?And then Scott, could you remind us of the price cost headwind that we faced in the third quarter? Because I know that was pretty significant last year.Scott M. SetterstenSure, Chris. So yes, versus -- we did say, again, versus our expectations for the quarter, we're very happy with the overall financial results we were able to deliver. So breaking it down a little bit more, I'd say merchandise margin was better than what we expected, and so that speaks partially to the promotional lever that people are focused on here. So again, generally better than what we expected, so we can lean in and lean out. That's 1 of the great strengths of our business, being able to have real-time information and be able to take quick action and be agile.I'd say shrink generally directionally about the same as what we saw in the first quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year, we don't really -- we're not anticipating a significant turn and expectations there. We expect it to be tough the rest of the way. And we'll say maybe the fourth quarter may be slightly less negative than it was early part of the year because remember, last year in the fourth quarter was the first time we really called out and quantified what the shrink impact was, so we did have a little bit of a catch-up there. Over -- and then fixed -- store fixed costs we talked about, that was stronger than what we -- going in expectation because sales were a bit stronger than what we thought. And then channel mix overall helped us as well. As we look to think about gross margin the second half of the year, I'd say the drivers, the headwinds are consistent with what we've seen in the first half of 2023. Again, we're taking a prudent approach as we always do with our guidance, and we'll work hard to do better than that.Christopher Michael HorversAnd then the price cost in 3Q?Scott M. SetterstenYes. So there was -- we -- third quarter last year is where we saw a significant step-up in the pricing increases across the portfolio, and really, the margin benefit started really rolling through in the second quarter and into the back half of the year. So this is really the toughest anniversary point in the year is ahead of us right now, and that's why we're calling out third quarter. Third quarter is kind of peak on a number of different fronts. Again, every year is a little unique, but the third quarter now, we've got a little bit of delays in some of our project work, which is shifting back some of our IT expense into the third quarter. And a lot of that flows through SG&amp;A.So we'll see more pressure there than we saw earlier in the year, and then likewise, with gross margin. And a little -- and more moderate sales growth expectations, coupled with cycling over the margin benefits last year from the price increases step up in the back half of the year, putting more pressure on third quarter than maybe some would expect. But again, by the time we get in the fourth quarter and get back to focusing on sales in the holiday, we expect that to bounce back in a healthy manner.OperatorOur next question is from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantScott, I'm going to stay on that topic with the third quarter. If I'm not mistaken, it seems like about $10 million to $12 million of the SG&amp;A spend perhaps is moving into the third quarter. And if we have a little bit more gross margin pressure, does that imply that EPS could be down sort of high single-digit range? Just wondering if I'm in the right ballpark.Scott M. SetterstenYes. We don't want to get into quantifying it specifically, Adrienne. But I'd say directionally, you're in the right zip code. So yes, on the SG&amp;A side, that's roughly kind of the shift back into the third quarter on some of the IT spend. And yes, operating margin is going to be down meaningfully versus what we saw earlier this year, and that's going to result in negative EPS growth year-over-year for the third quarter.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantSuper helpful. And then to just follow through with the SG&amp;A. So can you help us walk through the phases? I know there's 4 phases of Project SOAR and all of the other investments. It seems like you're running sort of dual structures perhaps on some of the DCs and then the website or, let's call it, 1/3 or half of the year. How should we think about that rolling off? Because a lot of this kind of redundancy will go away next year. I know you're not giving guidance, but just to help us shape sort of what SG&amp;A growth looks like last -- next year? Because it seems like it comes down a lot on the consensus. I just want to make sure we have that correct in our mind.Kecia L. SteelmanAdrienne, I'll start, and then I'll kick it over to Scott. So yes, we're in the middle of an ambitious transformational agenda. That's for sure. And part of this is really positioning all parts of the organization for our future efforts, and overall we're really pleased with how our progress is working. But anyone who's taken on this large scale of a project, we definitely have timing shifts that happen because we want to make sure that while we're staying forward, progressing and moving, we are really limited in our distraction and our disruption for our guests and also for our associates. So we've adopted a few of our time lines and have shifted a couple of the projects from Q2 into Q3, and we might even see some shifting from Q3 into Q4, but we're still on track to spend the $60 million to $70 million incremental to the prior year. And while we've got some of those shifts, we still are very confident that we're going to stay with our overall time line and how things wrapped up by the right time line for next year, which is more mid-2024. I'll turn it over to Scott.Scott M. SetterstenYes, and you're exactly right. We're not providing guidance for 2024 here today, but yes, investors should expect that we will cultivate, recoup benefits from the significant investments that we're making in our core systems year 20 -- '22 into '23 and that we're going to see benefits materialized in 2024 and beyond. Again, you've heard us talk about, these are major initiatives here that we expect to see dividends for a number of years into the future, but I would also caution investors just to be prepared. I mean there's -- we are in the business of growing Ulta Beauty for the long term, and so there's plenty of other great growth initiatives out there that we've got in the queue that we're ready to go tackle. As soon as we get through some of more of this, I'd call core transformation work here in '23 and early 2024.OperatorOur next question is from Kelly Crago with Citi.Kelly CragoI just have a couple of quick ones on categories. Just on makeup, it looks like makeup's growth decelerated from high singles in 1Q to mid-single to 2Q. Was that driven by a slowdown -- a subsequent slowdown in prestige? Did both decelerate? And how should we think about makeup growing in 2H? And then just secondly on skin, we've heard from some of the brands that maybe there's slowing growth in that category, but you do under index versus the category overall. So just curious whether that dynamic can help offset maybe some weaknesses that we're seeing or starting to see in skin? And any thoughts on the growth there would be great.David C. KimbellYes. I'd say on makeup, the main driver is while our -- we're bringing a lot of innovation and newness across that prestige portfolio, lapping -- really, one of the biggest launches in the history of Ulta Beauty with Fenty, lapping that fully in the second quarter is probably the biggest driver. We're excited though as we look forward. I mentioned a few launches that we that we have coming out, Rabanne, Pat McGrath, Polite Society, among others that many of which are exclusive to Ulta Beauty and are coming into our business in the second half of the year.But we anticipate as we lap that launch. We'll continue to see pressure on prestige. Mass continues to drive growth behind great innovation, great engagement. And so we're pleased with the total makeup side of the business even as we address some of the pressure in lapping previous launches.In the skin care side, yes, we are -- we have somewhat lower share than we do in makeup, but our -- we have established over time a meaningful share position and the fact that we're able to continue to drive growth is, again, a testament to our model, our ability, the strength we have across price points. We're seeing strong healthy growth in both mass and prestige, really leaning into dermatologist recommended space, and believe that we can continue to drive growth going forward and continue to drive share.The category, we think, is healthy. As I said, with the total beauty category, we do anticipate some moderation. It's unlikely to see double-digit growth forever, but we're leaning in. We've got a great skin business. Our merchants continue to bring strong innovation. Our store teams are doing a great job educating our guests, and we're delivering a lot of growth and we see more coming.OperatorOur next question is from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.Katharine Amanda McShaneThanks for giving me another chance here to ask our question. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the strategy behind combining your promotional events like you did this past quarter? And did you see a bigger lift as a result of that change versus last year? And will there be any similar approaches to some of your promotional events being taken in the second half?David C. KimbellGreat. Yes, I almost used your silence to answer any question that I wanted to (inaudible) the earlier Kate, but glad you got back in the queue. We're excited. We -- I think what we did in the second quarter, what our teams did, our merchant marketing, digital, store teams, our go-to-market teams, really, we -- they are continually evaluating how we can get better and how we can elevate the impact, and the summer sale is an example of that. We had strong events, solid events that were delivering for years, but the team, through great consumer insights, continued understanding of guest behavior and full understanding of what unique strengths we bring to the table, reevaluated that.And we're pleased with the results of that event, the Big Summer Sale as well as, really, our entire promotional strategy. It was not a huge acceleration in promotional intensity as much as a smarter strategy, and it worked. Our guests engaged, we attracted new members, it delivered strong comp growth. We saw strength in both stores and on our e-commerce business traffic was healthy. So it's -- frankly, didn't surprise me because I know how the team continues to look for ways to elevate, and it's another example of great strategy leading to a strong execution. As we look into the second half of the year, we're evaluating, as we always do, every aspect of our go-to-market strategy. We continue to evolve our efforts. We'll adapt competitive changes, consumer insights and make sure we're delivering at a high level. Sunday, Kate, starts 21 Days of Beauty, 1 of our biggest events of the year. And I think you'll see as that rolls out, a program that's been around for a while, continued innovation and ways to engage our guests in new ways, so we're excited to get that going.OperatorOur next question is from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Neil] here on for Oliver. I would love to hear more about your thoughts on the broader beauty consumer. Someone made a comment about consumers are being less focused on pricing and kind of trading around different price points, so just curious how that behavior holds against the different macro headwinds you mentioned, particularly student loans? What's your exposure to that? Or how do you quantify that impact as we get closer to the October time frame when that becomes more material?David C. KimbellYes. Well, I'd say first of all, we're just pleased overall with the continued engagement that beauty enthusiasts are showing for this category. Coming out of the pandemic for these last a couple of years now, just a high level of engagement. You know how over the long term, last 50 years, this has been a strong growth -- consistently growing category because of the emotional connection that it plays in our guest lives, the importance it has and how they express themselves to the world, and that is more true now than ever. And some of the behaviors and engagement tools that emerge coming out of the pandemic continue to fuel the category. Strong innovation, strong connection through marketing and consumer tools and an increased understanding of the role of beauty to wellness and self-care. So when we look at the consumer going forward, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for this category and the strength of the beauty enthusiast to fuel it going forward. As I mentioned in the -- in my comments, there's a lot of uncertainty, and there has been, frankly, for the last couple of years. But we look into the remainder of this year, we know we're lapping. We continue to lap strong growth. We've been on this strong category growth for a while now. We have more changes coming, including student loans. So we're cautious and certainly watching carefully how that evolves.Historically, it's been difficult to tease out any kind of economic or stimulus shift and how directly that impacts the category or our business, and our business and the category itself has been largely resilient. Not immune, but largely resilient. So when we look out, I guess I'd say we're optimistic but watching closely and carefully. Staying really close to our guests, understanding what's happening in their lives and what's influencing their decisions and making sure we're adapting. Last thing I'd say, and I know I've said this many times, but our position, our unique model of having all price points and a really accessible experience, both in-store and online positions us well. So even if there's shifts, even if there are pressures on consumers, history says we are able to adapt, and I know that's the strategy that we're implementing to make sure we're here for our guests to deliver regardless of what goes on in the broader environment around them.Kiley F. RawlinsPaul, I think we have time for maybe one more question.OperatorOur final question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.Steven Paul ForbesDave, Scott, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks the expectation for promotions to remain well below 2019 levels. And I was hoping you could just maybe clarify that statement? Is it isolated in 2023? Or is it meant to be a longer-term comment? And as we think about merchandise margin risk in the model, any way to frame what the sort of structural change in promotional activity in the category means for the margin profile in and of itself?Scott M. SetterstenYes. So when we're talking -- again, this has been an evergreen topic, I think, with investors now for quite a while, pointing back to 2019. So the business is in a much different position today than it was back in 2019. Again, for those that have been following 2019, we had some major disruption in the middle of the year in the makeup category, unexpected deceleration there. There were channel mix headwinds that we were dealing with as a business. There was some investment in some international expansion that was causing some significant deleverage on the business. And so during the course of the pandemic some initiatives that have been started pre-pandemic but during the pandemic, we were able to take advantage of making sure that we fully leverage some of our cost optimization initiatives by way of EFG, and now continuous improvement initiatives layered on top of that.I would say the scale of the business, much larger today than it was back in 2019. So we're going to get the benefit of the fixed store cost leverage in the base business far and above what we were looking at pre-pandemic. Things around our capabilities like ship from store and BOPIS capabilities that really did not exist in any meaningful way back in 2019 that now you heard us say again today. 30% of those digital sales are being serviced out of our store fleet, so a much more efficient delivery to the consumer and a much better overall margin profile of those sales. Things like our credit card program, our Ulta Beauty and Target relationship, UB Media, new business for us, just really out of the starting gate here over the course of the last year, puts us in a much better position overall than we were back in those days. So again, that's not promotion directly, but those -- all those elements play a role in gross margin and operating margin and expanding that over the course of time. So we feel confident that the promotion levels, again, they are going to moderate. We've been talking over the last couple of years that extraordinary environment that we saw in '21 and '22 was not sustainable for the long term. And that -- as people got back in the business and people were back in malls and other retail outlets that the promotion level was probably going to come back to us a little bit, and that's kind of how -- what we're seeing play out today. So again, there's nothing unexpected here. It was in our forecast, our plans for the year. We're moderating and navigating our way through that in an effective manner, and again, nothing -- I don't think anything that should be overly concerning to investors. Again, we're confident that we're going to be able to manage our way through that with new capabilities, new lines of business, our loyalty program and CRM capabilities being much more mature today than they were back in the pre-pandemic days.So we're confident, we're going to be able to deliver healthy operating margins in that 14% to 15% range and a very moderate growth expectation of 3% to 5%. So feeling good about our position and where we're headed for the future.David C. KimbellGreat. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate your interest and engagement in Ulta Beauty. I want to close by thanking all of our Ulta Beauty associates for their continued care for our guests while delivering another quarter of strong financial results. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the third quarter on November 30. Thanks again, and have a good evening.OperatorThis concludes today's conference.

Never be left in the dust again.Nvidia's blazing quarterNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) obliterated Wall Street expectations for Q2 and full-year revenue guidance as demand for its chips remains sky-high amid the race to adopt generative artificial intelligence.Shares climbed as high as 6.6% to $502.66 in Thursday's regular session after the post-close Wednesday print - an all-time high for Nvidia - although the stock retreated to a marginal gain at $471.63 by the end of the day.The chipmaker recorded earnings of $2.70 per share, $0.67 better than consensus, on revenue of $13.51 billion vs. the $11.13B average analyst estimate. Embedded in the sales number was a 171% surge in its high-margin data center business as businesses transition to accelerated computing and generative AI from general-purpose computing.The chipmaker also unveiled an additional $25B stock buyback plan.As AI demand ramps up, Nvidia's suite of AI-related products has become the dominant option for AI-minded startups and businesses. The chipmaker said it expects supply to rise each quarter through next year, and in particular expects Q3 sales of about $16B, give or take 2%, well above the $12B consensus.That ebullient guidance, said Wedbush in a note to clients, ""will be fuel in the engine to ignite a tech rally we see continuing into the rest of the year despite the recent pullback and Fed jitters.""Stifel upgraded Nvidia to Buy from Hold with a price target of $600 on the ""exceptional"" quarter, saying, ""we underestimated the opportunity related to the potential shift of $1 trillion of installed data center infrastructure from general purpose compute to accelerated compute architectures.""Story continuesMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs maintained their buy ratings on the stock, with the former calling Q2 ""another exceptional quarter"" and Goldman writing, ""We expect Nvidia to maintain its status as the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future.""And a notable Nvidia bull at Rosenblatt hiked the price target to an eye-popping $1,100 per share, opining, ""Nvidia’s epic print and guide two quarters in a row is simply unprecedented and just getting started.""Marvell Technology's dull printElsewhere in tech, investors were deflated when Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) posted merely in-line guidance and a slightly better-than-expected fiscal Q2.Shares were down some 5% in Friday's premarket following the post-bell Thursday print, extending on a nearly 7% slide in the prior regular session.Q2 earnings came in at $0.33 per share, a penny better than consensus, and revenue of $1.34B - down 12% from a year earlier - was a hair above the $1.33B Street estimate. For fiscal Q3, Marvell anticipates earnings of $0.40 per share on $1.4B in revenue.CEO Matt Murphy said the growth implied in those expectations ""is being driven primarily by AI and cloud infrastructure.""Snowflake falls despite a big earnings beatCloud concern Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), meanwhile, reported earnings of $0.22 per share after the bell Wednesday, more than double the average Street estimate, on far better-than-expected sales of $674 million - up 36% year-over-year.The company also maintained full-year guidance.BTIG said Snowflake's results were solid and that its ""long-term story is compelling on multiple levels,"" but maintained its Neutral rating on the stock, saying it sees ""a balanced risk/reward"" at current levels.Shares foundered Thursday, losing 5.2% to $147.67.Zoom ahead on earnings; shares take a dipFinally, after the bell Monday, video-chat purveyor Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) said it earned $1.34 per share in its fiscal Q2, well ahead of the $1.06 average estimate, on better-than-expected sales of $1.14.Fiscal Q3 EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.09 was ahead of the $1.03 consensus, and sales are expected at an in-line $1.115B to $1.12B.Needham &amp; Company maintained its Hold rating on the stock, writing, ""we are cautious on meaningful re-acceleration until product diversification improves.""Zoom shares were down more than 2% Tuesday.Ulta, Gap, and Nordstrom deliver better-than-anticipated profitsUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) beat on its Q2 print and full-year guidance after the bell Thursday: EPS totaled $6.02 on $2.53B in sales, whereas analysts were looking for $5.83 per share on $2.5B, while comparable-store sales climbed 8% - a slowdown from 14.4% the prior year. And the full-year profit forecast comes to $25.10 to $25.60 per share on $11.05B to $11.15B, with comps expected to rise 4.5% to 5.5%.Ulta shares were up 1.3% to $428.08 premarket Friday.Also up in Friday's premarket were Gap (NYSE:GPS) shares, which were recently climbing 1.4% to $9.66 after the casual-clothing retailer said Q2 adjusted earnings totaled $0.34 per share, $0.25 better than consensus, on a slightly lower-than-expected top line of $3.55B. Comparable store sales were down 6% over its brands, including Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta, and Q3 sales are seen down in the low double-digits range.Finally, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its full-year guidance Thursday and reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.81, crushing the $0.45 average Street target, on better-than-expected revenue of $3.77B. Still, sales suffered a 275-basis-point hit from its wind-down of Canadian operations, as well as a 12.9% fall in online sales due to elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders in the prior year and the closing down of Trunk Club.Nordstrom shares were ticking down fractionally to $16.75 in recent premarket trading Friday.(Yasin Ebrahim, Davit Kirakosyan, Liz Moyer, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.)Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Nvidia's bang-up Q2; retail's bottom-line beatsFactbox-Companies sell their businesses in RussiaAffirm surges amid growth in customer transaction volumes]"

The August washout appears to want to continue; there were no major news events that would reasonably expect the Dow to plummet -330 points, -0.96% — and it was the winner of the main indices. The S&amp;P 500 fell -1.36% on the day, and the Nasdaq, early today buoyed by NVIDIA’s NVDA big earnings performance yesterday after the close, sank -1.88% on the day. The small-cap Russell 2000 was down -1.27%.Basically, we’ve just kissed those big gains from June and July goodbye. This is obviously bad news for short-term stock traders, but ultimately might provide a silver lining for longer-term investors: those mid-July highs were getting pretty “nose-bleed,” and pulling back — as many analysts had been looking for — looks to be setting the table for a higher-volume late summer/early fall trading environment with room to move higher. Or so goes the hopeful side of things.We would be wise to wait for Fed Chair Jay Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium tomorrow, his first major address since the last FOMC meeting, which brought about its fourth-straight 25 basis-point (bps) hike to the highest Fed funds rate since 2001. How warm will he be to the idea of further rate hikes in the near-term? Powell is never preoccupied with satisfying the immediate wants of stock market participants, but if he feels the need to reassure that the current 5.25-5.50% ought to take care of inflation meaningfully over time, perhaps he’ll throw us all a bone in the final days of a tough trading month.Nordstrom JWN posted a strong Q2 earnings beat after today’s close: earnings of 84 cents per share surged ahead of the 45 cents expected (and beating the year-ago 81 cents per share, as well) on revenues of $3.77 billion topped the $3.67 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is the seventh straight earnings beat for the company, even though we see lower results for its flagship stores and Nordstrom Rack discount stores. Shares initially jumped but are now flat on the news, as the company did not raise guidance after such a boffo earnings surprise.Gap Stores GPS also reported Q2 results after the closing bell, with a giant beat on the bottom line — earnings of 34 cents per share versus expectations of 9 cents — augmented by a slight miss on the top: $3.55 billion in quarterly sales, as opposed to the $3.60 billion analysts were expecting. Comps fell -6% year over year, which was worse than the -4% expected, while its Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and flagship Gap stores all came in lower than year-ago numbers. Shares are -5% in late trading.Specialty retailer Ulta Beauty ULTA outpaced expectations on both top and bottom lines in its Q2 report this afternoon, with earnings of $6.02 per share nicely improving over the $5.87 anticipated and revenues of $2.53 billion in the quarter ahead of the $2.51 billion. The company also raised Q3 comps guidance, after seeing +8% gains year over year in today’s release. Interestingly, Ulta is one of the few major retailers having recently reported with positive Inventory growth of +9%; the company credited high demand for the gains in supply. Shares are up +2% in after-market trading.Questions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here&gt;&gt;Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company delivered an EPS surprise of +2.56%, with the consensus EPS estimate being $5.87.While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.As these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.Here is how Ulta performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Comparable store sales - YoY change: 8% versus 5.91% estimated by 10 analysts on average.Number of stores - Total: 1362 versus the eight-analyst average estimate of 1365.25.Total gross square footage: 14272.44 Msq ft compared to the 14373.67 Msq ft average estimate based on seven analysts.Number of stores opened - Total: 3 versus the six-analyst average estimate of 6.5.Stores at Beginning of the Period: 1359 versus the four-analyst average estimate of 1359.View all Key Company Metrics for Ulta here&gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Ulta have returned -3.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.1% change.

The company also saw a drop in comparable sales across all four brands. Nordstrom (JWN) shares are trading in the red despite beating expectations on adjusted earnings, revenue, and same-store sales in its second quarter. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares fall as the company's second quarter results barely beat estimates on adjusted earnings and revenue. Ulta (ULTA) shares are trading in the green after the company boosted its earnings and comp sales forecast for the year. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith takes a look at some of the stocks moving in after-hours trading.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at a couple of names that are trending after-hours. We've got four stocks for you. Let's start off with GAP. We're looking at gains of just about 7/10 of a percent, not a huge move here in extended trading. It's actually a bit surprising, given the results that we just got from GAP. The company reporting a larger-than-expected drop in same-store sales. Revenue also missing expectations. Total comp sales declining 6%, which was worse than expected. All four brands for the company posting a decline in same-store sales from a year ago.They have the new CEO, Richard Dickson. He is going to be on the call this afternoon, certainly has a tough time-- a tough couple of months ahead as he looks to right the retailer. But shares of GAP, again, moving-- let's take a look at GAP, not Dow. Shares of GAP up just about 25% over the last three months. Year-to-date, though, we're still looking at declines of about 15%.Moving on to Nordstrom, another reading here on the retail sector. Better-than-expected earnings, revenue, and same-store sales, yet we're still seeing declines when we take a look at some of the numbers that we're getting. Rack was one of the bright spots, I guess, you could call it that, in this report. The decline in sales wasn't as bad as what the Street was anticipating. Rack posting a sales drop of just about 4.1% for the quarter. That's an improvement from an 11% drop the previous quarter.Story continuesYear-to-date, Nordstrom barely in the green, up just about 4%. When you take a look at the movement over the last three months, pretty similar here on that performance. Lots of questions about what the future looks like for Nordstrom and where the company should focus as it tries to get more consumers through its stores.And Marvell Technology, another read on AI and the excitement that we're seeing there. Certainly, a lot was riding on this report. We're looking at losses of just about 3%. Now, the company's adjusted EPS beat the Street's expectations. Net revenue also topped what the Street was looking for at $134 billion. But it was a decline of about 12% year-over-year. Data set and revenue was off 29% year-over-year. There's certainly been a lot of growing optimism within Marvell because of their AI exposure. Year-to-date, we're looking at gains of just about 54%.And rounding it out with Ulta, another reading on the consumer. Year-to-date drop of nearly 10%. After-hours, though, we're looking at a gain of just about 2%. The company boosting its earnings forecast for the year as well as its comp sales forecast. They're expecting growth of 4 and 1/2% to 5 and 1/2%. So consumers are still spending a bit when it comes to beauty. Year-to-date, though, like I said, shares are still in the red.]"

This compares to earnings of $5.70 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this beauty products retailer would post earnings of $6.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.88, delivering a surprise of 0.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Ulta , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, posted revenues of $2.53 billion for the quarter ended July 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.87%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.3 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Ulta shares have lost about 6.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 15.5%.What's Next for Ulta?While Ulta has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ulta: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

To expand its 787 Dreamliner family jet, Qantas is looking to add four more 787-9 and eight 787-10 airplanes to its already existing portfolio of 14 787-9 jets.Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner family of jets can fly with sustainable aviation fuel, and eco-friendly GE engines will assist Qantas in taking a step forward in its sustainability goals and reducing emissions by up to 25%. These jets are capable of flying a longer distance non-stop and provide Qantas with the benefits of adding new routes to its network and using less fuel.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing’s latest Commercial Market Outlook projects the demand for 42,000 new commercial airplanes for the next 20 years. The report further suggests passenger traffic to continue to show strength. This reflects bright growth prospects for commercial aerospace players like Boeing.It remains the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. The strong demand for its commercial planes can be gauged by revenues in the Commercial segment, which increased 41% year over year, mainly driven by higher 787 deliveries.Boeing delivered 136 commercial planes during the last reported quarter, thus recording growth of 12% year over year. The backlog for its Commercial segment remained healthy, with more than 4,800 airplanes valued at $363 billion.Such an impressive order backlog assures strength in the performance of the top line of the company, thus boosting its overall returns.Peer ProspectsApart from Boeing, aircraft manufacturers in the industry that have an established position in the aircraft manufacturing market and may gain from the flourishing demand are as follows:Airbus EADSY enjoys strong demand in the commercial aircraft segment. EADSY delivered 189 commercial aircraft in the second quarter, thus registering growth of 21.9% year over year.EADSY expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2023.Story continuesThe long-term (three to five years) earnings growth of EADSY stands at 12.4%.

Shares have lost about 4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Waste Management due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Waste Management Misses Q2 Earnings EstimatesWaste Management Inc. reported disappointing second-quarter 2023 results, wherein both earnings and revenues failed to surpass the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings per share of $1.51 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%, and improved 4.9% year over year. Total revenues of $5.11 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%, and increased 1.8% year over year.Quarterly Numbers in DetailThe Collection segment recorded revenues of $3.45 billion, up 4.4% from the prior-year quarter’s figure but missed our estimate of $3.51 billion. The Landfill segment’s top line grew 5.9% year over year to $1.27 billion beating our estimate of $1.22 billion. Total revenues in the Transfer segment were up 5.6% to $585 million in comparison to our expectation of $572.2 million.The Recycling segment’s revenues dropped 20.9% to $370 million missed our estimate of $417.9 million. Other businesses’ revenues totaled $653 million, up 9.6% year over year.Adjusted operating EBITDA of $1.47 billion increased 3.5% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Adjusted operating EBITDA margin fell 60 basis points to 28.7% from the prior-year quarter.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sasan.Story continuesSasan K. GoodarziAll right. Excellent. Kim, thank you, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We had a very strong fourth quarter as we executed on our strategy to be the global AI-driven expert platform, powering prosperity for consumers and small businesses. We grew full year revenue 13%, delivered strong operating margin expansion and exited the year with momentum. Our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our platform and diversity of our portfolio, including our ability to maintain earnings power in uncertain times. This past year, we expanded our operating margin again while investing in the most important areas to drive durable long-term growth. We're guiding to another year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion in fiscal year 2024, even with a macroeconomic environment that is uncertain. We're entering Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago, we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our 5 Big Bets. We've made strong progress transforming from a tax and accounting platform where consumers and small businesses have to do the work to achieve the benefit that they are seeking to a global financial platform where we do the hard work for them. Now we're creating a future of done for you, a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers to fuel their financial success. This future is only possible because of our history of significant investments in our platform, talent, data and AI and now our accelerated investments in generative AI. At the core of our platform is powerful, relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal, transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. For small businesses, we have a 360-degree view of their business and customers. We have 500,000 customer and financial attributes per small business on our platform, and this data gives us insights into behaviors, income stream, expenses, profitability and cash flows, enabling us to provide personalized experiences and recommendations to help them prosper. Additionally, we have 60,000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform, including income, expenses, credit history, spending history, outstanding loans, cash flow and tax information, which enables us to become a financial assistant in their pocket. We are using our data to fine-tune our own financial large language models that specialize in solving tax, accounting, cash flow, marketing and personal finance challenges. The investments that we've made in data and AI over the years allow us to introduce innovation at an accelerated rate. Intuit's rich data platform is a powerful foundation that allows us to create innovative AI-assisted experiences for all of our customers powering their prosperity. In June, we introduced our generative AI operating system called GenOS to ignite innovation at scale for the benefit of millions of consumers and small businesses. GenOS empowers Intuit's technologists to create breakthrough generative AI experiences. We are using a platform approach, giving our teams across Intuit the resources and the tools they need to design, build, test and deploy these new experiences with unparalleled speed. This includes our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers in a cost-effective way. We are entering Intuit's most exciting era yet and believe the next several years will be game changing. On September 6, we'll be hosting Intuit's Innovation Day, a virtual event where we will unveil exciting GenAI innovation across our platform and how it will drive business growth in the years ahead. We look forward to sharing more with you then. Now let me turn to our Big Bets, which are driving growth and benefits for our customers today. I'd like to highlight some examples of recent progress in one of our Big Bets. And as a reminder, our 5 Big Bets are: revolutionize speed to benefit, connect people to experts, unlock smart money decisions, be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market. Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers, get paid fast, manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments, our innovation continues to drive digitization, from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer, to getting paid. Today, easy discovery auto-enabled payments, instant deposits and getting paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering, leading to 22% total online payment volume growth this quarter. We're making significant progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We see tremendous opportunity of 80% of businesses still pay other firms via paper checks. We recently expanded the availability of the beta of our native bill pay solution by 10x. Turning to Mailchimp. We're well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. We have 3 acceleration priorities with Mailchimp: first, delivering on our vision of an end-to-end QuickBooks and Mailchimp customer growth platform; second, disrupting the mid-market by developing a full marketing automation, CRM and e-commerce suite; and third, accelerating global growth with a holistic go-to-market approach. This last quarter, we implemented our first generative AI capability in Mailchimp, the Email Content Generator, enabling customers to create faster email campaign based on industry, marketing intent and brand voice. This quarter, we launched the beta of new product, announcement generator, which uses AI to automatically create an email that a small business can send to their customers. We also announced over 150 new and updated features in recent Mailchimp conference in London designed to support the needs of advanced marketers, including a calendar view, custom reporting and analytics, more e-commerce advanced segmentation, more real-time behavioral data based on e-commerce automation and SMS marketing. Lineup changes and free trials are driving positive trends in year-over-year paid customer growth, which accelerated this quarter. We continue to make progress in mid-market. Our 90-day retention rate this quarter is the highest it's been in 2 years. We've also translated the product into 5 different languages. We'll share more on the outcomes we're delivering across our 5 Big Bets at our Investor Day. Wrapping up, with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our products, we're moving at a high velocity. This will help us with more money in our customers' pockets, save them time and ensure complete confidence in every financial decision they make. As we lead this next technological shift, we are well positioned to power prosperity for our customers and communities that we serve with the leadership team that is built for the era of AI. Now let me turn it over to Sandeep. It's great to have you on the call, my friend.Sandeep Singh AujlaThank you, Sasan. I'm excited to be here, and I look forward to meeting many of you in the future. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2023, including total revenue growth of 13%, strong margin expansion and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of 16% and 22%, respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we delivered results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics, including revenue of $2.7 billion, up 12%; GAAP operating income of $17 million versus a loss of $75 million last year; non-GAAP operating income of $627 million versus $433 million last year, up 45%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32 versus a loss of $0.20 a year ago; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.65 versus $1.10 last year, up 50%. Now turning to the business segments. In the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 24% for the full year, which included 4 points of benefit from the full year of Mailchimp's revenue this year versus 3 quarters last year. Online Ecosystem revenue grew 21% during the quarter and 30% for the full year. With the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses, our strategic focus within the Small Business and Self-Employed Group is threefold: growth at core, connected ecosystem and expand globally. First, we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online accounting revenue grew 22% in Q4 and 26% in fiscal '23. Growth for the quarter and fiscal year were driven mainly by customer growth, higher effective prices and mix shift. Second, we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services grew 20% in Q4, driven by payroll, Mailchimp, payments, capital and time tracking. For the full fiscal year '23, QuickBooks Online Services grew 34%, driven by Mailchimp, payroll, payments, capital and time tracking. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting our payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. Mailchimp revenue grew mid-teens in Q4. Growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth. Within payments, revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offering to manage their cash flows as well as an increase in total payment volume for our customers. Third, we continue to make progress expanding globally. By executing our refreshed international strategy, which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in our established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on localized product and lineup. On a constant currency basis, total international Online Ecosystem revenue grew 12% in Q4 and 31% in fiscal '23. The power of our Small Business platform continues to resonate with customers as they look to grow their business and improve cash flow across all types of economic environments. Our platform remains critical to our customer success, and we continue to see them adopt multiple offerings across the platform to manage their business. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 19% in the fourth quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the low 20s. We have approximately 2/3 of the way through a 3-year transition for customers that remain on a license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model. We also raised our desktop prices across multiple products last September, consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong Desktop Ecosystem revenue growth next year as we complete the remaining part of the 3-year transition. Our focus is to continue building out our Online Ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the Online Ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Small Business and Self-Employed revenue growth of 15% to 20% per year long term. Now shifting to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $424 million in Q4, down 11%. On a product basis, the decline in Q4 was driven primarily by macroeconomic headwinds in personal loans, auto insurance, home loans and auto loans, partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma Money. Full year revenue was $1.6 billion, down 9%. Credit Karma represented 11% of Intuit's total revenue in fiscal '23. We have seen continued stability across our core verticals, which led to the improvement in year-over-year performance during Q4 versus Q3. For context, credit cards and personal loans represented nearly 60% and nearly 30% of Credit Karma's revenue in fiscal '23, respectively. Looking ahead, we continue to anticipate Credit Karma annual revenue growth of 20% to 25% per year long term. Now shifting to Consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $4.1 billion in fiscal '23, up 6%. Each tax season has been unique since the pandemic began 4 years ago, introducing volatility into consumer group results. However, average annual plans over this 4-year period are more in line with the long-term trend. Over the past 4 years, Consumer Group revenue increased by an average of 10% annually, which aligns with our long-term growth expectations of 8% to 12%. While this was a unique tax season, I am proud of the progress the team made with transforming the assisted segment with TurboTax Live, which grew revenue 17% this year, while customers grew 12%. Looking ahead, we are confident in multiple growth drivers. First, we see large runway ahead of us with TurboTax Live, given our ability to use both GenAI and human experts covered by AI to deliver confidence for our customers. We are investing in scaling our full-service offering, which has good product market fit based on the highest product recommendation scores of any product at Intuit this year. Second, we are planning to scale our business tax offering following a successful pilot this year. And third, we see significant opportunities ahead, driving Credit Karma members to TurboTax and giving TurboTax filers faster access to their money with Credit Karma Money. Given the growth opportunities I just shared, we continue to expect annual Consumer Group revenue growth of 8% to 12% per year over the long term. Turning to the ProTax Group. Revenue was $561 million in fiscal '23, up 3%. Now let me share more on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions, remains our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.7 billion in cash and investments and $6.1 billion in debt on our balance sheet. Approximately $4.2 billion of this debt is maturing over the next 15 months, and we are evaluating refinancing opportunities subject to market and other conditions. We repurchased $465 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2 billion during fiscal '23. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on October 17, 2023. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. We recently finalized our 3- and 1-year strategic plan. I feel confident in the investments we are making to drive durable growth, including executing across our Big Bets and continuing the accelerated pace of innovation, particularly with GenAI. We have a proven playbook for operating in both good and difficult economic times. We manage for the short and the long term and control discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in a position of strength. Moving on to guidance. Our fiscal 2024 guidance includes total company revenue of $15.89 billion to $ 16.105 billion, a growth of 11% to 12%. Our guidance includes revenue growth of 16% to 17% for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group, 7% to 8% for the Consumer Group and a decline of 3% to a growth of 3% for Credit Karma. GAAP earnings per share of $9.37 to $9.67, growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $16.17 to $16.47, growth of 12% to 14%. We expect GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2024. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal '24 includes revenue growth of 10% to 11%, GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.21 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 to $2. We are taking a prudent approach with guidance, given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal '24, we expect to pay approximately $700 million in cash debt payments related to fiscal '23, which were deferred due to the IRS disaster area tax relief. You can find a full fiscal 2024 and Q1 guidance details in our press release as well as on a fact sheet. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Sasan.Sasan K. GoodarziGreat. Thank you. Well, in wrapping up, we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress with our 5 Big Bets, the investments that we're making in GenAI and our leadership team driving our platform innovation. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. In today's uncertain macro environment, the benefits of our global financial technology platform are more important and mission-critical than ever to our customers. I look forward to your attendance at our Intuit Innovation Day on September 6 and Investor Day on September 28. With that, let's open it up to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And we'll take our first question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.Keith WeissReally nice quarter and nice to see a forward EPS guide ahead of kind of where consensus was to see those numbers start moving up. My inbox though is getting filled up with questions about the Consumer business and the Consumer guide. You've talked about a longer-term 8% to 12% growth there, the 4-year CAGR of 10%. But this year, you're looking for 7% to 8%, so below that guidance framework. And I think what people are trying to understand is why that is. Last year was a difficult tax season. Did you pull the levers too hard on pricing? Or was it -- do we need to refill the tank in terms of units? Like what is it that's going to keep this tax season to be underperforming those longer-term targets?Sasan K. GoodarziThank you for your question. Let me give you the headlines, but allow me to unpack it. I think the headline is we're just simply being prudent. Our focus on future growth and our bullishness does not change at all. Let me unpack that. First and foremost, when you look at the assisted segment, there's a $30 billion TAM and $20 billion of it is consumer-assisted segment and $10 billion of it is business segment. And the second is the secular shift towards digitization will continue and only accelerate in the years to come. And with that as context, we probably saw some of our biggest green shoots this year, which is why we're probably more bullish about what's possible in this business than we were even 3 to 4 years ago. And I would put it in 2 buckets, Credit Karma and then the assisted segment. In Credit Karma, just as a reminder, our vision from the moment that we bought Credit Karma was to create one consumer platform where a consumer could manage their financial life, manage their money and get their taxes done in one place. After several years of just rapid experimentation, we had a massive breakthrough this past year where our customer growth within the Credit Karma platform, this is a number of Credit Karma members that became TurboTax customers was up 5x. And we are scaling that both on the product side and on the business model side. That gives us a lot of confidence going into next year and beyond. The second is in the assisted segment, and it's in 3 parts. First and foremost is we actually had product market fit this past year in full service. Our biggest focus was how do we scale? We had some breakthroughs in how to scale. In fact, as you heard from Sandeep, it had our best product recommendation score with any product across the company, and we are significantly leaning into that in the coming year. The second is business tax. We launched and learned to get the product market fit. In business tax, that is not going to be available, both across our QuickBooks Live platform and directly going to market with TurboTax. And we have hundreds of thousands if not millions of people have come to TurboTax looking for business tax, we've never had an offering. We will next year, and we are scaling it. The last thing I would say in the assisted segment, one of the biggest things that we've learned in this last year is local matters. What that means is people will go on Google and they will search. If I'm in San Diego, who's very [pro], close to me. Well, we've never been good at being found in local. And in fact, when you look at the experts that we have, we are 10 miles from every home in the households in the United States. And so we're going big on local this year. And so when I look at our green shoots in the assisted segment and Credit Karma, it gives us a lot of confidence as we look at this coming year and the future. And I'll end with where I started, which was the essence of your question about our guidance, we're simply being prudent given the year that we just had.OperatorAnd we'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.Sitikantha PanigrahiGreat quarter. And Sandeep, congratulations on your first earnings call, and looking forward to working with you. Sasan, I want to ask about your bill pay. What sort of feedback have you been getting from your beta customer from the QuickBooks netted bill pay? And how should we think about the near-term opportunity as you're switching the legacy powered by payment solution with now your native bill pay? And then on the broader vision side on Small Business, now that you have full end-to-end cash flow management, now you have AR invoice payment and AP bill pay, then you have money, bank accounts. So what is your broader vision in terms of that, monetizing the whole ecosystem?Sasan K. GoodarziYes, Siti, thank you for your question. Let me take it in 2 parts. First and foremost, you've heard us in the past year plus talk about digitizing B2B with respect to all of the manual work that gets done today in terms of 80% of the back and forth between small businesses is all sort of paper checks and manual. And our goal has been to digitize all of that. And one last element of what we needed to do was to launch bill pay. I think the headline I would just give is the feedback we've been getting has even gone better than what we thought, and we're now at a place where we are 10x-ing our beta, and we hope to have it available to all of our customers soon. So we feel very good about what we are seeing in bill pay and how fast we're able to build it based on the platform capabilities that we have and the feedback that we've gotten from customers. I think back to your second question, you're right. And in fact, the vision I would take you back to is that we have set out to be the source of truth for a business and to truly be the center of small business growth. And in order to do that, we have to have capabilities that not only help a small business grow their customers, retain their customers, market to their customers, but to be able to manage their cash flow and be able to manage their employees. We now have all of those capabilities end-to-end. And I think particularly, what's important, that advantages us to deliver for our customers is the data and our AI investments that we've made in the last 5-plus years. And I think I would just encourage you to attend, and if you can attend when it's on real time, watch the replay of our September 6 Intuit Innovation Day. And you will see how with our data, AI and GenAI capabilities, we help customers manage their cash flow and really digitize all of money movement in a way that's so intuitive, so easy and delivered at a moment of truth. So we're quite excited about what's possible as we look at this coming year, but the years ahead. And let me, by the way, be very explicit that none of our potential innovation that you're going to experience in September 6 around GenAI is included in our guidance. But we believe it is fundamentally revolutionary as we think about the world we're going to create in the future.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.Brent John ThillSasan, when you mentioned prudent in the tax guide, I'm curious, are you baking in more wiggle room this year than in past years in the guidance? Or can you just walk through what you mean by prudent?Sasan K. GoodarziSure. Great question. Well, first of all, I'll just take you back to what you already know, but I think it's important that we start there. This past year, IRS returns, we continue to estimate will be down a couple of points. The do-it-yourself category will be down nearly 1 point. And the driver of that, which we are now certain of, based on all the working analysis that we've done, is we had a number of folks that came in to get their stimulus dollars and tax credits, and so it was pandemic driven. And so that created just what you heard from Sandeep, it's sort of a very unusual tax season. But then when you step back and look at the last 4-year trend, it sort of straightened out. And so what we mean by prudent is really a couple of things: one, we're not assuming IRS growth in our numbers this year, and we're not banking on all of the innovation that I just shared paying off this coming year. And that's just part of us being prudent because we want to demonstrate to all of you that this is a business that grows 8% to 12%. And by doing so, we must deliver the results. And so it's just being very intentional and very prudent. As we think about, by the way, our guidance holistically, it's not just TurboTax, it's TurboTax, it's Credit Karma and the way we thought about Small Business. But those are -- that's the sort of the definition of what we mean by prudent.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.Michael James TurrinOkay. Great. You delivered outsized margin expansion this past year. You've mentioned a focus on cost controls given the tougher environment throughout the year, realized it's one of the guiding principles. But maybe, Sandeep, if you can just speak to what's allowing you to guide for continued margin expansion as a starting point here. And maybe how we should think about what's allowing for continued margin expansion as you break into the upper 30s there on the operating margin side.Sandeep Singh AujlaThanks for the question, Michael. And let me unpack it a little bit. We go through a 3-, 4-year planning process, as I shared in the prepared remarks and do that process if you look at one of the biggest needle movers to deliver growth both in the near term and the long term, so durable growth levers for the company. And we make sure those are funded for success, inclusive of Big Bets and investments in GenAI. So the 40 to 60 bps of guidance reflects those investments and, quite frankly, reflects the strength and resilience of our platform. As a reminder, this is an expansion we're delivering on top of the 3.5 points of expansion we delivered over the last 3 years. As I look ahead, I see plenty of runway for us to continue to operate in accordance with our financial principles to grow expenses slower than revenue therefore, implying a margin expansion. And really, as I look at it, what gives me confidence is that we are an AI-driven expert platform, and we operate as an ecosystem across technology, across customer success, across marketing. So in addition to giving us a competitive advantage for having faster time to market from [opting] as an ecosystem, it also gives us advantage in getting operating leverage as we scale as a business.OperatorOur next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS.Taylor Anne McGinnisMaybe I'll focus on the Small Business and Self-Employed full year guide, which was really strong. So I know there's a bunch of moving pieces in there between customer ads, mix shift, online services attach and price. But are you able to help us understand how each of those levers are contributing to the guide? And based on what you're seeing in the environment, what's giving you comfort and the durability of those growth drivers?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thank you for your question. Let me start us off and Sandeep, please jump in if you want to add anything. First of all, we have a framework at the company level where we want to drive the majority of our growth from volume and mix and the lesser part from price, but we always focus on pricing for value. And so when we look at our growth drivers this year, it is coming from customer growth, and it is coming from mix and to a lesser extent this year compared to last year, by the way, from price. With that as context, I would just remind you that the big picture, when you look at our opportunity this coming year, but even in the next 3 to 5 years plus, we now have a platform and a portfolio of services where we have the opportunity to drive further adoption of our services from Mailchimp to payments, to payroll to time tracking and to a lot of our new innovations around bill pay and digitizing B2B that I just mentioned. But also, although we are 3 to 4 years in, we're just at the beginning of what's possible in the mid-market. Mid-market is a significant ARPC opportunity because these customers use a lot of the capabilities that I just mentioned, except they pay a lot more. And we're just at the beginning of the flywheel of penetrating mid-market. So when you look at the portfolio of the services that we have, the strength of the experience that we're delivering because of data and AI and because of mid-market, it allows us to drive most of our growth from customer growth and mix. And none of that, by the way, takes into account what's possible as we look into the future with our generative AI experiences that you'll be able to observe on September 6. But those are the main drivers.Sandeep Singh AujlaAnd Taylor, I would add to that. Over the long term, we remain committed to our growth algorithm of 10% to 20% ARPC and customer growth. That remains unchanged. And really, as Sasan mentioned, is our innovation across our platform that gives us -- opens up the apps here for us to cross-sell and upsell our customers across more offerings on our platform as well as opportunity for us to price for value as we look ahead.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganSo the recession that everybody's been expecting, it doesn't seem to be quite happening. Sasan, I know you've got a great read on your SMB ecosystem. What are some of the indicators that you're seeing? And if you've already proactively addressed this, my apologies for bringing it up again. But what are some of the forward-looking indicators that you see in the Credit Karma business or the SMB ecosystem that give you renewed confidence that we are going to be okay? Because your fiscal '24 guidance definitely is not reflecting of any caution in the environment, but more like a continuation of what we've seen in the last 4 quarters. Just some thoughts there would be great.Sasan K. GoodarziYes, sure. Thank you for your question. And you're loud and clear, my friend. So let me start with Small Business. And generally, I would just lead with they continue to be healthy, but they're challenged in this environment. The specifics that I would share is the cash flow and cash reserves of small businesses is 90% of what it was this time last year. However, it is still stronger than pre-pandemic. The -- in terms of looking for labor and finding employees to drive their growth, that's still quite strong. And in fact, in this environment, small businesses are able to do a better job finding what they need versus when the market was hot, which is good for them because then they can deliver for their customers and drive growth. And the last thing I would just say is there are certain sectors that are very weak, transportation, real estate, advertising, is very weak within small businesses. So that's the aggregate picture. I'll end with where I started, struggling but still healthy compared to pre-pandemic. On the consumer side, let me hit on sort of 2 different points. I'll quickly hit on Credit Karma. As you have -- as Sandeep mentioned, what we're seeing is stability and our innovation that we've been focused on is really getting hold, and there's some exciting things that we're working on in Credit Karma that we'll share both on September 6 and at Investor Day, one where we redesigned the entire app. And we have begun to roll it out to a small cohort of customers and will eventually scale it. And we're actually seeing very good engagement with the redesigned app. And then that, coupled with our GenAI experiences, along with all of our innovation with Lightbox and Credit Karma Money gives us a lot of excitement around the future, none of which, by the way, is in our guidance. But the headline is stability in Credit Karma and lots of innovation that is helping us with where we are and coming. If I just focus on the consumer, a couple of things I would say. If you look back to last March of 2022, credit scores are, on average, down 13 points. Credit balances are up about 30%. And the credit band of like 600 to 660 have the largest balances. They're carrying about $10,000 on average. And the Gen Z balances have gone up the most, they're up 45% year-over-year. So job market is still good. People still have jobs, but there's certainly some level of strain on the consumer.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.Brad Robert RebackGreat. Sasan, following up on that Credit Karma commentary. Obviously, the world we live in today is different than when you acquired the business. Do you think the long-term growth rate of Credit Karma is meaningfully different in a world where interest rates are mid-single digits versus 0?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Brad, thank you for your question. The short answer is no. We're very bullish on the business. And in fact, a couple of things that I would share with you, which we can talk more about at Investor Day, but just not to leave you hanging, the monetization model in Credit Karma is how many members we have, how frequently they engage. And there's a model for every time a customer engages, there is a average revenue per customer that we benefit from. And in fact, this past year, in '23, when our results were down year-over-year, our frequency of engagement is actually higher than the prior 2 years where we had 37% growth and 58% growth. Now why is that? It's because of all of our innovation. It's because the customer is engaging but in many areas, credit is still tight. So when credit begins to open up, and that's the stability that we're seeing now, we view this business will accelerate back to the 20% to 25% growth rate. Plus I'll remind you that, that plus the integration with TurboTax drives actually more stickiness, more monetization and truly creates this one consumer platform, which was our vision from day 1 when we acquired Credit Karma. And with all of the data and AI capabilities that we have in our accelerated GenAI experiences, as I said earlier, you're going to see on September 6 some of the new innovations that are coming that will make it easier for customers to find what they need, the benefits that they need to engage in the financial products that they want and manage their money. And so all of that leads to our view is completely unchanged relative to the long-term expectations of 20% to 25% growth in Credit Karma.Sandeep Singh AujlaAnd Brad, the one thing I would add to this because you asked about a scenario in which interest rates are higher. When interest rates are higher, the consumer have a higher propensity to shop around, because even a small improvement in the rates that they're getting has a bigger difference in terms of the interest rate they're paying and a bigger difference to their bottom line. So in fact, the product becomes more important, critical to the end user in a higher rate environment.OperatorOur next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.Kartik MehtaThis year, you're really focused, at least from a TV advertising standpoint on full service, really trying to get the message out. And I'm wondering, one of the things you talked about is being a little bit more prudent on revenue growth on the consumer business. I'm wondering, are you -- will your strategy change at all in how you're marketing the full-service product? And how did the full-service product performed compared to your expectations this quarter as well -- this year as well?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Great question. Let me give you an answer that I think you'll find somewhat helpful and somewhat vague intentionally. We learned a lot this year. We came into the year with a full-service offering that has product markets that as you know, it's all AI driven. And we can virtually get things done within an hour or same day. We learned a lot around health and scaling and how to have customers find our full-service offering. And a lot of it also has to do with what I mentioned earlier, which is local marketing. If I'm in San Diego, if I'm in Kansas City, even if I see that TurboTax can provide experts, I go to start to see locally if there's somebody there. Well, all of our experts that we have are within 10 miles of many of the households in the United States, but we've never marketed that way. And so that's going to inform our marketing going forward. So there's a lot that we learned in terms of how to evolve our marketing so it becomes an and, and not an either/or, and we're excited about it.OperatorOur next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.Kirk MaterneSasan, I'd love to hear you just give a little bit more detail on what you're counting on Mailchimp to do this year and maybe not if you don't want to get too much into the quantitative side. Qualitatively, you guys have done a lot of work around the product, the monetization. How important is sort of a continued acceleration of Mailchimp as you look at sort of the small business in aggregate for next year?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Kirk, thank you for your question. It's really -- to answer your question, it's really threefold. First and foremost, as you know, we made this acquisition ultimately to create one growth platform, so we can help a small business in one place, be able to grow their business and manage their cash flow and manage their workforce all in one place. And really the key to all of this has been data, AI and now our accelerated investments in GenAI. And so first and foremost is we want to make significant progress in this area, and you'll actually see some of this on both September 6, our Intuit Innovation Day and at Investor Day. That's number one. The second is, as I mentioned earlier, we had the largest release in June that we've ever had in Mailchimp's history. We had 150 new and updated features that we released on top of multiple GenAI-driven announcements that we had made a couple of weeks prior to that. So our second focus is adoption, getting our customers to adopt these benefits because not only will it help fuel their success, but it will help us with monetization, particularly in the mid-market, which is where our focus is very similar to the focus that we've had with QuickBooks' mid-market. And then third is international. Mailchimp is the lead horse internationally. And we've done a lot to localize the product. I mentioned earlier the 5 languages and more is coming. We've also been doing a lot of price studies and price testing because we've had like one class price internationally that doesn't work. Some countries should be higher, some countries should be lower. And so we've learned a lot in terms of some of our testing and many of that we're going to be scaling this year. So those are -- if I were to just sort of carve out your question, those are the 3 big areas that we are very focused on in the coming year.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.Nicholas Paul GiovacchiniIt's Nick Giovacchini on for Brad this evening. Congratulations on the strong end to the year, and welcome, Sandeep. International growth has decelerated since the beginning of the year. Can you talk us through how you see that growing going forward?Sandeep Singh AujlaThanks for the question, Nick. A couple of things on the international growth. On international growth, as I shared earlier, our focus, our refreshed strategy is to lead with both Mailchimp and QuickBooks in the markets where we have product market fit. And in other areas to lead with Mailchimp at the tip of the spear. Our growth decelerated for a couple of reasons, and some of that Sasan shared as we lead into rightsizing the pricing for Mailchimp in some of these geographies. Historically, it was the same price. It was basically the price set in the U.S. simply converting into the local currency and applied in that geography. We went in and we looked at what the price should be based on the competitors in the market, based on the GDP per capita and all these other factors and we rightsized the price. Secondly, as we do in QuickBooks, we introduced free trials or discounts initially when folks joined the product is what we have experienced over our years of doing that is people -- more people coming to the product and they stick around and that leads to a better 90-day forward retention, et cetera. So these are all the factors and all the improvements we're making in the Mailchimp product and the lineup, which is leading to what I would describe as a temporary headwind in terms of our international growth.OperatorOur next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.Aleksandr J. ZukinCongrats on a really nice and prudent guidance methodology for next year. I guess maybe I'll just -- I want both of my questions to really target the SMB growth rate. It seems like the guide there ex Mailchimp is really strong. Sandeep, you're now in the CFO seat. Maybe just talk about -- you talked about the prudence intact, but the prudence in the SMB guide, what gives you guys the confidence to kind of guide that way? How much of it has to do with some of the payment functionalities that are coming to market, some of the GenAI functionality that's coming to market, what gives you guys that guidance? And then dovetailing into that, new leadership for that group, obviously, as well. Is there talk about the potential for either disruption or how is that accounted for? Or why Marianna was the right fit for that role specifically and kind of where -- what she's going to bring to the table?Sasan K. GoodarziAlex, can I take the leadership question and take it more broadly and then let Sandeep jump in and answer specifically your question around the guide? Let me take this opportunity to talk about the leadership changes that we've had in the company. And I'll, of course, include Marianna in that as well. First of all, one of our greatest superpowers as a company is leadership development and succession planning. One of the focus areas that we have as part of our Intuit operating system, which starts at the top with my staff is we spend 4 times a year, several days at a time, focusing on talent, focusing on succession planning, reviewing development plans and being very intentional about architecting mobility moves. And ultimately, our goal is to be pretty deep in all of our key roles at multiple levels in the company, which, by the way, is very hard to do. But that is why we are a leadership factory. The second thing I would say is that we are very focused on mobility of senior roles, so the Vice President and above, which is an officer of the company and above, typically within a 3- to 5-year period, there's a lot of it you don't have visibility to, of course, because you only see potential changes that happened in my staff. But we're very intentional about mobility because we believe fresh perspective, fresh thinking is important in our technology areas and our businesses and also training the leaders to be ready for a bigger job is very important. By the way, I'll use myself as an example. Before I stepped into the CEO job 4.5 years ago, I was in TurboTax for 3 years. I was in QuickBooks -- running Small Business for 3 years and I was the CIO for 2 years. So that's just an example of mobility. With all of that said, sometimes our mobility is up and to the right and changes within the company. Sometimes, we celebrate folks taking on roles outside of the company because that may be the best fit for them. So with that as context, we have a lot of confidence in our leaders, and let me now specifically touch on our 3 of the leaders just to make it very real. When you look at Marianna, I actually hired Marianna into Small Business when I was there. She was our Chief Product Development Officer and is very familiar with Small Business. When I became the CEO, I moved her into the CEO role, and she's done an unbelievable job fueling innovation across the company. And now she's going back home to where she started, running Small Business. And very excited about what she will do to unlock the next year of growth. When you look at Mark in TurboTax, I actually started with Mark in TurboTax a decade ago and worked with him for 3 years. We then -- after I left TurboTax a few years later, promoted him to be our Chief Customer Success Officer of the company. And he is the godfather of our Live platform that we talk a lot about today. And now he's going back home and running TurboTax. So he's very well versed not only in the business, but our disruptive growth driver of the future, which is Live. And then Alex Balazs has just moved on our CTO role. I also worked with him in TurboTax. We then moved him to a broader Chief Architect and data role, where he's been Marianna's right-hand person, fielding the innovation across the company. We just moved him into the CTO role. The reason I wanted to go through that a bit fairly is for all of you to understand that succession planning and leadership development is our sort of core competency. And I actually believe that we have the strongest team that we've had ever built for the era of AI given their backgrounds and experiences. So with that as context, let me have Sandeep answer the other part of your question, Alex.Sandeep Singh AujlaAbsolutely. And actually, let me touch on one additional point to what Sasan added, it's never about one individual. We are a system, and we have strong leadership teams around our General Manager and CFO staff as well. So getting back to your question on the guidance, Alex. So just for context, the Small Business group grew 24% in fiscal '23, with 4 of those points coming from the benefit of the timing of the Mailchimp acquisition. So that's about a 20% organic run rate. And as we have shared with you with -- the group in the past is 80% of the revenues in the Small Business group are subscription-based. So that makes -- so the recurring nature of the revenue makes it highly predictable. And we -- this year saw strong results in areas where we are focused, such as QuickBooks Advanced customer growth as well as in the mid-market area that Sasan touched on. So that is one component of us giving us confidence as we guide for next year. The second aspect is the importance of our products to SMBs. This is something core to how they run their business, how they pay their employees, how they get paid themselves, how they get access to capital to take on new projects and grow their business. And we have made tremendous improvements in our product in an ecosystem that makes that platform that much more relevant and important to the lives of our customers. So that is what's all baked into the guidance that we provided for the Small Business and Self-Employed Group. You asked a question if we were relying on GenAI. I want to reiterate and be very clear. GenAI, we believe it will be an accelerator for our business, but that is not baked into the guidance that we shared with you all today.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.Arti VulaThis is Arti on for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to dig in on Credit Karma, specifically as it relates to the opportunity to begin to pursue prime customers in addition to the subprime and near-prime customers you guys have kind of focused on historically.Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thank you for your question. Yes, it's a big focus area for us going after prime customers. And just for context, it's sort of 1/3 of our monthly active users, and they're the least engaged because really, when you look at the platform, we traditionally focus on subprime and near prime. And we have a lot of the capabilities that we've developed in the past and know these prime customers very well, which is why we have merged our Mint and Credit Karma team and platform to really solve for these prime customers. And so we have been working, I think, for the last almost a year, really understanding their needs, running a number of experiments and are now -- and has been in the midst of launching multiple things that are very geared towards prime customers. And we're actually very excited with the app redesign. There's sort of 2 big things that we've been working on in Credit Karma beyond what we've been sharing with you. One is really redesigning the whole app to enable customers and certain cohort of customers like prime to be able to find the benefit that they're looking for because of everything that we know about them proactively. The second is the GenAI experience is that, again, we will unveil more of September 6. And the combination of those 2 things and what I shared a moment ago around prime customers gives us a lot of sort of excitement around what's possible to serve these prime customers going forward, which is something that we've not benefited from, from a monetization perspective. None of that is included in our guidance, but it's something that we're very excited about.OperatorOur next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America.Bradley Hartwell SillsI wanted to ask one on AI here as well. It sounds like some exciting things coming, looking forward to learning more about that. A lot of possibilities here within Small Business and consumer. Would just love to get your perspective on kind of where you're coming from. Sasan, you've alluded to the fact that Intuit is well prepared here because of the platform capabilities here and the underpinnings of that with data. So just curious, any color as to where Intuit is coming from such that you're able to iterate on AI the way that we're looking forward to learning more about?Sasan K. GoodarziYes. Thank you for your question. I'll start with taking you back to 5 years ago when we declared our strategy was to really shift the company from just a tax and accounting platform, which is a very important set of problems to solve for customers to a global financial platform that really played a far more meaningful role in powering the prosperity of consumers and small businesses on a daily basis. When we made that strategic declaration on the 5 bets that ensued, what we talked about at that time was that data and AI was going to be core to making that shift. And in fact, when we made the acquisition of both Credit Karma and Mailchimp, one huge driver of the acquisition was around the data because, in essence, we will know a lot more about customers and we could leverage that data for their benefit to fuel their success. So and even 5 years ago declaring this, data and machine learning has been a decade-long focus of Intuit. So when you think about a decade-long investment in data, usable data, cleaning the data and making sure that it's structured in a way where it can be used and then our investments in AI, specifically in knowledge engineering, which really takes rules and the relationship between data and turns it into code is what our advantages in TurboTax, machine learning and natural language processing, those have been -- it's been a decade-long set of investments and the 2 acquisitions have propelled us forward about 10 years. And then you couple that with what we started several years ago, which is GenAI. And then what we launched in June, which is a generative operating system, GenOS, which by the way, is not something you can create overnight. This is years of investment. When we couple those type of investments, data, AI and GenOS, which is really primarily our own Intuit financial large language models that are trained on our customers' proprietary data, it allows us to personalize things, humanize things and do the work for customers in a way that's revolutionary, which ultimately gets to the punch line of we are creating a future that is done for you. Rather than you having to do the work to run your business, rather than you have to do the work to be able to power your prosperity, manage your finances as a consumer, we want to put you in control where it's done for you. You're always in control, you have the choice of whether or not you move forward with a decision. But we want to be able to help you grow your customers and run your business for you, help you manage your cash flow, always put the right choices in front of you. And the same thing goes on the tax side and Credit Karma side. So that's what's so exciting about -- it's a decade-long focus. We really tripled down on it 5 years ago when we declared our strategy. And we're -- we have now galvanized and energized the entire company that the future of done for you that we declared 5 years ago is very real, very much here. And we had an enormous opportunity to do amazing things for our customers. And that's what really gets us excited about what's possible. And so I can do another advertisement. Join us September 6 for Intuit's Innovation Day, followed by Investor Day, and you'll get a real good feel for the world that we are going to create for the future.OperatorWe'll take our last question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.Scott Andrew SchneebergerWelcome, Sandeep. I have a couple on consumer, one very high level and one, just a clarification. So the first is on...(technical difficulty)Sasan K. GoodarziScott, you cut out on us.Kimberly Anderson WatkinsReza, can you try to bring him back?OperatorScott, your line is open.Scott Andrew SchneebergerSasan, can you hear me?Sasan K. GoodarziWe can now. Yes, if you don't mind, start over again because we lost you.Scott Andrew SchneebergerAbsolutely. So 2 quick on consumer. First, volume and price mix. Just your consideration of that going into fiscal 2024 and beyond given the trends of the recent years. And then for you or Sandeep, just curious in the extension season, in the post-tax season, what did you see? Anything interesting with California? Should we see a shift from fiscal '23 to '24 that's material related to anything extension-wise?Sasan K. GoodarziSure. Let me start with your volume mix question around TurboTax. I would say the way to think about it was what I described earlier, leaning into full service, leaning into business tax and continuing to lean into TurboTax Live, which really comes with assistance, recognizing it's all data and AI driven. You're going to see more come from ARPC than volume, and that's just the nature of the opportunity. Now there is 88 million-plus people that are in the assisted segment and there's $30 billion of spend. So there's both a volume opportunity and an ARPC opportunity. Just our view, looking at the next 10 years, by the way, this is not a 1-year answer, both matter. You're going to get -- we're going to get more from ARPC. And I'll let Sandeep jump in here as well. I mean on the extension season, that's just been very weird with many states that got extended to July and California to October, and what we're seeing from customers is they've even gotten confused which month they have to file in their state. So net-net is there's more to file. When you look at it at the company level, it's really not material, but not everybody has filed yet.Sandeep Singh AujlaThat's basically the answer, Scott. It's not material for our Q1. It's been a unique behavior on the taxpayer. But I'll also remind us that last year, we also saw a great deal of extensions by taxpayers. So that's also something to keep in mind as you look at Q1.Sasan K. GoodarziAll right, everybody. I think that brings our questions or Q&amp;A to an end. Thank you for your wonderful questions. Thank you for spending the time with us. We look forward to seeing you September 6 and at our Investor Day. Take good care. Be safe. Bye, everybody.Sandeep Singh AujlaThank you all.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call.]"

Table B1, Table B2, and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:Share-based compensation expenseAmortization of acquired technologyAmortization of other acquired intangible assetsGoodwill and intangible asset impairment chargesGains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assetsProfessional fees and transaction costs for business combinationsWe also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:Gains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investmentsIncome tax effects and adjustmentsDiscontinued operationsWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit’s operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.Share-based compensation expenses. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names.Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and long-lived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results.Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees.Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments.Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a long-term non-GAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current long-term projections, we are using a long-term non-GAAP tax rate of 24% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant acquisitions, changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate.Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of business and long-lived assets.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230824559857/en/ContactsInvestors Kim WatkinsIntuit Inc.650-944-3324kim_watkins@intuit.comMedia Kali FryIntuit Inc.650-944-3036kali_fry@intuit.com]"

Last year, Powell used this speech to warn of “some pain” ahead in the battle against inflation, hitting the stock market, and any hints about the Fed's rate outlook are sure to reverberate strongly. On Friday, he said inflation was still too high despite progress.“We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving sustainably down toward our objective,"" Powell said in his speech.The Fed is trying to walk a tightrope. Inflation readings have been cooling in the past few months, but prices still aren't back to the Fed's annual 2% target and a still-tight labor market gives officials reason to remain vigilant.The U.S. central bank is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its next meeting in September, but there still remains a chance that it raises by another quarter of a percentage point at its November meeting.Michigan consumer sentiment dueThe University of Michigan's latest consumer sentiment reading is the main economic data release Friday. It came in at a cooler than expected 69.5 for August versus expectations for a reading of 71.2.Story continuesEarlier Friday, data showed that the mood among German businesses deteriorated more than expected in August, falling for the fourth month in a row and adding to fears that the eurozone’s largest economy may be heading for its second recession inside a year.Affirm soars after jump in transactionsThe quarterly earnings season is coming to a close. Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) posted a jump in transactions on its platforms that beat expectations.Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) stock fell 8.2% after the chipmaker posted a fall in second quarter revenue, hit by a weak enterprise market, while Hawaiian Electric (NYSE:HE) slumped 13% after the county of Maui sued the power company, accusing it of acting negligently by failing to shut down its equipment, sparking wildfires.Crude on course for losing weekOil prices firmed Friday, but remained on course for a second consecutive week as concerns over slowing Chinese demand and increased U.S. supply as well as a stronger dollar weighed.The dollar jumped to its strongest level since early June earlier Friday, ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium. Strength in the dollar weighs on oil markets by making crude more expensive for international buyers.(Peter Nurse and Oliver Gray contributed to this item.)Related ArticlesU.S. stocks pare gains after Fed's Powell says prepared to continue raising ratesPrivate equity firm Veritas makes a takeover offer for BlackBerry - sourceAstraZeneca sues US over Medicare drug price negotiation plans]"

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 25.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $16.8 in the previous session. Coursera has gained 41.6% since the start of the year compared to the 8.4% move for the Zacks Business Services sector and the 16.1% return for the Zacks Technology Services industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 27, 2023, Coursera reported EPS of $0 versus consensus estimate of $-0.1 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 5.48%.For the current fiscal year, Coursera is expected to post earnings of -$0.11 per share on $620.92 million in revenues. This represents a 70.27% change in EPS on a 18.55% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.04 per share on $713.32 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 134.55% and 14.88%, respectively.Valuation MetricsCoursera may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Coursera has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Coursera currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Coursera meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Coursera shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does COUR Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of COUR have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Trane Technologies plc (TT). TT has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.Earnings were strong last quarter. Trane Technologies plc beat our consensus estimate by 5.10%, and for the current fiscal year, TT is expected to post earnings of $8.82 per share on revenue of $17.58 billion.Shares of Trane Technologies plc have gained 3.7% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 22.84X and a P/CF of 22.61X.The Technology Services industry is in the top 43% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for COUR and TT, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Overall industrial production rose 1% in the previous month. Both manufacturing and mining output increased 0.5% while the index for utilities climbed 5.4% as very high temperatures raised demand for cooling. Within the manufacturing segment, production of motor vehicles and parts surged 5.2%, while other factory output were up 0.1%.Strong Demand for Mining and ConstructionThe intensifying global focus on shifting from fossil fuels to zero emissions will require a large number of commodities, which, in turn, will support demand for mining equipment in the years to come. The U.S. government's plans to increase investment in infrastructure construction, particularly in critical subsectors, such as transportation, water and sewerage, and telecommunications, should support demand in the coming years.The industry participants are investing in digital initiatives like AI, cloud computing, advanced analytics and robotics. Digital transformation aids organizations in boosting productivity and increasing efficiency, reliability, and safety, thereby enriching customer satisfaction. With the pressing need to cut carbon emissions, companies worldwide are relying more on autonomous machinery.Solid Demand for Farm EquipmentGrowing demand for food to sustain the farm equipment industry and the need to replace aging equipment should spur demand. Farm size has been on the rise in the United States, which calls for more laborers. Given the escalation in labor costs every year, farmers are resorting to equipment to replace labor. Demand for agricultural equipment will continue to be supported by increased global demand for food, both from population growth and an increasing proportion of the population aspiring for better living standards.Customers are increasingly relying on advanced technology, smart farming solutions and mechanization to run their operations. Thus, industry participants are enhancing investments in launching products equipped with advanced technologies and features to keep up with customers' evolving demands.Story continuesInitiatives to advance precision agriculture technology are likely to be game-changers for the industry players, given its productivity-enhancing and sustainability benefits. Demand continues to grow for popular features, which include automatic guide machines in the field and equipment that plants seeds, and applies chemicals and fertilizers with exceptional accuracy.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five industrial products stocks.

329,c94be0f8-af5f-3e31-b6a2-d7587934e0a2,GE,2023-08-25,11 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-most-undervalued-dow-stocks-112318327.html,1692962598,STORY,"['^DJI', 'HD', 'VZ', 'AMGN', 'HON', 'GE', 'DIS', 'UNH', 'CSCO']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 most undervalued Dow stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most historic stock indexes in America, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world. It was set up in 1896 and holds a central place in the history of the stock market as a result. This also lends the index a special status where the stocks that are included in it are called blue chip stocks, which alludes to their high value and overall stability.Stocks included in the Dow index do not stay there forever. The index in its current form which is limited to 30 stocks came into being in 1928 when it was expanded to reflect the roaring market conditions of the time. This time period was one of the most prosperous in the early history of the Dow index, as 1928 marked an eight year bull run that had started in 1920. It started after the end of the first world war which had left an economic recession in the United States and it would end with much worse economic circumstances coming in as the Great Depression would start. In terms of percentage point drops in economic activity, the Great Depression would be fifteen times as bad as the contraction during the Great Recession after the economic crisis in 2008. Like the housing crisis, the Great Depression also began in the U.S. and then spread all over the world, with stocks believed to have lost more than three quarters of value during the time period.After the Great Depression, the next period of turbulence in the Dow would come during the 1970s when the U.S. shifted away from gold and Saudi Arabia led an oil embargo that led to severe inflation all across America along with dropping economic growth as the pumps dried up. The stock market, which as a whole relies on economic growth and prosperity, does not like any turbulence in either the oil supply or the economy, and as a result, the Dow did poorly. The index would continue to withstand turmoil during the next couple of decades, and with the turn of the millennium, it would lag the losses of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 during the time when the devastating September 11 attacks shook markets.Story continuesThe index's history has also seen several companies come and go. The longest running component of the Dow index is believed to be General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric is one of the oldest companies in America, and it was part of the original Dow index of 1896. Keeping its place in the list of elite stocks for 122 years, the firm exited the Dow in 2018. True to its name the ""Dow Jones 'Industrial' Average,"" most of the original constituents of the Dow were industrial companies. However, its reshaping has been influenced by trends in the broader U.S. economy, with the latest additions being some of the most consequential firms of today such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The chairman and managing director of the Dow Indices index's committee Mr. David Blitzer was cognizant of the evolutionary dynamics in the stock market at the time of GE's de-listing, as he commented:Since then [1907] the U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.Right now, five out of the 30 stocks in the Dow index are information technology firms, making it the largest sector in the index. After tech, the largest sector in the index is financial services, and together, the pair represent nine out of the 30 companies in the Dow. Currently, the oldest member of the index is The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which was added in 1932 and the three youngest additions are Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). According to S&amp;P Dow Jones, the change was prompted after Apple split its shares four to one, which ended up affecting the index's weights.Taking stock of the Dow's performance this year, the index has gained a modest 2.91%, which reflects the mixed performance in the U.S. economy. While technology stocks have soared, other areas such as regional banking and real estate haven't fared so well.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$27.5bUS$30.6bUS$33.8bUS$33.5bUS$33.5bUS$33.8bUS$34.2bUS$34.7bUS$35.2bUS$35.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 0.10%Est @ 0.72%Est @ 1.15%Est @ 1.45%Est @ 1.66%Est @ 1.81% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$25.9kUS$27.1kUS$28.3kUS$26.4kUS$24.9kUS$23.6kUS$22.5kUS$21.5kUS$20.6kUS$19.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$241bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$36b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$916bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$916b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$504bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$745b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$488, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most historic stock indexes in America, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world. It was set up in 1896 and holds a central place in the history of the stock market as a result. This also lends the index a special status where the stocks that are included in it are called blue chip stocks, which alludes to their high value and overall stability.Stocks included in the Dow index do not stay there forever. The index in its current form which is limited to 30 stocks came into being in 1928 when it was expanded to reflect the roaring market conditions of the time. This time period was one of the most prosperous in the early history of the Dow index, as 1928 marked an eight year bull run that had started in 1920. It started after the end of the first world war which had left an economic recession in the United States and it would end with much worse economic circumstances coming in as the Great Depression would start. In terms of percentage point drops in economic activity, the Great Depression would be fifteen times as bad as the contraction during the Great Recession after the economic crisis in 2008. Like the housing crisis, the Great Depression also began in the U.S. and then spread all over the world, with stocks believed to have lost more than three quarters of value during the time period.After the Great Depression, the next period of turbulence in the Dow would come during the 1970s when the U.S. shifted away from gold and Saudi Arabia led an oil embargo that led to severe inflation all across America along with dropping economic growth as the pumps dried up. The stock market, which as a whole relies on economic growth and prosperity, does not like any turbulence in either the oil supply or the economy, and as a result, the Dow did poorly. The index would continue to withstand turmoil during the next couple of decades, and with the turn of the millennium, it would lag the losses of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 during the time when the devastating September 11 attacks shook markets.Story continuesThe index's history has also seen several companies come and go. The longest running component of the Dow index is believed to be General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric is one of the oldest companies in America, and it was part of the original Dow index of 1896. Keeping its place in the list of elite stocks for 122 years, the firm exited the Dow in 2018. True to its name the ""Dow Jones 'Industrial' Average,"" most of the original constituents of the Dow were industrial companies. However, its reshaping has been influenced by trends in the broader U.S. economy, with the latest additions being some of the most consequential firms of today such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The chairman and managing director of the Dow Indices index's committee Mr. David Blitzer was cognizant of the evolutionary dynamics in the stock market at the time of GE's de-listing, as he commented:Since then [1907] the U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.Right now, five out of the 30 stocks in the Dow index are information technology firms, making it the largest sector in the index. After tech, the largest sector in the index is financial services, and together, the pair represent nine out of the 30 companies in the Dow. Currently, the oldest member of the index is The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which was added in 1932 and the three youngest additions are Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). According to S&amp;P Dow Jones, the change was prompted after Apple split its shares four to one, which ended up affecting the index's weights.Taking stock of the Dow's performance this year, the index has gained a modest 2.91%, which reflects the mixed performance in the U.S. economy. While technology stocks have soared, other areas such as regional banking and real estate haven't fared so well.

The latest dividend will be paid out on Sep 19, 2023, to its shareholders of record as of Sep 11.Its dividend yield, based on the latest payout and the Aug 23 closing price, is approximately 1.54%. The figure is higher than the industry average of 1.31% and the medical sector, as well as the S&amp;P 500’s level of 1.45%. UnitedHealth’s dividend history shows continuous hikes per annum since 2010.Its shareholder value boosting efforts are backed by a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash-generating ability. UNH exited the second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $46.3 billion, which soared 65.8% from the 2022-end level, while the short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt were at a manageable $6.3 billion. It expects operating cash flow for 2023 to be within $27-$28 billion, implying growth from $26.2 billion in 2022.This highlights UNH’s sound and stable financial position, backed by its strong profitable operations. As a result, the dividend not only looks quite sustainable but also leaves enough scope for future dividend hikes.Investors should note that Optum, UnitedHealth’s health service business, is becoming increasingly valuable and supports its diversification strategy. Its long-term earnings growth potential provides ample capacity to up the dividend for years to come. Our estimate for Optum's top line suggests an increase of 20.3% year over year in 2023.An uptrend in membership trends in UNH’s Commercial business is also a major positive for the health insurer. Moreover, UnitedHealth’s government business, which consists of Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, is expected to continue boosting its performance in the coming days. The company also has a share repurchase program in place to enhance shareholder value, which had up to 21 million shares capacity left at June-end.Story continuesPrice Performance   UnitedHealth shares have gained 2.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 2.9% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksUnitedHealth currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS via Getty Images)The company will not undertake any research and development of drugs, Shah said.But CVS said the strategy is more than just slapping a label on a finished product.""For products that Cordavis co-manufactures, Cordavis will be significantly participating in the manufacturing process with contracted manufacturers, including things like overseeing manufacturing and quality control processes, developing product labeling, and organizing logistics for the products, among other things,"" a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.The 'most value for customers'""We have a strategy to go after the products where we believe we can create the most value for customers, and for the US marketplace where we can increase the competition, lower the cost, and get that cost to consumers, and get these products to consumers at lower prices,"" Shah said.The first product Cordvais will co-manufacture and commercialize is Sandoz's (NVS) Hyrimoz — a biosimilar to AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, which went off patent this year.The Cordavis-branded Hyrimoz will list for 80% less than Humira's price.That's similar to the prices rival OptumRx, a unit of UnitedHealth (UNH), announced last year.JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a note Wednesday that the move is a volume-based transaction with only upside for CVS.Story continues""CVS has committed to purchasing a certain amount of volume from Sandoz and management noted there are no additional capital commitments. CVS anticipates Cordavis will generate positive margins for commercializing the product, but it is too early to size the potential contribution,"" Gill said.OptumRx said its Sandoz-branded biosimilar Hyrimoz would list for 5% less than Humira, and the unbranded for 81% less than Humira, which has a list price of $6,922 per month for the injectable drug.By comparison, Amgen's (AMGN) biosimilar Amjevita lists for 55% less than Humira for the unbranded version and 5% less for the branded version.Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs is dispensing Coherus' Yusimry, another biosimilar for Humira, for about $570, plus fees, per month.Specialty drugs in demandCordavis launched as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS, and is targeting the costly specialty drug market — which accounted for 50% of drug spend in the US in 2021 despite being used by only 2% of the population.Humira and its biosimilars fall into that category.The drug industry has focused more of its efforts in recent years to target specialty drug launches. Those efforts, paired with a number of patent cliffs for blockbuster drugs held by big pharma companies, is providing a market ripe for competition.""Over the next 10 years, we're seeing this biosimllar competition come into the US marketplace, and we want to ensure adoption of these products,"" Shah said.But it's also an area facing historic shortages as supply chain issues hamper product output.Cancer drugs as well as diabetes drugs, like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic, have made it to the FDA's drug shortage list this year. That's why Shah said CVS intends to select products that can provide adequate supply.""When we're converting patients to these clinically complex equivalent [products] ... we want to make sure we don't run out of supply, and there [have] been supply issues with certain other products,"" Shah said, which outlines why the company chose Sandoz's biosimilar for its launch.“Cordavis is a logical evolution for us and will help ensure sufficient supply of biosimilars in the US and support this market now and in the future, while ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing costs for consumers,"" CVS CFO Shawn Guertin said Wednesday.""Let's be really clear. Our job is to drive the prices down as low as possible for our clients.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the stock market and the performance of ETFs, head directly to 5 Best Performing ETFs in 2023. Amid concerns about the unpredictable economy and rapid stock market movements, strategies focused on safe investments are largely preferred by investors in 2023. In June 2023, the chief investment officer at Astoria Portfolio Advisors, John Davi, joined CNBC’s “ETF Edge” and highlighted three big ETF trends he’s seeing this year. Davi noted that bond ETFs have attracted $82 billion in investments this year, as opposed to $55 billion that has entered equity funds. Another trend highlighted by Davi is the disparity in flow patterns between non-U.S. and U.S. ETFs. Among equity ETFs, non-U.S. funds have received $40 billion in investments this year, while U.S. equities have secured $14 billion. Lasly, the shift from value to growth is an important trend to watch. Also Read: 12 Best NASDAQ ETFsAccording to Natixis Investment Managers, there has been a significant decline in the influx of investments into equity ETFs in 2023 compared to the relatively steady flow observed in 2022. In contrast, fixed income ETFs have maintained a consistently robust and favorable net flow throughout this year. The firm expects that this upward trend in fixed income ETFs will continue due to the influence of three ongoing factors. Firstly, investor apprehension regarding an economic recession that might trigger a decline in the stock market; secondly, the appeal of exceptionally favorable short-term interest rates; and thirdly, concerns about potential bank failures. Moreover, the present state of the market might further strengthen investors' preference for active ETF management, given that notable market volatility has generated opportunities for active managers to capitalize on. Furthermore, over the course of 2023, Natixis expects an increase in the number of options-related ETFs. Data extracted from Strategic Insight's Simfund indicates a more than twofold growth in assets from 2020 onwards, which suggests a greater level of investor interest towards options overlays. Story continuesDon't Miss: 10 Best Industrial ETFsThe global ETF market has gained remarkable momentum in the last half-decade.

Most notably, crypto market cap has declined from a peak of ~$3 Trillion last fall, to ~$1.1 Trillion today (a -63% decline, and -72% peak-to-trough; LINK). Crypto is a volatile asset class, and has experienced many draw-downs of similar magnitude in the past. For example, Bitcoin was down -93% during 2011, -85% from 2013-15, and -84% from 2017-18. In this context, the latest draw-down is a pretty normal outcome for this emerging asset class.A large reason for this volatility is simply because there aren’t any major “real-world use cases” for the asset just yet. In our letter outlining the investment last year, we wrote that crypto is still “in the middle of ‘crossing the chasm’ into mainstream adoption &amp; use cases, which will result in millions of mainstream users needing to transact crypto in some form”…” (Click here to see the full text)8.

Perhaps I have spent too much time discussing these dichotomies, as generally, I feel like if we pick the right stocks and manage market exposures thoughtfully, our equities- oriented portfolio will prosper across various market cycles. However, when markets become as lopsided as they have lately, I feel additional discussion on the market environment is worthwhile, if only to help highlight the opportunities that are available and the likely path forward. I expect future discussions to soon be focused again on our moderately concentrated portfolio. But for now, let’s take one last in-depth look at how far reaching these valuation dichotomies have again become.(Please note: charts that accompany the following can be found in the Appendix.)Take Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for example. It is the largest stock by market cap, and fairly considered one of the best companies in the world. The company has been extraordinarily successful and improved standards of living everywhere in the process with their ubiquitous products. Along the way, shareholders have been richly rewarded, with shares increasing nearly fourteen-fold over the last ten years while generating an annualized total shareholder return of 31%, including dividends.On the back of another big quarter for large cap tech, it is now the first stock to surpass the $3T market cap threshold. This makes its weighting in the ~$37T market cap of the S&amp;P 500, ~8%. It also means this one stock’s market cap is larger than that of the entire ~$2.98T market cap of the Russell 2000 index, the first time in history a single stock has outweighed the Russell 2000 – aside from two brief days in September 2020 when Apple’s market cap then accomplished the same…” (Click here to read the full text)7.

Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI). Given his track record and its standing as one of Americas top homebuilding companies, this move certainly piques the interest of many.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with MRVL. Click here to check it out. DHI 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DHIThis discussion aims to dissect D.R. Horton's business model, competitive landscape and financial metrics to unravel the potential allure for Buffett.D.R. Horton overviewFounded in 1978, D.R. Horton has earned its reputation as Americas largest homebuilder. The company has cultivated a legacy of delivering high-quality homes tailored to the diverse needs of American families. By staying attuned to market shifts and maintaining a reputation for quality, it has achieved remarkable growth in its decades of operation.Business model and core servicesD.R. Hortons cornerstone lies in designing, constructing and marketing single-family detached homes for both novice and seasoned buyers. It prides itself on affordability, making homeownership feasible for a broad clientele range.The companys business is structured in a way that covers all the bases of the home-buying process:Homebuilding: This includes the acquisition and development of land, followed by the subsequent construction and sale of homes. The company caters to an array of segments, from entry-level to luxury homes, ensuring a broad market appeal.Financial services: The company provides homebuyers mortgage financing and title agency services, simplifying the buying process by integrating these crucial steps. D.R. Hortons in-house financial services help guide homebuyers through the often-complicated purchase process.Rental properties: The company has ventured into the rental business, constructing and managing single-family rental properties, a growing sector given the rising demand for such dwellings.Story continuesWhile the homebuilding segment remains the primary revenue generator, diversifying through financial services and rental properties allows D.R. Horton to leverage its expertise and attain alternative revenue streams. Given the cyclical nature of the real estate market, this diversified approach could serve as a cushion during downturns.Competitive landscapeIn understanding D.R. Hortons prospects, it is crucial to evaluate its position amidst competitors and assess the factors that give it a competitive edge or potential vulnerabilities.Starting with its strengths, the company has broad market appeal. Catering from entry-level to luxury homes allows D.R. Horton to maintain demand across varying economic conditions.Further, as one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., the company benefits from economies of scale, leading to reduced costs and improved operational efficiency.It also benefits from its integrated services. Offering mortgage and title services streamlines the buying process for customers, making D.R. Horton a one-stop solution.As for potential risks and vulnerabilities, the housing industry is sensitive to economic cycles. Recessions can lead to reduced demand, potentially impacting revenues.There are also regulatory hurdles. Stringent regulations and zoning laws can impact the rate at which new projects are undertaken.Finally, higher interest rates can decrease the affordability of mortgages, leading to diminished home sales.Buffett often stresses the importance of investing in businesses with a wide moat, suggesting that such companies are better positioned to withstand competition over time. D.R. Hortons diverse offerings and integrated services could be considered elements of its moat, offering some insulation against potential industry headwinds.Quantitative analysisAt the heart of any companys valuation lies the price-earnings ratio, a metric that compares a companys stock price to its earnings per share. For D.R. Horton, this figure stands at 8.39, marginally undercutting the industry average of 8.43. When viewed in isolation, this figure suggests the company is approximately in line with the industry's valuation.The price-book ratio is pegged at 1.84, significantly higher than the industry average of 1.01. The ratio, indicative of the valuation related to a companys net asset value, suggests investors are currently willing to pay more for the company's assets than its peers.While a higher price-book ratio might raise eyebrows for value investors, it is important to consider the reasons behind such a premium. A ratio greater than the industry average can indicate potential overvaluation, but it can also signify that the market anticipates robust future growth or other favorable factors.D.R. Hortons current ratio, a measure of a companys ability to cover its short-term obligations, stands tall at 12.04. Such a high ratio underscores the companys robust liquidity position, indicating its ability to settle short-term obligations without any issues.Leverage is a double-edged sword in the corporate world. While it can amplify returns, excessive debt can be detrimental. D.R. Hortons debt-to-equity ratio, a metric reflecting the proportion of equity and debt the company uses to finance its assets, stands at 0.28. In comparison, the industry average hovers at 0.54. This implies D.R. Horton has been judicious in its use of debt.Book value and EPS growthHistorically, D.R. Horton has exhibited a 10-year average annual growth of 18.7% in book value per share and a staggering 131.5% in earnings per share. The consistent growth in book value indicates the company has been effective in augmenting shareholder value year over year.Moreover, the earnings per share growth over the past decade is nothing short of impressive. Such robust growth in earnings is indicative of the companys successful strategies in boosting its profitability.Potential reasons why Buffett investedWhile we cannot know for sure what caused the guru to invest in the company until he comments on it, D.R. Horton does have some appealing aspects.The first is its robust business model. Buffett is known for valuing companies with a clear and sustainable business model. D.R. Hortons multifaceted approach, encompassing homebuilding, financial services and rental properties, offers diversified revenue streams, potentially ensuring stable returns.Second, the company has a wide moat. Buffetts philosophy often leans toward businesses that have a competitive advantage or a wide moat. D.R. Hortons integrated services and broad market appeal can be seen as elements of this moat, providing a degree of protection against industry headwinds.Third, it has consistent growth. The companys impressive historical progression, particularly in earnings per share growth, is indicative of a successful and scalable business model.Finally, D.R. Hotron's financial health appears to be robust. With a high current ratio, the company has a strong liquidity position. Moreover, its judicious use of debt, as evidenced by its debt-to-equity ratio, is in line with Buffetts preference for companies with sound financial practices.ConclusionBuffetts investment choices are always anchored in profound business understanding and diligent research. While we can only speculate about the precise factors drawing him to D.R. Horton, our exploration certainly underscores the companys formidable position in its sector.

(NASDAQ:PFG) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.65 on the 29th of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the dividend yield to 3.4%, which shareholders will be pleased with. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group Principal Financial Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, Principal Financial Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 26.2%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendPrincipal Financial Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.60. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 12% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To Come ByThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. In the last five years, Principal Financial Group's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 5.3% per annum. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Principal Financial Group's DividendIn summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. The earnings coverage is acceptable for now, but with earnings on the decline we would definitely keep an eye on the payout ratio. This looks like it could be a good dividend stock going forward, but we would note that the payout ratio has been at higher levels in the past so it could happen again.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Overall industrial production rose 1% in the previous month.

Within the manufacturing segment, production of motor vehicles and parts surged 5.2%, while other factory output were up 0.1%.Strong Demand for Mining and ConstructionThe intensifying global focus on shifting from fossil fuels to zero emissions will require a large number of commodities, which, in turn, will support demand for mining equipment in the years to come. The U.S. government's plans to increase investment in infrastructure construction, particularly in critical subsectors, such as transportation, water and sewerage, and telecommunications, should support demand in the coming years.The industry participants are investing in digital initiatives like AI, cloud computing, advanced analytics and robotics. Digital transformation aids organizations in boosting productivity and increasing efficiency, reliability, and safety, thereby enriching customer satisfaction. With the pressing need to cut carbon emissions, companies worldwide are relying more on autonomous machinery.Solid Demand for Farm EquipmentGrowing demand for food to sustain the farm equipment industry and the need to replace aging equipment should spur demand. Farm size has been on the rise in the United States, which calls for more laborers. Given the escalation in labor costs every year, farmers are resorting to equipment to replace labor. Demand for agricultural equipment will continue to be supported by increased global demand for food, both from population growth and an increasing proportion of the population aspiring for better living standards.Customers are increasingly relying on advanced technology, smart farming solutions and mechanization to run their operations. Thus, industry participants are enhancing investments in launching products equipped with advanced technologies and features to keep up with customers' evolving demands.Story continuesInitiatives to advance precision agriculture technology are likely to be game-changers for the industry players, given its productivity-enhancing and sustainability benefits.

Shares have lost about 3.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Sherwin-Williams due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Sherwin-Williams Beats on Q2 Earnings &amp; Sales, Ups ViewSherwin-Williams logged second-quarter 2023 earnings (as reported) of $3.07 per share, up around 38.9% from $2.21 in the year-ago quarter.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter were $3.29 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71.Sherwin-Williams posted revenues of $6,240.6 million, up around 6.3% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,016.5 million. The uptick was primarily attributable to higher selling prices, which influenced sales by a mid-single-digit percentage, as well as volume growth in the mid-single digits due to higher architectural sales volume in the Paint Stores Group.  This was offset by lower volume in the industrial businesses. Acquisitions contributed 1.4% to the consolidated net sales increase.Segmental ReviewThe Paint Stores Group segment registered net sales of $3,498.7 million in the second quarter, up around 10% year over year. The figure surpassed our estimate of $3,340 million. The upside was mainly owing to higher selling prices and volume growth in most end markets.Net sales in the Consumer Brands Group segment rose 5.1% year over year to $945.8 million, beating our estimate of $874 million. Higher selling prices and volume growth across Latin America and Europe were partly offset by reduced sales volume in North America and Asia.Net sales in the Performance Coatings Group rose roughly 0.3% year over year to around $1,794.9 million in the reported quarter, beating our estimate of $1,738 million. The upside was mainly driven by selling price increases in all markets and acquisitions, offset by lower volumes in most regions.Story continuesFinancialsAt the end of the second quarter, Sherwin-Williams had cash and cash equivalents of $209.4 million, down 33% year over year. Long-term debt increased around 5.8% year over year to $9,095.7 million.During the first six months of 2023, the company generated $1.29 billion in net operating cash, a 102% increase over the same period in 2022. During the first six months of 2023, the company returned $848.7 million in cash to its shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases of 2.3 million shares.OutlookThe company has raised its sales and earnings guidance for 2023. The company expects consolidated net sales to be up or down low-single-digit percentage year over year for the third quarter. For 2023, it is projected to be up a low-single-digit percentage.The company expects earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $8.46-$8.86, up from its prior view of $6.79-$7.59.  Adjusted earnings are projected to be $9.30-$9.70 per share, up from the prior guidance of $7.95-$8.65How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted 9.14% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Sherwin-Williams has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Sherwin-Williams has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

357,b47feb2c-742b-3ec5-b4ee-e95facceb235,AWK,2023-08-25,3 ESG Stocks to Buy as Climate Change Sends Temps Soaring,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-esg-stocks-buy-climate-134209474.html,1692366129,STORY,"['NEE', 'ARRY', 'AWK']","[Chalk it up to whatever you’d like but temperatures are rising globally. Every summer there are reports of extreme heat and this year’s reports from Death Valley highlighted extreme temperatures there. That, of course, doesn’t prove climate change is responsible. It’s simply one event in one region. This had let to the rise of stocks to buy for climate change.However, given that global temperatures are set to reach new records in the next five years, climate change is occurring. Whether it’s a natural pattern shift or a man-made phenomenon will continue to polarize its discussion. Whatever the cause though, climate change is making ESG stocks relevant again. Let’s look at a few of them in depth. NextEra Energy (NEE)Environmental conservation technology and approaching global sustainable ESG by clean energy and power from renewable natural resources. AI and green energy.Source: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.comI’m left scratching my head when it comes to NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) and its stock. The company is fundamentally doing very well and is as diversified an energy firm as you’re likely to see. However, its shares have steadily moved downward throughout 2023. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNextEra Energy is part public utility, part green energy firm. Florida Power &amp; Light provides the company with steady revenues and operations while NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) comprises a massive green energy growth business. FPL is America’s largest electric utility while NEER is the world’s largest producer of solar and wind energy. That introduction aside, NextEra Energy is doing very well but continues to move downward. Revenues and income are improving during both the Q2 and H1 periods and the firm expects 6-8% growth in 2023. NEE shares include a dividend and there’s a lot of upside inherent in those shares even before adding the dividend into potential returns. I think it’s an easy choice as the climate gets hotter and hotter. Array Technologies (ARRY)Image of a person holding a lit lightbulbSource: ShutterstockArray Technologies (NYSE:ARRY) remains a screaming buy of stock even after it jumped up $4 on Aug. 9. The company provides ground-mounting systems that optimize solar panel positioning leading to greater efficiency and energy capture. Story continuesThe big news was that Array Technologies’ sales reached $508 million whereas Wall Street was expecting $449 million. That led to a $52 million profit and a reversal in EPS fortunes which shited from negative 10 cents to 5 cents in the black. The news sent shares soaring from $17 to $21 immediately and set Array Technologies up to continue to prosper. Its success is intimately connected to the continued growth in demand for solar arrays and installations. All in all, this makes it one of those stocks to buy for climate change.Even though ARRY shares now trade near $23 additional room remains for growth based on price forecasts. Increasing temperatures should correlate to greater amounts of sunshine as well. That will make solar panels more feasible in a greater range geographically. In theory, that gives investors another reason to consider investing in Array Technologies. American Water Works (AWK)Flooded quarry for limestone mining. Turquoise water. White beaches. Water stocks.Source: Klintsou Ihar / Shutterstock.comA hotter world will favor American Water Works (NYSE:AWK) and its stock. The company provides water and wastewater services to regulated and market-based businesses comprising normal businesses and U.S. military installations. The logic in investing in publicly-traded firms as temperatures rise is as straightforward as can be. American Water Works sw its earnings rise this year. Earnings increased on both a Q2 and first-half basis. The company increased prices which more than offset increasing costs due to inflation and rising pension obligation. American Water Works is the largest regulated water and wastewater firm in the U.S. serving more than 14 million customers across 14 states and 18 military installations. Its size is one of the primary reasons to consider it over other water utilities. Further, it has a diverse geographic footprint due to the military installations and their distributed nature. AWK includes a modest dividend as well. It should be easy to understand that American Water Resources is at least worth considering given the signs of water insecurity that have already begun to emerge.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The Nasdaq has lost more than 7.2% in the last three weeks, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 4.6%, its worst three-week decline since the Mar 10 week.Bond Yields SoarThe recent jump in bond yields is taking a toll on the stock market. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.366% on Aug 22, hitting its highest level since 2007 and up nearly 40 bps month to date.An increase in bond yields reduces the appeal of a stock's future earnings. This is because higher bond yields provide investors with the opportunity to get lucrative returns from investments that are considerably safer in comparison to stocks.The recent rise in bond yields came just after the release of minutes of the Fed’s July FOMC that revealed that central bank officials are maintaining a hawkish stance as they believe that more interest rate hikes would be required to ease inflationary pressures. Every time interest rates increase, bond prices fall, which increases their yield.Fed Open for More Rate HikesInflation has sharply declined and nearly halved from its 40-year-high of 9.1% in June 2022. However, the Fed is open to more interest rate hikes as inflation is still elevated and a lot higher than its 2% target.Meanwhile, investors’ sentiments were dented further after the S&amp;P Global Ratings on Aug 21 cut the credit ratings on five regional banks with high commercial real estate exposure. This comes after Fitch Ratings, earlier this month, downgraded the U.S. long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating from AAA to AA+.Also, credit rating agency Moody’s, earlier this month, downgraded several banks and kept six on review for potential downgrades.Story continuesWorries Over ChinaChina's economic worries are further hurting investor confidence. The decrease in China's exports and imports is primarily attributed to weakened demand for goods on a global scale.China is grappling with deflation and substantial debt, which have the potential to impact economies worldwide.Our ChoicesIn order to secure one's portfolio, we have narrowed our search to five stocks from the defensive sectors, such as consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this food and beverage company have returned -7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which PepsiCo falls in, has lost 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $2.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.48 points to a change of +10.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.05 indicates a change of +7.6% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $92.18 billion and $96.81 billion estimates indicate +6.7% and +5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $22.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.4%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.86 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.3%. The EPS surprise was +7.18%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Among these, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN was in the spotlight as it finally gained the FDA’s nod for a higher dose of its lead drug Eylea.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Updates From Regeneron: Shares of Regeneron gained after the FDA approved an 8mg dose of aflibercept injection for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy under the brand name Eylea HD. A 2 mg dose of aflibercept is already approved under the brand name Eylea for various ophthalmology indications. The approval by the regulatory body was based on the 48-week results of two studies, PULSAR and PHOTON, which compared Eylea HD to aflibercept injection at 2 mg. Data from these studies showed that Eylea HD demonstrated clinically equivalent vision gains to Eylea, which were maintained with fewer injections.Concurrently, the regulatory body approved pozelimab-bbfg for treating adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older with CHAPLE disease, also known as CD55-deficient protein-losing enteropathy. The candidate has been approved under the brand name Veopoz in the United States. Per Regeneron, Veopoz is the first and only treatment indicated specifically for CHAPLE, an ultra-rare hereditary disease that can cause potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms.Earlier, the European Medicines Agency accepted for review the company’s marketing authorization application (MAA) for pipeline candidate odronextamab. The MAA is seeking approval of the candidate to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma or R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who have progressed after at least two prior systemic therapies.Setback for Gilead: Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD suffers a setback in developing its oncology candidate, magrolimab. The FDA has placed a partial clinical hold on new patient starts in studies evaluating magrolimab to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the United States.Story continuesAs a result of the hold, screening and enrollment of new study participants under the U.S. investigational new drug application (IND 147229) and U.S. Expanded Access Program will be paused. Nevertheless, patients already enrolled in AML studies may continue to receive treatment and be monitored according to the current study protocol. The candidate is a potential first-in-class anti-CD47 immunotherapy and is being evaluated for several potential indications, including ongoing trials in solid tumors. Management stated that studies of magrolimab in solid tumors can continue without any impact from this hold.Earlier, the late-stage ENHANCE study on magrolimab in higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes was discontinued. The decision to suspend the ENHANCE study was based on a planned analysis that indicated futility in achieving the study's primary endpoints, which were focused on complete response and overall survival.Gilead currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novavax Vaccine Updates: Novavax, Inc. NVAX announced that its updated protein-based XBB COVID vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibody responses in neutralizing antibodies against emerging subvariants the EG.5.1 (also known as ‘Eris’) and XBB.1.16.6 in studies on small animals and non-human primate. XBB sublineage variants currently account for the majority of COVID cases in the United States and the European Union. The vaccine has been designed to target the XBB descendent lineage viruses. NVAX shares gained on the news.Novavax had earlier announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for its updated COVID-19 vaccine and intends to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. Management stated that it is manufacturing the updated vaccine commercially and planning to launch it in the upcoming fall.Apellis Gains on Safety Update:  Shares of Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. APLS soared after the company provided an update on injection kits and an update on the rare events of retinal vasculitis reported in real-world treatment with Syfovre (pegcetacoplan injection) for geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The drug was approved for these indications in February 2023.The company received reports of retinal vasculitis (or inflammation) following treatment with Syfovre (pegcetacoplan injection) in July.  The company examined these cases along with the American Society of Retina Specialists' Research and Safety in Therapeutics (ReST). These events occurred between seven and 13 days after the initial administration of the drug, with no specific lots implicated.Apellis partnered with ReST and has been closely monitoring and investigating the occurrences of retinal vasculitis.  The company updated the number of confirmed adverse events to eight (five occlusive and three non-occlusive). Two of these events followed injections in April, three in May and three in June. All these events occurred after the initial administration of Syfovre.During the comprehensive investigation into real-world safety events, Apellis discovered internal structural variation in 19-gauge x 1½ inch filter needles in some injection kits. These filter needles play a crucial role in withdrawing medication from vials during the preparation of injection procedures. As a precautionary measure, Apellis recommends healthcare practitioners to not use injection kits containing the 19-gauge filter needle and switch to kits equipped with the 18-gauge filter needle, which are already in distribution.Fulcrum Gains on Hold Removal: Shares of clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc. FULC surged after the company announced that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on the investigational new drug (IND) application seeking approval of FTX-6058 for the potential treatment of sickle-cell disease (SCD).The FDA placed the clinical hold on the IND in February 2023. The regulatory body noted preclinical data previously submitted in April, October and December 2022, and non-clinical and clinical evidence of hematological malignancies observed with other inhibitors of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Thereafter, Fulcrum suspended dosing in the phase Ib trial of FTX-6058 and worked diligently with the agency to resolve the hold. Fulcrum plans to resume enrollment for patients with SCD shortly.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 1.53% in the past five trading sessions. Among the biotech giants, Moderna has gained 16.72% during the period. Over the past six months, shares of Moderna have plunged 22.73%.

362,935e2755-2c9a-3bf0-a4b7-c4cb318f9ce6,UNP,2023-08-25,Read This Before Considering Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) For Its Upcoming US$1.30 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/read-considering-union-pacific-corporation-100402501.html,1692957842,STORY,['UNP'],"[Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Union Pacific's shares on or after the 30th of August, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$5.20 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Union Pacific stock has a trailing yield of around 2.3% on the current share price of $222.52. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Union Pacific's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Union Pacific's payout ratio is modest, at just 47% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 58% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's not ideal to see Union Pacific's earnings per share have been shrinking at 3.8% a year over the previous five years.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Union Pacific has lifted its dividend by approximately 14% a year on average.The Bottom LineFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Union Pacific? Its earnings per share have been declining meaningfully, although it is paying out less than half its income and more than half its cash flow as dividends. Neither payout ratio appears an immediate concern, but we're concerned about the earnings. Overall we're not hugely bearish on the stock, but there are likely better dividend investments out there.If you want to look further into Union Pacific, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Union Pacific you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Joining me on the call today are Executive Chair, Bob Martin; Chief Executive Officer, Richard Dickson; and Chief Financial Officer, Katrina O'Connell. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.Story continuesBobby L. MartinThank you, Emily, and good afternoon, everyone. Before Katrina shares our second quarter results, I have the pleasure of welcoming our new Chief Executive Officer, Richard Dickson, to the call. There's no denying that Richard was destined for this role at this moment. His experience as a transformational brand builder makes him a perfect fit for this great company. He's uniquely qualified to lead and carry out the transformative work already underway and, more importantly, he is the right leader for tomorrow, defining the future for Gap Inc. Appointed to our Board of Directors in November of 2022, he's had a view into how we are changing the way we work and the results we deliver. But what energizes him most is building a new legacy for our renowned portfolio of brands, one that matters to our customers, employees and shareholders. And before I hand off, I want to say thank you to our entire Gap Inc. team for their commitment to the success of this company and their tenacity and care for our brands, for embracing operational rigor and regaining the product and customer obsession with an eye on modernizing the way we work, all of which becomes a strong foundation for what's ahead under Richard's leadership. I have great belief that Richard and this team will define a very bright future for this company. So with that, I want to welcome Richard Dickson, the new Chief Executive Officer of Gap Inc. Richard?Richard DicksonWell, good afternoon. This is my third official day as CEO of Gap Inc. So first, let me begin by thanking Bobby, the Board and the entire Gap Inc. organization for the opportunity to lead this incredible company. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter 2023 earnings call. Now many have asked me, why Gap Inc. and why now. So let me start by saying that I have admired Gap Inc. and its brands, Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta, for decades as a customer, a brand builder and, most recently, as a Board member. Those of you who know a bit about my career know that I've always been drawn to companies and brands with storied legacies and powerful purposes. And in apparel, there's no equal to Gap Inc. When Don and Doris Fisher opened the very first Gap store in San Francisco in 1969, little do they know that they had tapped into the zeitgeist in a way that would democratize and define American style. Suddenly, great clothes were accessible. Stores were experiential. Self-expression could be an everyday pursuit; open to all. Talk about a game changer; Gap did that. Creating an opportunity from the currents of culture has been a hallmark of Gap Inc. for more than 5 decades. Over the years, our brands made jeans, khakis, kidswear, suits, yoga pants, you name it, into massive trends through great design, great marketing and an all-out obsession with our customer. Fast forward to today, the apparel and retail landscape has changed dramatically. Evolving at an even quicker pace now, it requires that great brands run at the speed of culture to maintain relevance. What has not changed is the customer's desire for fashion that they can make their own. We will take that one step further, making what we do, what we stand for and what we sell relevant. As anyone in this industry will tell you, clothing is a rational need while fashion is an emotional want. Our brands will balance both. Going forward, I'm confident that we have the scale, talent and determination to spark huge, defining trends again. Think about it. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty apparel company in America, an empowered community of more than 90,000 people who apply their talents to Gap Inc. and our brands, producing about 900 million units a year. Our brands draw 600 million visits to stores and $1.4 billion to our sites online each year, making Gap Inc. the #2 player in U.S. apparel e-commerce. These customers across multiple generations turn to Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta to help them step out everywhere from schools and studios to offices and date nights. So our brands matter, but it can matter even more. In my previous role in toys and entertainment, we always strive to make consumers fans and to grow those fandoms, and I want to apply that approach to our portfolio of brands, a virtuous cycle where our products and experiences motivate belief and loyalty that fans then badge and amplify in culture, growing the fandom, validating and inspiring us to even greater creativity and monetization. It works because everyone wins. Gap Inc. brands already have incredible fans. Our job now will be to excite and delight them even more, growing their numbers and the value of our brands. The comprehensive transformation effort that Bobby initiated has been an important step in that direction, streamlining operations so that we could focus on growth-driving initiatives. And Katrina will take you through that progress, in addition to the quarterly performance in detail. But before she does, I want to acknowledge that restructuring is challenging and that change of this magnitude doesn't come fast. Transformation is difficult. Still, our people at every level of the organization have stepped up, made tough calls and championed the progress we've made so far. And we're going to keep going. As we continue to focus on strengthening our financial footing, we're now going to build on that progress, accelerating our efforts to drive profitable growth by unlocking the value in our brands. This time, we'll do it differently with a clear focus on brand revitalization, redefining our brands meaning to consumers, focusing on creativity, designing for relevance as a pursuit rather than a goal, building to quality and leveraging our remarkable legacy to shape an exciting new future. That's my passion. It's why I'm here and why I'm here now. And I know that our teams are just as passionate and committed to making it happen. In the quarters to come, I'll share specific priorities and plans. What I can tell you today is that I'm intent on reigniting a creative culture at Gap Inc. that is a magnet for the industry's best talent, including the great, creative talent we already have; recommitting each of our brands to a distinctive brand purpose that aligns with customer values and sets them apart; reorienting our brands around both the art and science of design-centric thinking informed by consumer insights in an absolute obsession with our customer; reengaging in the cultural conversation with hyper-relevant products and ideas that inspire constructive dialogues; and rethinking how our brands show up in store and online with customer experiences that excite and delight; most of all, mattering to our people, our investors, our communities and the world. In the coming weeks, I look forward to spending time in every part of the organization, our headquarters offices, stores, customer support centers, DCs and with partners in key regions of the U.S. and globally, meeting the people behind our brands, the customers who shop us and you, our shareholders, listening, learning, experiencing it all firsthand in order to get grounded and even more defined about where we're going. I'll wrap up by saying that my start date was deliberate. Just as August 22, 1969 was the milestone that created this remarkable company, I want August 22, 2023, to mark the start of an exciting new chapter for Gap Inc., one that celebrates our past as we pioneer an extraordinary future. Thank you. And I'll now hand off the call to Katrina.Katrina O'ConnellThank you, Richard. It's been a pleasure working with you in your role as a Board member over the past 9 months, and I'm thrilled to partner with you in your new role as CEO. Let me start with some reflections on our financial performance before I dive into more detail. Notably, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and improve cash flows, reducing inventory 29% year-over-year, generating over $300 million of free cash flow, further paying down our ABL balance and ending the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.4 billion, nearly twice as much as last year. Even in a choppy consumer market, each of our brands maintained or gained share during the quarter, fueled particularly by strength in our women's business through great style and relevant fashion. We delivered net sales within our previously communicated guidance range despite a weak apparel environment. We substantially completed the organizational changes that we previewed earlier this year, which we continue to expect will drive about $300 million in cost savings annually but, more importantly, will change how we work, allowing teams to be more consumer-centric. We continue to successfully recoup the excess air costs we incurred during the pandemic. That, combined with improved unit sell-through rates driving AURs, enabled meaningful gross margin expansion despite the inflationary cost headwinds we have faced. And we believe the actions to improve our operations and shore up the foundation of Gap Inc. continue to position us well as we enter the second half of fiscal 2023 and beyond. While we're pleased with this progress, we're mindful of the mixed economic and consumer environment in which we are operating. With that backdrop, we continue to plan the business prudently. And the outlook we're providing today for both the third quarter and fiscal 2023 does contemplate the headwinds we continue to navigate in the second half of the year while also taking on new challenges like the resumption of student loan payments. Let me start now with our second quarter results. Net sales of $3.5 billion decreased 8% versus last year, in the range of our expectations for second quarter sales to be down mid- to high single digits. Store sales decreased 7% from the prior year. Online sales decreased 11% versus last year and represented 33% of total net sales in the quarter. As a reminder, the sale of Gap China completed at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 had about a $60 million or a 2-point negative impact to net sales growth. There was also a 1-point foreign exchange headwind. Excluding these factors, total company net sales would have been down about 5%. Comparable sales were down 6% in the quarter. In spite of the sales declines, we're pleased to report that all 4 of our brands gained or maintained market share during the second quarter, with particular strength in women's. We know that regardless of market conditions, strong brands, brands that matter, win. So we remain focused on the levers and opportunities in our control to deliver on behalf of our customers, employees and shareholders. Let me now provide some sales color and highlights by brand, starting with Old Navy. Net sales in the second quarter were $1.96 billion. Both net sales and comparable sales declined 6% versus last year. We're pleased that Old Navy again modestly gained share in the quarter despite increased softness in the active category as well as continued slower demand from the lower-income consumer. We believe that Old Navy remains well positioned given its value orientation in the marketplace. The Old Navy team has lined up great marketing, product and value to compete in the important back-to-school season. Turning to Gap brand. Gap brand total sales of $755 million were down 14% versus last year and comparable sales were down 1%. Excluding the negative impacts to sales of 7 points related to the sale of Gap China, 2 points due to the shutdown of Yeezy Gap and the estimated 1 point from foreign exchange, net sales were down 4% versus last year, predominantly driven by store closures in North America. Women's was the standout segment in the quarter, outpacing the market as the brand's reinvented icons are resonating with consumers. Gap continues to make great strides with exciting collaborations and partnerships as the brand executes against its strategy to reimagine its product icons in new and exciting ways. Earlier this month, Gap brand partnered with LoveShackFancy on a limited-edition, multi-category capsule for every generation. The collaboration merges Gap's iconic styles with LoveShackFancy's vintage-inspired florals and feminine silhouettes. This most recent collaboration is a prime example of how Gap strategy of partnering with relevant brands and individuals can create buzz and marketing for the brand, reaching new consumers and garnering more premium pricing.Turning to Banana Republic. Second quarter sales of $480 million declined 11% year-over-year. Comparable sales were down 8%. Revenue remains impacted in the short term as the brand laps an outsized benefit last year driven by the dramatic shift in customer preferences. BR continues to make impressive strides in its evolution to a premium lifestyle brand. Fine fabrics like linen, cashmere and leather showed signs of strength in the quarter, and the brand expects to maximize them in the back half of the year. Banana Republic's transformation towards a more evolved lifestyle position is coming to life through an elevated fashion aesthetic and more full-price selling. As we look to the future, we're excited to see the brand extend its vision and refined aesthetic to other addressable markets with BR Home, including the launch of premium bedding, rugs, pillows and decor in March and the upcoming debut of a broader home offering this fall. Athleta sales of $341 million declined 1% from the prior year. Comparable sales were down 7%, an improvement in trend from Q1. Sales in core performance bottoms, the critical backbone of Athleta's assortment, accelerated throughout the quarter and outperformed total brand sales. Athleta's positioning, empowering a community of active women and girls to reach their true potential through the power of she is as relevant and impactful as ever. The work the team has been doing to improve product presentation customer experience and creative in the short term, optimizing online marketing, site merchandising and resetting store floors in key markets, emphasizes the performance DNA that Athleta is known for. We're really excited to welcome Chris Blakeslee to the team. As a proven leader in driving growth and innovation in the active apparel and wellness sector, most recently at Alo Yoga, we look forward to the work he and the team will drive to bring the Athleta brand to its full potential over the long term. Now turning to gross margin in the quarter. Gross margin was 37.6%, an increase of 310 basis points versus last year's reported gross margin. Compared to last year's adjusted rate, gross margin expanded 160 basis points due to merchandise margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points, which was slightly ahead of our expectations, partially offset by raw deleverage of 100 basis points. Drivers of the margin rate expansion were as follows: approximately 200 basis points of leverage as we lap last year's elevated airfreight and drove our normalized air expense down; approximately 200 basis points of leverage driven primarily from improved promotional activity relative to last year; approximately 140 basis points of deleverage related to inflationary cost headwinds, which was better than our prior expectations of approximately 200 basis points as we realized improved ocean freight rates; and ROD was flat on a nominal basis compared to last year but deleveraged 100 basis points due to the lower sales volume. Now let me turn to SG&amp;A. Reported SG&amp;A in the second quarter was $1.2 billion and included $13 million in restructuring charges related to our head count actions. On an adjusted basis, second quarter SG&amp;A declined 8% and leveraged 10 basis points versus last year driven mainly by lower advertising expense, payroll and technology investments. Reported operating income was $106 million. Adjusted operating income, which excludes restructuring charges, was $119 million in the second quarter. Adjusted operating margin improved 170 basis points from last year to 3.4% in the quarter driven by the 160 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 10 basis points of adjusted SG&amp;A leverage.During the second quarter, we recorded a benefit to both tax and net interest as a result of a transfer pricing settlement related to our sourcing activities. Reported EPS was $0.32. Adjusted EPS, which excludes restructuring charges, was $0.34. Share count ended at 369 million. Turning to balance sheet and cash flow, starting with inventory. Ending inventories declined 29% in second quarter versus last year. This includes a 9 percentage point decline related to in-transit as we lap the prior year supply chain challenges and 6 points of decline related to releasing the majority of our pack-and-hold inventory balance. The remaining 14-point decline was driven by more efficient inventory management. As you know, we made significant progress on reducing inventories as we exited fiscal 2022. We remain focused in fiscal 2023 on moderating buys and utilizing our responsive levers. As a result, we are planning for year-over-year inventory to be down generally in line with year-to-date trends at the end of third quarter.Quarter-end cash and equivalents were $1.4 billion, an increase of 91% from the prior year. Year-to-date net cash from operating activities was $528 million driven primarily by lower inventory levels. Capital expenditures were $199 million. We are pleased to have generated free cash flow of $329 million year-to-date. As we told you last quarter, we expect to be positioned to pay down the $350 million draw on our asset-backed line of credit this year. During the quarter, we paid down $200 million and intend to pay down the remaining $150 million balance by the end of the year. We remain committed to delivering an attractive quarterly dividend as a core component of total shareholder returns. During the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share. And on August 16, our Board approved maintaining that $0.15 dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Now turning to our outlook. We are all well aware of the mixed economic data and uncertain consumer trends in the marketplace, including the new dynamic regarding student loan repayments beginning in the third quarter. As a result, we continue to be prudent in our approach to planning in light of what remains an uncertain macro environment and choppy consumer backdrop. We now anticipate fiscal 2023 net sales, inclusive of the 53rd week, to be down generally in the mid-single-digit range compared to $15.6 billion in net sales last year and similar to our first half 2023 sales performance. The extra week is estimated to add approximately $150 million to fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 net sales. Specific to Q3 sales, we're encouraged by trend improvements as we exit second quarter and into August. However, we remain mindful of 2 important dynamics for the quarter: first, we are lapping tougher sales comparisons from last year; and second, as mentioned, we remain measured in our outlook. With these dynamics in mind, we are estimating third quarter net sales to be down in the low double-digit range compared to the $4.04 billion in net sales last year. Turning to gross margin. Starting with the full year compared to the 35% adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2022, gross margin expansion in fiscal 2023 is expected to be driven by the following factors: an estimated 200 basis points of leverage as we lap last year's elevated airfreight and continued to drive down normalized air expense; at least 100 basis points of margin benefit as a result of our better inventory position and expected improved promotional activity compared to last year; approximately 10 basis points of inflationary cost deleverage versus last year, as we look to the second half, we expect the inflationary deleverage in the first half of the year will shift to leverage in the back half as we benefit from both improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates; and ROD as a percentage of sales is now planned to deleverage roughly 70 basis points compared to last year. For the third quarter, we expect gross margin to be generally in line with last year's adjusted gross margin of 38.7%. We anticipate lower inflation and air costs, slightly below normalized levels, are expected to offset approximately 150 basis points of ROD deleverage, and we expect that promotional activity will be largely in line with last year. Turning to SG&amp;A. We now expect fiscal 2023 SG&amp;A of approximately $5.15 billion, below our prior outlook of $5.2 billion, primarily driven by variable expense flow-through on our narrowed fiscal 2023 sales. SG&amp;A in the third quarter is expected to be approximately $1.3 billion. We continue to expect capital expenditures of approximately $500 million to $525 million for the year. In closing, we're pleased to drive meaningful margin expansion and strong cash flow generation in the quarter and remain focused on delivering our fiscal 2023 outlook despite what continues to be a choppy consumer environment. I'm looking forward to working with Richard and the team as we unlock the value of our important and iconic brands and position Gap Inc. back on its path towards sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value for our shareholders over the long term. With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo maybe a two-part question. Richard, could you elaborate on the encouraging signs of progress that you see across the organization and maybe just as we think about opportunity for your concepts to take market share over time? And then Katrina, maybe just any way to elaborate on trends that you saw progress as the second quarter move forward and maybe what you're seeing today in terms of consumer behavior in August and into back-to-school.Richard DicksonWell, first off, thank you, Matthew, for the question. And I'll start with saying again how excited I am to be here on my third day. What I can tell you in the context of where we are, first and foremost, is that these brands are incredible assets, Gap, Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta, these are truly some of the most iconic brands in the fashion industry. We serve such a broad-based consumer, which is such a strength as well, generations and backgrounds. We've got incredible storied legacies, 54-year-old history. We created massive trends. When I look at the strength across the portfolio, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're the #1 specialty apparel company in America: the scale that we operate with, 600 million store visits, 1.4 billion online visits; the scaled operations we have from our DC network and logistics; our vendor partnerships, which can provide us incredible favorable rates and service; our production, we produced over 900 million units annually. The stats and strength of the fundamentals of this business are pretty incredible. Clearly, the transformation work that the team has done has put us on incredibly better financial footing. As Katrina mentioned, again, $1.4 billion in cash on hand in the balance sheet, $300 million of cash flow, 30% less inventory, these are metrics that matter and, ultimately, metrics that are incredibly encouraging in the context of our ability to build upon it and continue it and go forward. As I also mentioned, part two to the question in terms of where are the opportunity is, these are brands that truly matter. Now as I also said, they can matter more. And how to do that, I talk about reigniting the creative culture at Gap. We have extraordinary talent here. We are going to not only encourage the great talent to be unlocked in new and innovative ways, but we're also going to become a magnet for the industry's best talent. We are going to work very specifically, with intent, on creating distinctive brand purposes and, ultimately, really driving a consumer proposition that sets us apart from the competition and really leveraging, if you will, the art and science of this business, informed by consumer insights but, ultimately, really obsessing over the consumer. There's a lot of work ahead, but I'm incredibly encouraged, with 3 days in, around what we can offer and where we're going ahead. And obviously, in the days ahead, quarters ahead as well, we'll get more details. And I look forward to sharing that with you.Katrina O'ConnellThanks, Richard. And Matthew, I think on your other part of your question, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter in where in July, we definitely saw more improvement than we had seen sort of in May and June. I think that mirrored a lot of what apparel showed overall. And we've seen that improvement continue into August, which we're encouraged by. Overall, what we're seeing is that the women's business, particularly at Gap and Old Navy, has shown momentum shift. And kids and baby, as we're in the important back-to-school period, has also started off fairly well. So all of that is encouraging to see. And then, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're mindful, though, of the fact that we've seen the consumer still be pressured, especially at the low income range. And we're watchful of what I think is widely reported as the student loan repayment coming in the end of the quarter, which does primarily impact our Old Navy consumer.Matthew Robert BossThat's great color. Welcome aboard, Richard.Richard DicksonThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.Paul Lawrence LejuezRichard, you've been on the Board, so obviously, in touch with what's been going on operationally, to some extent. So I'm curious what you think might be the lowest-hanging fruit as you think about each of the brands. Also curious, a big organization, you talked about scale. Profitability doesn't quite match the efficiencies you would expect with such scale. So I'm curious what you think are the biggest inefficiencies of the company.Richard DicksonYes. Thanks, Paul. Look, broadly speaking, it's about really reigniting Gap Inc.'s culture to really empower creativity. In my experience on the Board and, certainly, on the ground for 3 days running fast, our teams are incredibly creative and they're all in on this. They're differentiating and strengthening our brands, being design-centric, being customer-obsessed and, ultimately, being culturally relevant. These are not necessarily new phrases and their common language, but these are the areas that we need to work upon and reignite and, ultimately, really think about how our brands show up in store, online, with consumer experiences that really excite and attract, drive demand and all of the variables that go into kind of balancing wants and needs. That, ultimately, is kind of where fashion lies. When I think about our brands in the context of opportunity, brands that have the kind of strength that we do, brands that matter, can be monetized. We need to make these brands matter more. And ultimately, that is going to be the pursuit. When I look at the strengths of the business, it is incredibly encouraging. That being said, we have work to do. We've started this transformation work under Bobby's leadership, and the team has worked tirelessly to make extraordinary progress. But we will continue not only the transformation that we've begun but we will start to build upon it and really unlock the value of these brands. We can all agree that there is greater value in the portfolio than is showing up in the stock today. And with the consistent performance that we expect, we're going to get rewarded for that. And ultimately, that's going to start with really driving demand, exciting our consumers and mattering more. And we'll be back very shortly to share how we're going to reveal all of that and continue moving forward.Paul Lawrence LejuezOkay. Can you just talk about what changed in your gross margin assumption for the back half of the year, which pieces moved as a result of what you've seen first half to date and what you're seeing thus far in the third quarter?Katrina O'ConnellYes, absolutely, Paul. So in second quarter, overall, the gross margin in total came in very close to -- I think the words we had used, to get you guys close to the margin we just delivered. There was a little bit of a shift between the inflationary pressure, which was better, came in at about 140 basis points of headwind. We had thought it would be closer to 200. And that was really because we saw rates in the freight area get better through some negotiations we just finished with some of our big suppliers and where we saw the margin get a little worse within ROD, where we deleveraged more since we came in at the lower end of our sales range in the quarter. So that dynamic plays through to the year where, again, the overall guide on the full year margin is basically intact. Air is still about 200 basis points of benefit, but we now see less impact from inflation, so only 10 basis points versus, what we had prior said, 50 basis points of headwind. And then the offset there is ROD where we now expect 70 basis points of deleverage whereas we had said somewhere between 0 and 50. So it's really this inflationary benefit offset by ROD deleverage, but overall, the nominal guide is very similar.Paul Lawrence LejuezAnd the promotional level is different than what you expected, you're softening your assumptions?Katrina O'ConnellWe came in very close in the second quarter to what we expected on promotions. And overall, we're holding the full year to about 100 basis points of overall leverage coming out of that promotional guide. And for the third quarter, what we said is we expect promotions to be about flat. So we'll see. Obviously, we came in with inventories down 29%; markdown inventory well under control. And the teams are excited to have chase capability back after the supply disruption that we experienced for so long. So we'll aspire to do better. But right now, that's what's embedded in the guide.Operator(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonWelcome, Richard. Katrina, maybe this is best for you. it looks like Old Navy has yet to inflect, though we are seeing some other value-oriented businesses pulling that off, it seems, in this quarter. So can you talk to me about what's going on there? Are you seeing any green shoots outside of women? I feel like we've had that maybe for a couple of quarters now. And then how do you think about the time line to improvement?Katrina O'ConnellYes, it's a great question, Alex. So when I look at what's been happening at Old Navy, I think what's been consistent is what we've been calling out, which is they do have a low-income consumer that remains pressured. And so that dynamic hasn't necessarily changed. When I look at what happened in Q2, though, lapping last year's significant clearance of active product, in particular, really weighed on the performance. If you remember last year, in Old Navy, we were in the process of really rightsizing the assortment away from cozy casual. We had a lot of the sizing issues. So lapping that has really weighed on the revenue side of things. As we move into the second half, we are seeing the active business improve modestly. Women's is getting better and kids is looking better as well. So we'll see where that all lands us. But yes, we are seeing green shoots at Old Navy. I think all of those categories we aspire to have getting better. Again, the consumer pressure is most acute at Old Navy, and that's the piece that I think we all remain cautious on. Whether it's the low-income consumer starting to get real wage pressure from inflation or whether it's the new student loan dynamic, we'll see how that plays out for Old Navy.OperatorOur next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.Lorraine Corrine Maikis HutchinsonKatrina, as you think about the mid-single-digit decline in sales guidance for the year, it does imply a nice improvement in fourth quarter, can you just talk about how you've been thinking about that improvement? What drives it outside of the 53rd week, of course, and how you're getting comfortable with that level of improvement from here?Katrina O'ConnellYes. So Lorraine, you're correct that the fourth quarter does have some benefit from the 53rd week. But in addition to that, I know we're all tired of looking back at 2019, but I just sort of look at the run rate in the business from the first half to the back half versus 2019, and the quarters, Q3 and Q4, are very similar to what we just sort of went through. So I think there's a lot of quarterly variation that we have seen over the last couple of years. Fourth quarter, when you look back to 2019, looks more similar to history.OperatorOur next question comes from Jonna Kim with TD Cowen.Jungwon KimJust a question on Athleta, sort of how you're thinking about turning around the brand and getting the brand back from growth over time and just be competitive in the market?Katrina O'ConnellYes, I'll take that. And I mean, Richard, of course, I welcome your view as well, but maybe I'll start, and then you can say a little bit more. As I said in my prepared remarks, we feel really good about Athleta's positioning in the marketplace. The power of she positioning is incredibly strong. And we feel like we have a lot of white space in that brand to win. We knew we had some near-term product execution issues, which the team, as I said, has been heads down working on. For fall, there's not a lot of change to the product that the teams have been able to do, but they've been remerchandising the stores and the site and, hopefully, if you're a consumer, you see that it looks much more in line with the brand aesthetic. And then we are excited to welcome a few new players to the team, whether it's Chris or Julia, who we think will also bring their experience to bear on the brand starting in fourth quarter and then really into next year. So we're very excited about Athleta's potential long term, and we know we're just sort of going to get through the next quarter or 2 as we make the changes we can to the assortment we have. But Richard, I'll let you add if there's something else.Richard DicksonYes. Thanks, Katrina. As a member of the Board, I had a chance to get to know Chris and help select him for this role. He's an exceptional talent, broad-based experience across the apparel retail and wholesale industries, holding roles across multiple functions. As the recent President of Alo Yoga, he was really able to successfully and quickly grow that brand, nearly doubling its year-over-year growth, and with extraordinary expertise in performance apparel. So as Katrina called out, we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the team that Chris is leading and their recent efforts, and we're really looking forward to the accelerated progress that we intend on making with this brand.OperatorOur next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.Robert Scott DrbulI guess, Richard, for you, when you look at the -- you talked about Chris. But when you look at the team that you have in place, having been on the Board, I think you understand their vision. Should we assume there are no further management changes necessary at a very senior level as you look at the portfolio?Richard DicksonYes. Thanks, Bob, for the question. I've been on the Board since last year when much of the work began taking root and I feel I could really hit the ground running. That said, it's early. I'm focused on listening and learning. We really do have a very strong team. I only see it getting stronger. So in the context of, let's call it, Board tenure and now, obviously, 3 days in, from what I feel and see in the context of being on the ground, I'm very encouraged. The work that the team has done around the transformation has really toiled the soil, if you will, in the context of my entrance and really feel like the baton being handed is strong. So with that said, we'll share a lot more in the coming quarters around where we're headed, how we're going to get there and, ultimately, much more detail associated with it, but early days, I'm very encouraged.Robert Scott DrbulGreat. And Katrina, if I could just sneak a second one in for you. In terms -- you made some progress on the SG&amp;A. I know there's been some discussion around potential for further cuts. Is there any sort of further idea on additional opportunities as you look at the SG&amp;A line going forward?Katrina O'ConnellYes. It's a good question, Bob. I mean, when we look at the work we've done, we've impacted about $550 million of cost in the business, whether it's the actions we took early last fall that have helped offset some of the inflationary pressure this year or whether it's the overhead actions we just took that we think will generate $300 million cost. So I think you've heard both Bobby and Richard say that we're happy with a lot of this work we've done to set the foundation. The remaining SG&amp;A work, I think, is to be seen. A lot of it is on some of the demand-generating investments we've made, marketing and technology, where I think Richard and I will really partner on assessing whether we think those are adding the value that we think they need to add or whether there are some refinements we can make there. And that's the next leg of the journey, for us to see how we would, if we would, really moderate those in the next coming quarters. So more to come, but those are the areas, I think, consistent with what we've been saying that we would look at.OperatorOur next question comes from Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies.Corey TarloweWelcome, Richard. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about how you're rethinking about how the brands show up in-stores and online. So I'd just be curious to kind of get your thoughts, and again, having been on the Board since November, your thoughts around kind of the store fleet and how to profitably leverage the store fleet to drive further sales ahead. And then just Katrina, just wanted to get your thoughts around, and apologies if I missed it, on promotions in the second half of this year.Richard DicksonThanks, Corey. There's a lot in my opening remarks, and we can double-click on many of them. But in the context of the areas that I see the most opportunities, it's specific to really working on this distinctive brand purpose that aligns with our customer values and really sets them apart. As I talk about the brands and their legacies, I really -- these are brands that matter. And when you have brands that matter, they could be monetized. That being said, you have to make these brands matter more. That has to have great product, great marketing, great execution, and we really need to understand and be obsessed with our customer. I think that we have elements of it, but where we're going to really work very, very diligently on is creating meaningful differences in the context of our brands and making these brands matter more. When you look at our stores, they need to reflect, if you will, the right narrative in the context of product statements that we believe are heroic, products that we believe will matter to our consumers, the right balance between basics and fashion, and an experience where details really come across to create an experience that consumers will talk about, want to return to and ultimately find, if you will, the value and quality and product experiences that are required today for brands that win. And that's what you're going to see us work much more diligently on. As transformations go, these things take time. But we will start to test and roll and really learn essentially what works and what doesn't in a more accelerated way so that we could do more of what works and do less of what doesn't. Lots more to come with lots more examples, and we'll share those as they evolve.Katrina O'ConnellYes. It's great, Richard. And I think, Corey, to answer your second question, we did see successful expansion of gross margin with lower promotional levels in the second quarter. So we saw about 200 basis points of margin expansion coming from lower discounting in the second quarter. Right now, in our outlook, we have basically a flat level of promotional activity in Q3. So as we talked about, we'll aspire to do better with the lower inventory levels and chase that we have. But we remain cautious on the consumer, and so we definitely want to make sure that we're offering enough value to the consumer heading into the third quarter. So we'll see where that lands.OperatorOur next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantRichard, this is sort of a more philosophical question given you've only been there 3 days -- a year and then 3 days. So your tenure at Mattel was sort of similar in concept, sort of reinvigorate the core brands, restore growth and restore the position sort of as an industry leader. So I guess my question is, oftentimes, when you have a company that's been struggling, the creative team and all those assets get very safe, right, so they become very risk averse. And I'm just wondering, how do you create a culture of greater risk-taking and innovation such that, that creativity can kind of come to the forefront?Richard DicksonYes. Thank you for that question. It's a great question. There are a lot of parallels with my experience at Mattel and Gap Inc.'s business across many levels. And I'm here to architect and orchestrate; ultimately, to lead. And the parallel construction of where Mattel was and where Gap is, is very familiar: great assets, great talent; a moment where, to some extent, a lot of self-inflicted challenges, some within our control and some, ultimately, impacting our business and our industry; and ultimately, a phase that we are going to go through, which is really about unlocking the value of our brands through reigniting a creative culture. The balance of fundamental and/or fiscal responsibility and operational rigor, while you are driving a design-centric and creative culture, is the art and science of the leadership that you need to have in this business. It is a very familiar language. It's actually a very familiar model. And ultimately, you've got to be able to take swings that are calculated. Test, role, learn and scale and accelerate very, very quickly. That is a muscle that we will begin to exercise and strengthen. With the experience that I bring in the context of that type of leadership, I believe that that's going to add value very, very quickly. This is an organization that is really excited to unlock and reignite, if you will, creativity. And so I feel incredibly fortunate to be inheriting a business that, from a transformational perspective, has come through, if you will, a very heavy lift and is now delivering, if you will, a fertile ground for a design-led culture, creativity that, ultimately, will show up for consumers and the ability for us to make brands that matter, matter more.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantThat's super helpful. Katrina, one quick one. Sorry, did you talk about shrink? When do you take your physicals? I think it's midyear, but I may be wrong. And is there anything to call out there of note?Katrina O'ConnellYes. Thanks, Adrienne. There's nothing notable to call out from us on shrink. We do full counts once a year, in the early part of the year, first quarter. We do, do partials in the second half of the year. And as of now, our shrink remains below pre-pandemic levels, and there's really nothing to call out. So shrink is, so far for us, not anything of note.Adrienne Eugenia Yih-TennantOkay. Best of luck, and welcome.Richard DicksonThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group.Dana Lauren TelseyWelcome, Richard. Just following up, Richard, in terms of some of the thoughts to what you've done in the past. I've read some of the articles about how you put together the thoughts on brand relevance of 4 points: why do we exist, design-led innovation, culturally relevant and execute with excellence. How do you look at those initiatives or those topics in comparison to Gap and your initial thoughts on reinventing and rearchitecting the business model in any way. And then, Katrina, I just wanted to follow up on, as you think about 2024 and planning, how are you thinking about inventories for the back half of the year and into next year?Richard DicksonDana, thank you for the study of my background and playbook at Mattel. My experience in turning brands around and accelerating performance, it goes beyond the development of a playbook but really rallying teams to deliver on a plan, ensuring operational rigor and enabling a culture to execute with excellence. In the context of that methodology, when you look at Gap brands, these are beloved brands. They have a real connection with consumers, and we need to reignite that connection. I'm passionate about motivating teams to uncover what made a brand or a company iconic and special in the first place and then working together to reinvigorate them to new relevance. So the familiarities in the context of the work and legacy brands revitalization methodologies are familiar and similar. That being said, the playbook that we will reveal, that will be the strength and the consideration set to reignite the Gap portfolio, will be one that we've collectively work on as a team as I listen, learn, spend time with our stores, our headquarters, DCs, partners and really start to understand, ultimately, what will be the Gap playbook that will deliver, ultimately, to our consumers, our people and our shareholders, and we'll be back shortly to be able to share all of that.Katrina O'ConnellAnd then, Dana, on inventory, we do expect that third quarter ending inventory will be very similar to the first half trends. And overall, more to come as we head into next year, but we expect to be running more and more on leaner inventory with receipts left open so that we can be more responsive to consumer demand closer in. And a lot of the transformational activity that we're working on is not only just reinstating the responsive levers that we've had but working closer with our vendor base to make sure that we have the right materials, the right logic with our vendors, to be closer to the consumer. So all of that helps us have leaner inventories and be more dynamic. So more to come on what those levers are going forward.OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachWelcome, Richard. I wanted to follow up on Old Navy. Can you elaborate on the competitive backdrop that you're seeing in the business today, particularly as Old Navy competes for that value-oriented customer who has options, both online and with other discounters. And are you seeing any benefits from a trade-down customer in your stores?Katrina O'ConnellYes, Brooke, I mean what we're seeing is that some of the brands that are really winning with our consumer are T.J. Maxx, Amazon, Shein, we're definitely seeing those businesses gaining share. And those compete with our customer. We're also seeing strong brands like Nike and Lulu and Adidas win, which tells us that great brands win in any economic environment. Old Navy has the benefit of being the #2 brand behind Nike. And so it is a big player in the branded space as well as being a retailer. So I'm thrilled to have Richard onboard with his experience in creating relevant brands. And that brand already has such a strong positioning. I think we have a lot to do there to keep winning in that space. So more to come there, but we're glad with their positioning, for sure. On trade-down benefit, we're not currently seeing any trade-down benefit. That said, we're certainly positioned to add value to any consumer as we move forward since our goal is to have great fashion at a great value, but we're not seeing that yet.Brooke Siler RoachIf I could just follow up on one other topic, we've heard a number of companies this week address credit and card portfolios amidst some of the macro concerns that we're seeing in the environment broadly. Can you provide a brief update on how you're planning your credit business and what might be planned in your outlook for the rest of the year?Katrina O'ConnellYes, it's a good question, Brooke, and certainly, we're watching that, too. So any trends in credit card income that we see from industry reports or see within our own business are currently reflected in the outlook we provided today. We do see, same as the industry reports, loss rates increasing from the recent lows in '21 and '22. However, ours are not back to pre-pandemic levels yet. And we're working with our credit card provider to adjust our underwriting strategies to make sure we're mitigating risk of higher delinquencies while still providing our customers with flexibility. So we're actively monitoring the consumer environment. We're watching the impact to credit and all of the trends on the credit card customer, again, are in the outlook we just provided.Brooke Siler RoachGreat. Best of luck.Katrina O'ConnellThanks, Brooke.OperatorThank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call over to Richard Dickson for closing remarks.Richard DicksonThank you. I'd like to thank all of you for your time, your interest and your questions. And I just want to reiterate my belief in Gap Inc., our people, our brands and how truly thrilled I am to be the CEO of this extraordinary company. I also just want to thank the people of Gap Inc. for this incredibly warm welcome and to thank Bobby, in particular, for his tireless leadership over the past year and for igniting transformative work that I really am eager to pick up and run with. And all of you who joined the call today, I look forward to meeting all of you in the coming weeks and months, and thank you all for joining.OperatorThank you. That does conclude our conference call.

Never be left in the dust again.Nvidia's blazing quarterNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) obliterated Wall Street expectations for Q2 and full-year revenue guidance as demand for its chips remains sky-high amid the race to adopt generative artificial intelligence.Shares climbed as high as 6.6% to $502.66 in Thursday's regular session after the post-close Wednesday print - an all-time high for Nvidia - although the stock retreated to a marginal gain at $471.63 by the end of the day.The chipmaker recorded earnings of $2.70 per share, $0.67 better than consensus, on revenue of $13.51 billion vs. the $11.13B average analyst estimate. Embedded in the sales number was a 171% surge in its high-margin data center business as businesses transition to accelerated computing and generative AI from general-purpose computing.The chipmaker also unveiled an additional $25B stock buyback plan.As AI demand ramps up, Nvidia's suite of AI-related products has become the dominant option for AI-minded startups and businesses. The chipmaker said it expects supply to rise each quarter through next year, and in particular expects Q3 sales of about $16B, give or take 2%, well above the $12B consensus.That ebullient guidance, said Wedbush in a note to clients, ""will be fuel in the engine to ignite a tech rally we see continuing into the rest of the year despite the recent pullback and Fed jitters.""Stifel upgraded Nvidia to Buy from Hold with a price target of $600 on the ""exceptional"" quarter, saying, ""we underestimated the opportunity related to the potential shift of $1 trillion of installed data center infrastructure from general purpose compute to accelerated compute architectures.""Story continuesMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs maintained their buy ratings on the stock, with the former calling Q2 ""another exceptional quarter"" and Goldman writing, ""We expect Nvidia to maintain its status as the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future.""And a notable Nvidia bull at Rosenblatt hiked the price target to an eye-popping $1,100 per share, opining, ""Nvidia’s epic print and guide two quarters in a row is simply unprecedented and just getting started.""Marvell Technology's dull printElsewhere in tech, investors were deflated when Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) posted merely in-line guidance and a slightly better-than-expected fiscal Q2.Shares were down some 5% in Friday's premarket following the post-bell Thursday print, extending on a nearly 7% slide in the prior regular session.Q2 earnings came in at $0.33 per share, a penny better than consensus, and revenue of $1.34B - down 12% from a year earlier - was a hair above the $1.33B Street estimate. For fiscal Q3, Marvell anticipates earnings of $0.40 per share on $1.4B in revenue.CEO Matt Murphy said the growth implied in those expectations ""is being driven primarily by AI and cloud infrastructure.""Snowflake falls despite a big earnings beatCloud concern Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW), meanwhile, reported earnings of $0.22 per share after the bell Wednesday, more than double the average Street estimate, on far better-than-expected sales of $674 million - up 36% year-over-year.The company also maintained full-year guidance.BTIG said Snowflake's results were solid and that its ""long-term story is compelling on multiple levels,"" but maintained its Neutral rating on the stock, saying it sees ""a balanced risk/reward"" at current levels.Shares foundered Thursday, losing 5.2% to $147.67.Zoom ahead on earnings; shares take a dipFinally, after the bell Monday, video-chat purveyor Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) said it earned $1.34 per share in its fiscal Q2, well ahead of the $1.06 average estimate, on better-than-expected sales of $1.14.Fiscal Q3 EPS guidance of $1.07 to $1.09 was ahead of the $1.03 consensus, and sales are expected at an in-line $1.115B to $1.12B.Needham &amp; Company maintained its Hold rating on the stock, writing, ""we are cautious on meaningful re-acceleration until product diversification improves.""Zoom shares were down more than 2% Tuesday.Ulta, Gap, and Nordstrom deliver better-than-anticipated profitsUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) beat on its Q2 print and full-year guidance after the bell Thursday: EPS totaled $6.02 on $2.53B in sales, whereas analysts were looking for $5.83 per share on $2.5B, while comparable-store sales climbed 8% - a slowdown from 14.4% the prior year. And the full-year profit forecast comes to $25.10 to $25.60 per share on $11.05B to $11.15B, with comps expected to rise 4.5% to 5.5%.Ulta shares were up 1.3% to $428.08 premarket Friday.Also up in Friday's premarket were Gap (NYSE:GPS) shares, which were recently climbing 1.4% to $9.66 after the casual-clothing retailer said Q2 adjusted earnings totaled $0.34 per share, $0.25 better than consensus, on a slightly lower-than-expected top line of $3.55B. Comparable store sales were down 6% over its brands, including Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta, and Q3 sales are seen down in the low double-digits range.Finally, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) reiterated its full-year guidance Thursday and reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.81, crushing the $0.45 average Street target, on better-than-expected revenue of $3.77B. Still, sales suffered a 275-basis-point hit from its wind-down of Canadian operations, as well as a 12.9% fall in online sales due to elimination of store fulfillment for Nordstrom Rack digital orders in the prior year and the closing down of Trunk Club.Nordstrom shares were ticking down fractionally to $16.75 in recent premarket trading Friday.(Yasin Ebrahim, Davit Kirakosyan, Liz Moyer, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.)Related Articles5 big earnings hits: Nvidia's bang-up Q2; retail's bottom-line beatsFactbox-Companies sell their businesses in RussiaAffirm surges amid growth in customer transaction volumes]"

With the consensus EPS estimate being $0.09, the EPS surprise was +277.78%.While investors closely watch year-over-year changes in headline numbers -- revenue and earnings -- and how they compare to Wall Street expectations to determine their next course of action, some key metrics always provide a better insight into a company's underlying performance.Since these metrics play a crucial role in driving the top- and bottom-line numbers, comparing them with the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated about them helps investors better project a stock's price performance.Here is how Gap performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:Comparable Store Sales - Old Navy - YoY change: -6% versus -4.03% estimated by five analysts on average.Comparable store sales - YoY change: -6% compared to the -4.07% average estimate based on five analysts.Comparable store sales - Banana Republic - YoY change: -8% versus -6.44% estimated by five analysts on average.Comparable Store Sales - Gap - YoY change: -1% versus -0.61% estimated by five analysts on average.Number of Store Locations - Gap - Total: 621 compared to the 651.25 average estimate based on four analysts.Number of Store Locations - Banana Republic - Total: 455 compared to the 454 average estimate based on four analysts.Number of Store Locations - Old Navy North America: 1247 versus 1253.25 estimated by four analysts on average.Number of Store Locations - Company-operated stores: 2592 compared to the 2618.5 average estimate based on four analysts.Square Footage - Banana Republic North America: 3.4 Msq ft versus 3.48 Msq ft estimated by three analysts on average.Net Sales- Gap Global- Total: $755 million versus the four-analyst average estimate of $816.92 million.

The August washout appears to want to continue; there were no major news events that would reasonably expect the Dow to plummet -330 points, -0.96% — and it was the winner of the main indices. The S&amp;P 500 fell -1.36% on the day, and the Nasdaq, early today buoyed by NVIDIA’s NVDA big earnings performance yesterday after the close, sank -1.88% on the day. The small-cap Russell 2000 was down -1.27%.Basically, we’ve just kissed those big gains from June and July goodbye. This is obviously bad news for short-term stock traders, but ultimately might provide a silver lining for longer-term investors: those mid-July highs were getting pretty “nose-bleed,” and pulling back — as many analysts had been looking for — looks to be setting the table for a higher-volume late summer/early fall trading environment with room to move higher. Or so goes the hopeful side of things.We would be wise to wait for Fed Chair Jay Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium tomorrow, his first major address since the last FOMC meeting, which brought about its fourth-straight 25 basis-point (bps) hike to the highest Fed funds rate since 2001. How warm will he be to the idea of further rate hikes in the near-term? Powell is never preoccupied with satisfying the immediate wants of stock market participants, but if he feels the need to reassure that the current 5.25-5.50% ought to take care of inflation meaningfully over time, perhaps he’ll throw us all a bone in the final days of a tough trading month.Nordstrom JWN posted a strong Q2 earnings beat after today’s close: earnings of 84 cents per share surged ahead of the 45 cents expected (and beating the year-ago 81 cents per share, as well) on revenues of $3.77 billion topped the $3.67 billion in the Zacks consensus. This is the seventh straight earnings beat for the company, even though we see lower results for its flagship stores and Nordstrom Rack discount stores. Shares initially jumped but are now flat on the news, as the company did not raise guidance after such a boffo earnings surprise.Gap Stores GPS also reported Q2 results after the closing bell, with a giant beat on the bottom line — earnings of 34 cents per share versus expectations of 9 cents — augmented by a slight miss on the top: $3.55 billion in quarterly sales, as opposed to the $3.60 billion analysts were expecting. Comps fell -6% year over year, which was worse than the -4% expected, while its Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and flagship Gap stores all came in lower than year-ago numbers. Shares are -5% in late trading.Specialty retailer Ulta Beauty ULTA outpaced expectations on both top and bottom lines in its Q2 report this afternoon, with earnings of $6.02 per share nicely improving over the $5.87 anticipated and revenues of $2.53 billion in the quarter ahead of the $2.51 billion. The company also raised Q3 comps guidance, after seeing +8% gains year over year in today’s release. Interestingly, Ulta is one of the few major retailers having recently reported with positive Inventory growth of +9%; the company credited high demand for the gains in supply. Shares are up +2% in after-market trading.Questions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here&gt;&gt;Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(GPS) and Nordstrom (JWN) reported their quarterly results after the market close on Thursday. Gap's results were mixed, with adjusted earnings beating estimates, but revenue falling short. Nordstrom beat on both the top and bottom lines. Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the results.Gap has a new CEO at the helm, former Mattel executive Richard Dickson. Swartz says Dickson ""has a lot of work to do. These sales numbers for Gap are quite poor."" Swartz notes that Gap has done a lot of cost cutting, which is helping the bottom line, but ""all of Gap's concepts are really struggling with the top line."" Swartz says Dickson should focus on fixing Old Navy and Athleta first because they have the most potential.On Nordstrom, Swartz says overall, sales were better than expected, but that's more because expectations were so low. Swartz also notes that, like Gap, Nordstrom has been cutting expenses, but more top-line growth is needed. On Nordstrom's off-price unit Rack, Swartz says the problem is that ""Nordstrom doesn't seem to know what to do with it. It seems like every quarter we hear a different story about what Rack's place is in discount retail and its place at Nordstrom.""Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Watching shares of Gap at Nordstrom. Both retailers out with their second quarter results. Shares of both companies actually moving to the upside here in extended trading. Gap up just about 3%. We want to bring in Morningstar equity analyst David Swartz. And David, real quick, let's just recap the numbers that we got here. So Gap sales missed. Total comp sales coming in worse than expected to drop of 6%. Same-store sales, they're dropping across all four brands.And then you also take a look at Nordstrom, a bit of a different picture there. Better-than-expected earnings, revenue, same-store sales were also higher than what the Street was looking for. We are starting to see some strength in Racks off price store. The decline there smaller than what the Street was looking for. David, though, let's start with Gap, since that was really the focal point after-hours here. We have a new CEO at the helm. What do you think of this report and how this sets up the new CEO Richard Dickson here as he tries to get Gap back on the right track?Story continuesDAVID SWARTZ: He definitely has a lot of work to do. These sales numbers for Gap are quite poor. It looks like the EPS was above expectations due to lower costs. Gap has done a lot of cost-cutting, a lot of layoffs. And that is helping the bottom line. But the reality is that all of Gap's concepts are really struggling with the top line. And a negative 6% comp for Old Navy is really bad. And unfortunately, Old Navy has been reporting negative same-store sales numbers now for the last couple of years. And it doesn't seem to be getting much better. So the new CEO comes in from Mattel certainly has a lot of work to do there.AKIKO FUJITA: Where does he start? I mean, we just showed those numbers across all the brands that Gap has. What do you prioritize? Because all these brands have struggled.DAVID SWARTZ: The priorities have to be Old Navy and Athleta, because those really have the most potential. Old Navy should be doing a lot better than it is. In the press release, Gap called out poor activewear sales at Old Navy. And it's just really hard to understand, because activewear has slowed down, but it's still a relatively strong category. And since Old Navy sells a lot of really basic stuff at low prices, it should be doing a lot better in this economy.And then if you look at Athleta, it does have potential, because women's athleisure is still a very hot area. But Athleta has been underperforming a lot of other retailers that sell women's activewear, certainly Lululemon, but others, too, like Free People Movement, which is owned by Urban Outfitters. Those really have to be the two main priorities for the company.SEANA SMITH: David, what does the timeline look like for this turnaround? We talk about what he needs to do to revive it. How long is something like that potentially going to take?DAVID SWARTZ: Well, it's already taken years. That's the reality. And unfortunately, I don't know if Gap can really wait long time for some of these new things to happen. Gap hasn't really been standing still now. It was without a CEO for an entire year. But the board did make some changes. And I mentioned the layoffs, they have a new person in charge of Old Navy now. He was brought in last year.So they have made some moves. Hopefully, those will start to show some payoff soon. In the meantime, unfortunately, it's really just [AUDIO OUT] to try to stabilize the earnings. But the new CEO Dickson, he has a background in apparel. And he comes from Mattel, where he had success with Barbie. He is certainly going to have to implement something new at Old Navy and Athleta especially to get them back on track.AKIKO FUJITA: Now, David, let's talk about what we got from Nordstrom. You know, on the one hand, maybe better than expected. But sales in the department store are still below pre-pandemic levels. You look at where Nordstrom Rack is, that also saw a decline, although not as much as the Street expected. And what does it tell you about the mix that Nordstrom has right now? Is it about inventory? Is it about pricing? What are they not quite getting right?DAVID SWARTZ: Nordstrom certainly does have merchandising problems. It can't seem to do very well with Gap and the full-line stores the same time. It seems like one of them is always struggling. In this court, it looks like Rack had a better quarter than expected. But the Nordstrom full-size stores did not have a great number at all.The overall sales were a little bit better than expected. But it's really just because expectations are so low, because Nordstrom has been struggling. As with Gap, Nordstrom has been cutting expenses. They did show some improvement in the gross margin in this quarter, which does bode well perhaps for better profitability. But again, like Gap, there really needs to be top line growth at Nordstrom. And we haven't been getting that recently even with the anniversary sale coming in July this year.SEANA SMITH: David, why do you think Rack has been doing well, especially given this environment? You would think even people at the higher end of the spectrum are starting to trade down. They're looking for those deals. You would think it would set up Rack to have a better quarter than another quarter of sales declines.DAVID SWARTZ: I think the big problem with Rack is that Nordstrom doesn't seem to know what to do with it. It seems like every quarter, we hear a different story about what Rack's place is in discount retail and its place at Nordstrom. At one time, Nordstrom talked about having higher-priced merchandise at Gap-- I mean, at Rack. Other times, they've said we should have lower priced merchandise at Rack. So it's kind of all over the place.It seems like the company doesn't really know what to do with it. It certainly should be performing better. And Nordstrom continues to open a lot of Rack stores. So Nordstrom certainly believes it's going to turn around soon. We haven't seen it so much in the numbers, but this quarter was a little bit better, it looks like.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. I think they have nine stores new stores since the start of the year. All right. David Swartz of Morningstar, thanks.]"

The company also saw a drop in comparable sales across all four brands. Nordstrom (JWN) shares are trading in the red despite beating expectations on adjusted earnings, revenue, and same-store sales in its second quarter. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares fall as the company's second quarter results barely beat estimates on adjusted earnings and revenue. Ulta (ULTA) shares are trading in the green after the company boosted its earnings and comp sales forecast for the year. Yahoo Finance's Seana Smith takes a look at some of the stocks moving in after-hours trading.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at a couple of names that are trending after-hours. We've got four stocks for you. Let's start off with GAP. We're looking at gains of just about 7/10 of a percent, not a huge move here in extended trading. It's actually a bit surprising, given the results that we just got from GAP. The company reporting a larger-than-expected drop in same-store sales. Revenue also missing expectations. Total comp sales declining 6%, which was worse than expected. All four brands for the company posting a decline in same-store sales from a year ago.They have the new CEO, Richard Dickson. He is going to be on the call this afternoon, certainly has a tough time-- a tough couple of months ahead as he looks to right the retailer. But shares of GAP, again, moving-- let's take a look at GAP, not Dow. Shares of GAP up just about 25% over the last three months. Year-to-date, though, we're still looking at declines of about 15%.Moving on to Nordstrom, another reading here on the retail sector. Better-than-expected earnings, revenue, and same-store sales, yet we're still seeing declines when we take a look at some of the numbers that we're getting. Rack was one of the bright spots, I guess, you could call it that, in this report. The decline in sales wasn't as bad as what the Street was anticipating. Rack posting a sales drop of just about 4.1% for the quarter. That's an improvement from an 11% drop the previous quarter.Story continuesYear-to-date, Nordstrom barely in the green, up just about 4%. When you take a look at the movement over the last three months, pretty similar here on that performance. Lots of questions about what the future looks like for Nordstrom and where the company should focus as it tries to get more consumers through its stores.And Marvell Technology, another read on AI and the excitement that we're seeing there. Certainly, a lot was riding on this report. We're looking at losses of just about 3%. Now, the company's adjusted EPS beat the Street's expectations. Net revenue also topped what the Street was looking for at $134 billion. But it was a decline of about 12% year-over-year. Data set and revenue was off 29% year-over-year. There's certainly been a lot of growing optimism within Marvell because of their AI exposure. Year-to-date, we're looking at gains of just about 54%.And rounding it out with Ulta, another reading on the consumer. Year-to-date drop of nearly 10%. After-hours, though, we're looking at a gain of just about 2%. The company boosting its earnings forecast for the year as well as its comp sales forecast. They're expecting growth of 4 and 1/2% to 5 and 1/2%. So consumers are still spending a bit when it comes to beauty. Year-to-date, though, like I said, shares are still in the red.]"

If you want to skip our introduction to one of the most historic stock indexes in America, then head on over to 5 Most Undervalued Dow Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the oldest stock indexes in the world. It was set up in 1896 and holds a central place in the history of the stock market as a result. This also lends the index a special status where the stocks that are included in it are called blue chip stocks, which alludes to their high value and overall stability.Stocks included in the Dow index do not stay there forever. The index in its current form which is limited to 30 stocks came into being in 1928 when it was expanded to reflect the roaring market conditions of the time. This time period was one of the most prosperous in the early history of the Dow index, as 1928 marked an eight year bull run that had started in 1920. It started after the end of the first world war which had left an economic recession in the United States and it would end with much worse economic circumstances coming in as the Great Depression would start. In terms of percentage point drops in economic activity, the Great Depression would be fifteen times as bad as the contraction during the Great Recession after the economic crisis in 2008. Like the housing crisis, the Great Depression also began in the U.S. and then spread all over the world, with stocks believed to have lost more than three quarters of value during the time period.After the Great Depression, the next period of turbulence in the Dow would come during the 1970s when the U.S. shifted away from gold and Saudi Arabia led an oil embargo that led to severe inflation all across America along with dropping economic growth as the pumps dried up. The stock market, which as a whole relies on economic growth and prosperity, does not like any turbulence in either the oil supply or the economy, and as a result, the Dow did poorly. The index would continue to withstand turmoil during the next couple of decades, and with the turn of the millennium, it would lag the losses of the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P500 during the time when the devastating September 11 attacks shook markets.Story continuesThe index's history has also seen several companies come and go. The longest running component of the Dow index is believed to be General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). General Electric is one of the oldest companies in America, and it was part of the original Dow index of 1896. Keeping its place in the list of elite stocks for 122 years, the firm exited the Dow in 2018. True to its name the ""Dow Jones 'Industrial' Average,"" most of the original constituents of the Dow were industrial companies. However, its reshaping has been influenced by trends in the broader U.S. economy, with the latest additions being some of the most consequential firms of today such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The chairman and managing director of the Dow Indices index's committee Mr. David Blitzer was cognizant of the evolutionary dynamics in the stock market at the time of GE's de-listing, as he commented:Since then [1907] the U.S. economy has changed: consumer, finance, health care and technology companies are more prominent today and the relative importance of industrial companies is less.Right now, five out of the 30 stocks in the Dow index are information technology firms, making it the largest sector in the index. After tech, the largest sector in the index is financial services, and together, the pair represent nine out of the 30 companies in the Dow. Currently, the oldest member of the index is The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which was added in 1932 and the three youngest additions are Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). According to S&amp;P Dow Jones, the change was prompted after Apple split its shares four to one, which ended up affecting the index's weights.Taking stock of the Dow's performance this year, the index has gained a modest 2.91%, which reflects the mixed performance in the U.S. economy. While technology stocks have soared, other areas such as regional banking and real estate haven't fared so well.

If you want to skip our introduction to the technology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then check out 5 Most Profitable Tech Stocks in 2023. August 2023 is a crucial month as the stock market pours over the countless earnings reports for the second calendar quarter. The first half of the year saw mega technology cap stocks soar to record high levels, fueled by heightened optimism and expectations about artificial intelligence. At the same time, the fresh earnings report allowed investors and analysts to gauge the impact of the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate hikes on corporate operations, and the dropping inflation's effects on revenues and consumer spending power.The first two technology giants to report earnings this season were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both, like some of their other peers, are at the top of the recent AI wave. Meta, which owns Facebook, is expected to significantly benefit from artificial intelligence when it comes to providing users with advertisements and content recommendations based on their previous Facebook use and preferences in general. Facebook also announced a new artificial intelligence model in August through which it aims to enable users who speak different languages to communicate with each other.On the earnings front, Meta reported $2.98 in adjusted earnings per share which marked a 16% annual growth. Revenue for the firm stood at $31.9 billion after growing by 11% annually. The earnings report also provided details about Meta's costly bet on the metaverse which not only saw the firm plow billions of dollars into the technology last year but also change its name to reflect the change. This bet came at the wrong time as far as the stock market was concerned, as investors were looking for cost cutting at a time of high interest rates and high inflation. This led to Meta's shares being one of the worst performing stocks in 2022, but the shares have roared back to life this year as they are up by 136% year to date.Story continuesMicrosoft, which is another firm at the heart of the AI wave, grew its revenue by 8% annually as it reported $56.2 billion in net sales. However, the firm's guidance for the current quarter failed to impress investors and its shares slipped on the stock market as a result. Alphabet's results were far more impressive than Microsoft's as the firm beat analyst revenue estimates and posted $74.6 billion in revenue to mark a 7% annual growth.Finally, the remaining two tech titans, namely Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) showed a mixed bag of results that reflected the current economic turmoil and uncertainty. Starting off with Apple, the largest technology company in the world relied on its services segment to beat top and bottom line analyst estimates. However, Apple, which relies on high end, premium products to earn its keep, saw its revenue drop by 1% annually with its hardware segment leading the drop as consumers felt a pinch to their purchasing power. Amazon, on the other hand, roared on the same day that Apple sounded a bit meek, as it beat analyst estimates for both revenue and net income and also surpassed the guidance estimates for the current quarter.As to why Amazon managed to thrive in a tough consumer economy, here's what the firm's management had to say during the earnings call for the quarter:Central to our efforts has been the decision to transition our stores’ fulfillment and transportation network from one national network in the United States to a series of eight separate regions serving smaller geographic areas. We keep a broad selection of inventory in each region, making it faster and less expensive to get those products to customers. Regionalization is working and has delivered a 20% reduction in number of touches for our delivered package, a 19% reduction in miles traveled to deliver packages to customers and more than 1,000 basis point increase in deliveries fulfilled within region, which is now at 76%. This is a lot of progress. Sometimes I hear people make the argument that Amazon is chasing faster speed, while driving its costs higher and where it doesn’t matter much to customers.This argument is incorrect. There are two things to note. First, customers care a lot about faster delivery. We have a lot of data that shows when we make faster delivery promises on a detail page, customers purchase more often, not just a little higher, meaningfully higher. It’s also true that when customers know they can get their items really quickly, it changes their consideration of using us for future purchases too. Second, when shipments come from fulfillment centers that are closer to customers, they travel shorter distances, which cost less in transportation, gets there faster and is better for the environment. There’s a lot of goodness in that equation. This ability to have shipments closer to customers is the result of a lot of work and invention on the regionalization side, placement logic and local in-stock algorithms.So which are the most profitable technology companies in 2023? The top three are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Apple Inc.

Today, AI is actually changing business outlooks.""Demand for our data center platform for AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries and customers,"" Nvidia founder &amp; CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday.""Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp, as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity.""Nvidia stock closed Thursday up 0.10% in the first trading session since its earnings report.Second quarter revenue for Nvidia totaled $13.51 billion, a 101% jump from last year and well above Wall Street's expectations for $11.04 billion.In the 1990s, companies like Cisco (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL), and Intel (INTC) saw their share prices soar as exuberance mounted around the prospects for the chipmakers.The New York Times even called Cisco a ""bellwether"" for the stock market in 2000. But less than a year later, the company cited a macroeconomic slowdown as it cut jobs and profits swung to losses.Thomas Russell, then an associate professor of economics at Santa Clara University, told The Times in 2001 the slowdown at Cisco was a ""wake-up call"" for the semiconductor industry, noting the roles that Cisco played in the economy moving forward hadn't changed.Story continuesAll three stocks would fall about 80% as the dot-com bubble popped.In July, BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fundamental equities Tony DeSpirito described demand as ""really real"" at a media roundtable and said the earnings growth from AI is ""just coming.""Indicators that demand is outpacing Nvidia's supply have abounded on earnings calls this quarter.In July, Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company would ""take Nvidia hardware as fast as Nvidia will deliver it to us.""During recent earnings calls, Big Tech giants Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also noted that Nvidia GPUs are powering some AI projects at their respective companies. Meta said generative AI is holding users on the app longer and driving additional revenue.""Although we recognize emerging competition from the large cloud service providers (i.e. captive/internal solutions) as well as other merchant semiconductor suppliers,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Toshiya Hari wrote in a research note on Thursday, ""we expect Nvidia to maintain its status as the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive moat and the urgency with which customers are developing/deploying increasingly complex AI models.""Huang estimates there are about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise software systems. Capital spend in those industries is shifting to building out accelerated computing and generative AI capabilities, he said, but that spend is about $250 billion, indicating the transition is far from over.""This is not a near-term thing,"" Huang said. ""This is a long-term industry transition, and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.""Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech about AI and gaming during the Computex Taipei exhibition at the world trade center in Taipei, Taiwan, Tuesday, May 30, 2017.

But how sustainable is the stock's growth? Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick and Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss.On Nvidia’s earnings call, the company explained how the technology is being used and the partnerships it has with other companies. Howley explains, “there are means to an end here, where real products come of this” and these products, “will benefit consumers, as well as regular workers.”In the 1990s, tech companies Qualcomm (QCOM) and Cisco (CSCO), saw their stocks rise, but “the market got way ahead of itself,” Sosnick says, and the stocks ultimately dropped. For Nvidia, “there are other headwinds in terms of valuation that we have to consider. And the question is, will this deliver and will this deliver to bottom lines, not just be a great technology?” Sosnick explains.Video Transcript- And what I was struck by on the call-- I mean, in addition to-- you and I have spoken to Jensen Huang before, and he is very good at sort of spinning a grand narrative and has delivered on that narrative, at least in some measure. But I was also struck that the company gave specific examples of its partnerships and how the tech is being used sort of concretely, which I thought was interesting.So talk to us. Like, how big a deal is this to sort of answer some of the stuff that Steve was talking about?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, I think for a lot of companies, the hyperscalers kind of are looking at this as almost a kind of, if not an extension of cloud computing, then a new iteration on cloud computing. Now obviously it's two different types of technologies, right? But when you look at the way it's being spoken about from NVIDIA's side of things, from Microsoft's side of things, from Google's side of things, Meta, Amazon, it seems as though this is a kind of a new generation.Story continuesAnd so what Microsoft's-- you know, just going back to their earnings, tried to lay out--- And when we talk about hyperscalers, we're talking about--DAN HOWLEY: Big cloud companies.- Like a Microsoft.DAN HOWLEY: Right. Meta outside of that. But still in the generative AI side of things. But when we go back to Microsoft's earnings and Google's earnings, what they did was they tried to encapsulate what generative AI is doing for them. How they're using it, what customers are starting to get into it. And so Microsoft wanted to make sure that people knew that it's starting to pay off for them.Didn't get too specific in numbers, but we saw that when they priced their-- I believe it was Microsoft 365 Copilot, shares just blew up. It was $30 per person per month. So Google tried to do the same thing. So we're seeing these companies now come out and explain, you know, it's not just my kid's going to type this in and maybe, you know, cheat on his exam or whatever.But there are means to an end here where real products come of this. And it will benefit consumers, as well as regular workers. But I think that's something that, you're right, that Jensen was really, really particular about ensuring that shareholders knew that, in their mind, that it's not a fad. Now, you know, there have been faddish things that Nvidia's not necessarily pointed to before but fallen, let's say, victim to the whole, you know, crypto craze obviously. They were really stung by that.The metaverse and, you know, the VR, AR, they're still working with that. But you know, it was kind of spoken of as this next big trend. But it seems as though AI is going to be, as Steve said, it's not new. It's the type of AI. This is not like, you know-- I mean, we've talked about this before. Siri is AI, guys. I know it's not great, but it's AI. I don't know what to tell you.But this is a new version of AI. And I think, you know, how that eventually is worked out is what Nvidia is trying to put forward, as well as the likes of Microsoft and Google.- Steve, we had ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott tell us that this is like an iPhone moment for enterprise software.- Yeah, Jensen has said that, too.- Exactly. And ServiceNow, one of the companies that got called out on the call last night, too, and some of the partnerships with Nvidia, when you see this many mega-cap tech companies having a massive partnership for a transformational technology as generative AI, does that tell us for the equity markets that these valuations, even if they might seem lofty right now, are actually substantive and warranted at the same time?STEVE SOSNICK: I guess that really depends on how you think this proceeds. You know, the positive example is, I couldn't-- you know, I thought Nvidia investors had said had set such a high bar for themselves that it was impossible to leap over. And yet they did and cleared it by a wide margin.On the other hand, you know, those of us who were around during the, you know, the '90s, the internet and, you know, Cisco being the backbone of the internet and Qualcomm being the power of cell phones, those two technologies were as transformative as everyone thought.- And by the way, we have a chart overlaying them because you brought this up. So this is Nvidia in 2023 versus Qualcomm and Cisco in 1999. Qualcomm was up something like 600% that year or something. Cisco was a lot less. But nonetheless, it still saw a big increase.STEVE SOSNICK: And these were transformative technologies and these companies are still here today. But the market got way ahead of itself.- And then they-- stocks plunged in the next following couple years.STEVE SOSNICK: Exactly. So I'm not coming on TV and saying Nvidia is going to plunge, you know, similar to that tomorrow. But markets get ahead of themselves. Markets get enthusiastic, and there are other headwinds in terms of valuation that we have to consider. And the question is, will this deliver, and will this deliver to bottom lines, not just be a great technology?]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best 5G Stocks To Buy Now.5G is one of those areas that are guaranteed to grow and see huge investments in the coming years. The 5G boom will give rise to a complete ecosystem, which, when coupled with future technologies like AI and IoT, will create a plethora of opportunities in the industry. Governments and private sector around the word are scrambling to unlock opportunities in the 5G space. The 5G connectivity penetration will create new growth avenues in hardware and software space. A 2020 report by Edward Jones on 5G said that 5G connectivity will take quite some time to realize due to complex and technical infrastructure needs. The report also said that 5G deployment will not be able to reach completion levels until software developers test and gauge how to best utilize high speeds and response times that are unlocked by 5G.The report also talked about some specific companies that stand to benefit from the upcoming 5G revolution.""In the communication services sector, we anticipate that Verizon (VZ) will be well-positioned to offer 5G services because it is aggressively building its 5G network. We believe that AT&amp;T (T) will also benefit from 5G, although its business is more diversified than Verizon's, so 5G may have less of an impact on AT&amp;T's overall results. For investors seeking international diversification, Canadian telecom company BCE (BCE) will be introducing 5G services, although we expect the 5G build in Canada to lag about a year behind the U.S implementation. Also, we believe Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOGL) could benefit from 5G due to its significant investment in developing driverless-vehicle technology. We anticipate that American Tower (AMT) will benefit because service providers throughout the world will need to add 5G equipment at wireless tower sites. However, we note that all of these companies have exposure to a number of markets besides 5G, so results can be impacted by changes in other parts of their businesses.""Story continuesThat’s why investors are looking for promising opportunities in the space to benefit from the long-term growth catalysts in the industry. However, the industry has seen headwinds lately amid a decline in spending. Nokia’s management recently talked about these challenges and said that the slowdown in the 5G sector would prove to be short term as there’s still a huge demand and appetite for investments. Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark recently said in an interview with Bloomberg that there’s “substantial need for operators to invest in 5G globally with only approximately 25% of the potential mid-band 5G base stations so far deployed outside China.”The economic benefits of the 5G revolution will be seen far and wide. A PwC report estimates that healthcare sector will be the biggest beneficiary of the 5G connectivity penetration. The report said that the 5G effect on healthcare could add almost half a trillion dollars to global GDP. Other industries that stand to benefit from 5G include utilities, consumer, media, industrial manufacturing and financial services. PwC said that in aggregate, 5G adoption will add about $13 trillion to global GDP by 2023. The report said that the biggest benefit of 5G will be seen in North America, followed by Asia and the Oceania. However, as mentioned by Edward Jones, PwC also said that initially, the effect of 5G will be slow and not much visible. But starting 2025, there will be glaring benefits of 5G visible in different economies throughout the world.Best 5G Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Mika Baumeister on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article first scanned Defiance 5G Next Gen Connectivity ETF (NYSEARCA:FIVG) and listed its holdings.

Through both organic development and acquisitions led by CEO Matt Murphy since he took over in 2016, Marvell has built a portfolio of market-leading products and IP across computing, networking, security, electro-optics, and storage. Consequently, the company is a critical partner for hyperscale cloud service provider, data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end-market customers. Marvell is targeting 15% to 20% average revenue growth through the semiconductor cycle in the coming years, largely driven by secular trends and company-specific product innovations within the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets. We believe Marvell can deliver on or exceed this target because, among other growth opportunities, its market-leading optical products are critical to delivering increasing data transmission speeds required by hyperscale customers in AI training and inference. At the same time, the company is simultaneously ramping up a custom silicon business working directly with hyperscale partners. Given the dislocation in the stock on near-term cyclical concerns, we believe we paid an attractive price for the long-term growth of this industry-leading company.”11. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a REIT that operates properties for data centers, wireless communications infrastructure and related operations.

Weaker demand for handsets, elevated channel inventory and an underwhelming Chinese economic recovery resulted in a more difficult‐than‐expected short‐term outlook. Qualcomm executives are navigating the short‐term challenges by actively managing operating expenses. In recent years, despite threats of large clients developing in‐house chips (e.g., Apple and Samsung), Qualcomm has been able to retain its high market share forged by a history of high spending in R&amp;D and what we consider to be technological superiority. Longer term, we believe Qualcomm will continue to benefit from 5G penetration, as well as from the execution of its diversification strategy, asInternet of Things and Automotive remain attractive end markets. As the world continues on the path toward a proliferation of connectivity between varying devices (e.g., smart phones, tablets, wearable technology, Wi‐Fi access points, factory automation and infotainment systems in autos), we are convinced the company is in a strong position to continue to win market share in both existing and new end markets, and to continue to return FREE cash flow to shareholders.”8.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Broadcom contributed to outperformance, as the company is seen as a key beneficiary of the investment in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). The company’s Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips are being custom-built for customers to use in their data centers for accelerated computing. Broadcom’s networking chipsets are also expected to see increased levels of demand, as customers increase investments to enable the high-speed data transfer required by advanced AI training and inference. The company also announced a new multi-year supplier relationship with Apple, the company’s largest customer.”7. Analog Devices, Inc.

Analog Devices and Danaher are both seeing end market demand moderate (in semiconductor and medical research, respectively) compared to the artificially high levels they experienced for two years due to the post-Covid chaos in supply chains.
