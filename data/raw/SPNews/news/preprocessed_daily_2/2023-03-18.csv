You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. On March 10, federal regulators seized the assets of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which marked the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis of 2008. The collapse of SVB rattled investors’ confidence, as they started pulling their assets and deposits out of the bank soon after the crisis. According to a report by Bloomberg, top executives at 15 banks lost $267 million in wealth in the span of days following the collapse. The rippling effects of this fallout were felt in Europe as well.As investors registered their fears regarding the fallout, President Biden assured the nation of the banking system’s safety. He announced that investors will have access to their deposits whenever they need. In a joint statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg also attempted to boost investor confidence by offering loans to banks for up to one year. Here are some comments from the Fed:“This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.”Despite government intervention, bank stocks continue to fall in value. The S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index declined by 12.88% in the past five days, compared with a 2.28% return of the S&amp;P 500.Considering this slump in the banking sector, wealth advisors recommend putting money across different asset classes. Patrick Dwyer, managing director at NewEdge Wealth, spoke to CNBC about possible investment strategies to follow. He asserted that investors should put money into Treasuries and money markets as they can offer around 5% risk-free return during elevated interest rate periods. Similarly, Michael Zeuner, managing partner at WE Family Offices, also highlighted the importance of cash in this environment. He mentioned:Story continues“For so many years, cash was just not an interesting investment. It was paying zero, so people weren’t really paying attention to cash. Over the last year, as rates came up, and as the fear of a recession kicked in, a lot of families started to take some risk off the table. It went into cash. And so cash, from an investment perspective, [has] all of a sudden become a much more important part of the portfolio.”During such economic environments, the main focus of investors is to generate stable and regular income. Investing in dividend stocks is one of the best ways to achieve this goal as these companies reward investors with monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts.Keeping in mind the current situation of the banking sector, we will discuss the best bank dividend stocks in this article. Some of these companies include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.Unum Group (UNM) is a stock many investors are watching right now. UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 5.67 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 9.86. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 5.49, with a median of 6.54, all within the past year.Investors should also note that UNM holds a PEG ratio of 0.84. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. UNM's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.71. UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.42, with a median of 0.54, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is UNM's P/B ratio of 0.82. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. UNM's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.43. Over the past year, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.49, with a median of 0.82.Story continuesValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.63. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.79.Finally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. UNM's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.48. UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.70, all within the past year.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Unum Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

FL is expected to register a decline in its top and the bottom line from the last fiscal year’s respective quarterly reported figures when it releases fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Mar 20, before the market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $2,152 million, indicating an 8.3% fall from the prior fiscal year’s quarterly reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings currently stands at 52 cents per share, suggesting a decrease of about 69% from the earlier fiscal year’s quarterly figure of $1.93. The consensus mark has increased a penny over the past seven days.We expect revenues to decline 8.6% to $2,139 million and adjusted earnings to plunge 72% to 47 cents per share for the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales (comps) are likely to drop 7.8%.This athletic shoes and apparel retailer delivered an earnings surprise of 22.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Key Factors to NoteFoot Locker’s quarterly performance might have been hurt by a tough macroeconomic landscape including inflationary pressures affecting customers’ spending decisions and currency headwinds. Also, increased markdowns on higher promotional activity and supply-chain cost pressures are weighing on the company’s margins. These factors coupled with any deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses might have hurt FL’s performance in the fourth quarter.On its last earnings call, management had projected a total sales decline of 8-10%, with comps falling 6-8% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. It had anticipated a gross margin of 29-29.3% and the SG&amp;A rate to deleverage 90-100 basis points to 23.3-23.4%. Foot Locker had envisioned adjusted earnings of 45-53 cents a share for the fourth quarter.    However, management has been trying to improve performance through operational and financial initiatives. FL has been making efforts for a while to enhance digital capabilities and strengthen assortments to aid growth. Foot Locker is progressing well with its FLX membership program and strategic deals, including partnerships and acquisitions.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.U.S. Bancorp in FocusU.S. Bancorp (USB) is headquartered in Minneapolis, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -16.63% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.48 per share, with a dividend yield of 5.28%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.95% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.77%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.92 is up 2.1% from last year. Over the last 5 years, U.S. Bancorp has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 8.58%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. U.S. Bancorp's current payout ratio is 43%. This means it paid out 43% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for USB for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.01 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 12.58%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, USB is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.CF Industries' Q4 Earnings Beat, Sales Lag EstimatesCF Industries recorded earnings of $4.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a rise of 33% from the year-ago quarter's $3.27.

Net sales increased 2.7% from $2,540 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The rise in top line was mainly attributable to an increase in prices across the company’s most segments due to disruption in the global supply chain of fertilizers, resulting from higher global energy costs, reduced operating rates globally and geopolitical factors.Segment HighlightsNet sales in the Ammonia segment increased 3.3% year over year to $804 million in the reported quarter. Sales volume declined from the prior year’s levels in 2022. Average selling prices increased year over year on lower supply availability, lower operating rates and higher energy costs.Sales in the Granular Urea segment declined 8.6% year over year to $605 million. Both average selling prices and sales volume increased in 2022. Sales volume climbed due to higher supply availability resulting from higher production, whereas the increase in selling prices was aided by lower supply availability, lower operating rates and higher energy costs.Sales in the UAN segment climbed 15.4% year over year to $845 million. Both average selling prices and sales volume rose in 2022.Sales in the AN segment rose 25.2% year over year to $189 million. Sales volumes were down year over year in 2022, while average selling prices increased on reduced supply.Story continuesFY22 ResultsEarnings for full-year 2022 were $16.38 per share compared with $4.24 a year ago.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Evan Hefer, Founder and CEO of Black Rifle Coffee Company. Evan?Evan Hefer: Thanks, Tanner, and good afternoon, everyone. It's hard to imagine it's been a full year since our first earnings call as a public company, but I'm excited to share some highlights from 2022 and lay out our goals for 2023. Just under a decade ago, I started this business in my garage with a 1-pound coffee roaster, roasting one bag at a time with my wife. At that time, we were just a small D2C brand focusing on a small portion of the coffee drinking public. Fast forward to today, Black Rifle has established itself not only as a mainstream brand but also as an omnichannel CPG business, less than six months into our launch at Walmart, we have risen to the number four 4 brand in bagged coffee and within that, the number one selling branded 12-ounce bagged coffee, the largest dollar volume package size within Walmart's bagged coffee segment.Story continuesWe've also solidified ourselves as the fastest-growing brand in ready-to-drink coffee, outpacing the category growth by over four times at year-end. We are the number three RTD coffee within the convenience channel, outpacing Dunkin'. We partnered with some of the most recognizable brands in the world, launching a co-branded coffee with Amazon Prime Video and becoming the official coffee of the Dallas Cowboys. In addition, we've continued to maintain the biggest branded subscription coffee business in the United States and grown the largest social media following across all coffee companies and other lifestyle brands. We've done all of this with our aided brand awareness in the mid-20s. I'm more excited than I've ever been about the future of this brand as we're just getting started on this journey to a $1 billion business.Looking into 2023, we have three main goals that we are focused on, which are, one, driving top line revenue growth, two, increasing brand awareness, and three, achieving profitability. Our decision to distribute bag coffee and rounds within food, drug and mass or FDM was driven with all three goals in mind. The at-home coffee segment is an $11 billion market with Walmart's coffee sales representing about a third of that volume entering into the FDM channel allowed us to participate in this segment where most coffee is purchased for at-home consumption. Not only is FDM coffee our most profitable channel, but it's also the most cost-efficient way to increase brand awareness and reach new customers. We previously mentioned that 66% of our shoppers exclusively purchased coffee from brick-and-mortar locations.These shoppers were previously unreachable to our brand, but we are increasing our availability to be accessible wherever coffee customers shop. In late Q3 of 2022, we entered over 4,400 Walmart stores with a product assortment of 24 SKUs, including both bag coffee and rounds. Black Rife has quickly risen to the number four brand in bag coffee, eclipsing the sales of a number of established brands. The incrementality that our brand is driving on shelf is extremely compelling. Per numerator data, almost 35% of households that purchase Black Rifle Coffee or new coffee buyers to Walmart. These shoppers had shopped at Walmart previously, but had not purchased anything from the coffee category in the prior 26 weeks prior to launch. Additionally, the data indicates 62% of their households purchased Black Rifle were switching from another brand.With over 30 million shoppers visiting Walmart stores each day, we're confident that our premium products and mission-driven brand will continue to create a new and loyal customer while increasing our brand awareness. We are less than six months into our launch into the FDM strategy, and we've been focused on executing and delivering on the commitments of our initial rollout. We're still at the beginning of this journey, but the initial results indicate that we are winning and taking market share from other established brands in the largest coffee retailer in FDM. This confirms that our strategic expansion was the right decision for the company as we continue to transition from primarily D2C to an omnichannel CPG business. Our marketing strategy is mirroring that transition.With this, we are able to focus our marketing spend on high-level brand awareness as well as wholesale specific marketing campaigns. We're spending less total dollars in D2C. And because of this, we've elevated our expectations for returns on the spend. This higher return on ad spend ROAs is driving lower customer acquisition costs and increasing profitability. This overall shift into marketing spend will enable leverage on the marketing line for 2023 and beyond. Being efficient in our marketing spend is one of the drivers for achieving profitability in 2023. We are also reducing corporate SG&amp;A costs and driving gross margin as we strive to achieve our adjusted EBITDA goals for the year. Growing our brand and driving profitability allows us to support our mission by continuing to give back to those who have served.Our mission was the foundation of this company when I started at almost a decade ago. In 2022, we've donated over $2 million in cash in coffee into veteran, active duty and first responder causes. Close to half of all of our employee base are veterans and veterans' spouses, and we continue to hire more as the business grows. We want to be a shining example for how military veterans can build a successful company. Our mission comes with challenges, but so does every mission for which we've deployed. Our challenges are different now, but we meet them with the same determination and expectations for results as I did when I was at Greenbrae. I founded this company to make a difference in veterans lives and we're doing that every day. I'm proud of our team for the tremendous growth they've driven over the past year and how well they've adopted to growing multiple businesses simultaneously.I'm just as driven now as I was when I started the business back in 2014, 2023 will be a banner year for Black Rifle. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Tom.Pixabay / Public DomainTom Davin : Thanks, Evan, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by highlighting the key initiatives for our commitment of profitability for 2023, including details from each channel of our business. Then I will briefly discuss our Q4 earnings and provide updated guidance for 2023. Commitment to profitability. As some of you may have seen at our ICR presentation in January, we highlighted three key drivers of our commitment to profitability for 2023. Number one, expansion of our wholesale channel. This channel is our most profitable sales channel with our highest margins and return on capital. Our entry into the FDM channel with bank coffee and rounds is a significant catalyst for growth. We launched in late September of last year, and this mix shift will continue to benefit our financial performance in 2023 from having a full year of sales.Ready-to-drink is continuing to scale rapidly in the convenience store and FDM channels, where we are targeting more than 100,000 doors by year-end, up from 61,000 at the end of 2022. Note that we had approximately 70,000 doors at the end of Q3. On retailer with 18,000 doors ran a test for a limited time in Q2 and Q3. The test was successful, but the doors were not included in the Q4 number because the test was completed in the prior quarter. We're now shipping product to this retailer at the end of Q1 for ongoing distribution, recapturing those 18,000 doors. Innovation will be a key growth driver for this segment. We've introduced innovation for the first time by launching two new core SKUs in Q1, salted caramel and vanilla, plus three additional seasonal limited time offerings.The first of these LTOs is a Berry Mocha SKU, entering the market at Memorial Day. We believe that taking advantage of the demand for black rifles coffee and RTD within the wholesale channel will create the most strategic value for the company and our shareholders. Number two, price increases. We've now taken pricing across all channels of our business. We've also taken additional pricing actions in February for RTD and another price increase for our direct-to-consumer subscribers in Q1 of 2023. Our consumers have not exhibited any tendencies to trade down nor have we seen lower coffee consumption in response to the price increases. Number three, cost leverage. Over the past couple of years, the management team has invested in developing the omnichannel platform and the infrastructure to support it.In 2023, we will balance the need to obtain EBITDA profitability while not compromising growth. We began this work in Q1, resulting in reductions to SG&amp;A, including an 8% reduction in corporate headcount. We are being selective with our spending as it has become clear. The wholesale business is going to be our key driver of growth for the next several years, allowing us to focus our efforts and realize operating leverage. Historically, we have invested ahead of revenues. We stood up new lines of business. As we move out of the launch phase, a tailwind for the wholesale channel is that as the business scales, our investment as a percentage of revenue will continue to decrease. Outside of SG&amp;A reduction, we will also benefit from easing inflationary pressures, which we anticipate will support our efforts to create operating leverage.As part of our commitment to growth and profitability, we've recently added two executives who have dramatically enhanced our leadership capabilities. Chris Clark joined as our new Chief Technology Officer from Levi Strauss, where he served as Chief Information Officer. Chris is a West Point graduate and served as a U.S. Army Aviation Officer prior to transitioning into corporate America. We also brought aboard Marty Manning, our Chief Human Resources Officer, who came to us for more than a decade at General Electric and most recently was the CHRO of Ascend Learning. Marty also served in the U.S. Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer and Intelligence Officer. These are just two examples of the caliber of people who are joining our cause to build this business for the future.Channel highlights. Now I will expand on the key channels and profitability levers we have taken within each. As Evan mentioned earlier, we are fortunate enough to be able to launch bag coffee and rounds or K-Cups in Walmart in September of last year. The launch included an initial assortment of 24 SKUs or roughly 12 linear feet of our ground coffee and K-Cups or what we call round into 4,400 Walmart stores. Note that certain Walmart stores with a smaller coffee section do not have all 24 SKUs. This launch was an exciting opportunity for Black Rifle as the FDM coffee space represents an $11 billion and growing at-home coffee market, which Walmart represents close to a third of that volume. As a P13 Nielsen data, less than four months into our initial launch, we represented 3.5% of Walmart's total coffee business, and this share continues to accelerate, growing to 3.8% through the end of February.From a dollar standpoint, the 12-ounce bag size is the highest dollar volume pack in the coffee aisle. Black Rifle Coffee is the number one branded bag in this pack size with 22% of the sales over the last four weeks per Nielsen data. Needless to say, we are excited about the consumer response and the initial launch results. We are committed to deepening our current relationship and maximizing the opportunity at hand within FDM. In 2023, we will be bringing relevant shopper innovation and initiating marketing campaigns to drive further awareness and trial. We look forward to sustained growth within the FDM channel as we shift marketing and promotional resources to support expansion. As you can imagine, with the public Nielsen and IRI data, we've had lots of inquiries from other FDM retailers.And we've looked at at least one additional FDM account during the summer reset period for the FDM coffee aisle. We will scale our FDM business as rapidly as possible without sacrificing quality or customer service. That said, there are several keys to expanding across this channel. Most importantly, our entry into Walmart has shown the relevance of our brand nationally and with a broad base of consumers, which will got our launches with other retailers. We have the capacity to support coffee expansion across the FDM category. We also have the opportunity to tailor our pack sizes to be relevant to grocery shoppers, particularly in the case of rounds or K-Cups. We'll continue a deliberate FDM rollout strategy for the next several years to ensure our brand presentation is maximized and that we deliver a high level of service to all FDM accounts.RTD growth levers. Now turning to the other portion of the wholesale channel, RTD or ready-to-drink coffee. The addressable market for the ready-to-drink coffee business is $4 billion, growing at approximately 11% per annum versus 3% for the roasted coffee segment, driven primarily by younger consumers. This explosive growth and adoption of cold coffee consumption has been a major reason why we continue prioritizing growth and market share in this category. Throughout 2022, we added 20,000 doors and increased our ACV percentage to 38.3% from 13.5% at the end of 2021. More importantly, per Nielsen, our RTD dollar sales compared to a year ago were up almost 44% over the last 13 weeks through December 31, more than four times the category growth of 9.8%.This has been achieved by unit growth of 34% versus the category, which shows our demand for the brand and our loyal customer base. As we entered 2023, we are seeing momentum build for the RTD business. Compared to the December results, over the last 13 weeks as of February 25, our dollar growth has increased 1,300 basis points from 44% to 57%, driven by a 500 basis point increase in unit growth from 34% to 39% and a price increase of approximately 800 basis points that occurred in early February. Drivers for this momentum include innovation launches, increased distribution and incremental facings. We announced our first RTD innovation with the launch of two additional core SKUs and three seasonal limited time offerings. We've also continued to expand our distributor network and recently unlocked access to over 12% of the U.S. population, taking our coverage to 96%.The half one reset period has also allowed us to expand on top of our current base of 150,000 facings, adding an incremental 100,000 facings. We are seeing these incremental facings being reflected in current planograms in both legacy retailers and new doors. Towards the end of Q1, we have begun shipping product in support of roughly 40% of these new facings with the remainder shipping in Q2. In Q3 of last year, we outlined our start-up challenges with new RTD production and ingredient supply, which delayed our ability to fully leverage our RTD capacity unlocks in 2022. These speed bumps are now behind us with all three of our co-man partners executing the 2023 plan to capitalize on all of our growth initiatives for this year and beyond. Lastly, I want to highlight our inventory levels going into F1.As many of you know, the convenience store reset cycles happen twice a year for seasonal load end, with a majority of resets occurring in the spring. The most impactful way to grow distribution is to work within our customers' timelines and processes. After adding additional capacity in 2022, 2023 is the first year we've been able to produce enough cases to be fully prepared for the half one resets. Our new capacity has allowed us to build adequate inventory to meet commitments to our customers and distributors throughout the year, supporting accelerating growth levels we've seen within our brand in this category. As Greg will tell you later, you should expect our inventory levels to normalize as this product hits the shelves in Q2. Direct-to-consumer.Now turning to our direct-to-consumer or D2C channel. Our relationship with our consumer is significantly stronger than other traditional brands, with over 2 million lifetime online customers who become advocates and influencers to others driving people to the brand. We have the largest branded coffee subscription business in the U.S. with over 270,000 subscribers at year-end. Like many D2C brands, we've seen the cost to acquire customers continue to climb. In response, we've modified our approach to investing in new subscribers such that we achieve a payback now in one month versus four to six months previously. To date, our churn rate is staying within our historical average of 3% to 4% per month despite the two recent price increases. We continue to refine our marketing strategies and are focused only on spending on initiatives that will meet or beat our demanding internal return thresholds outpost strategy.Lastly, I want to expand on our outpost channel. In Q4, we opened four company-owned stores in core markets in Texas and Arizona, ending the year with 15 company-owned outposts and 11 franchised outposts. We are a relatively small company with huge demand for our products across multiple sales channels. And because of this, we've had to prioritize internal bandwidth as well as capital. We've decided to phase our growth decisively prioritizing FDM and ready-to-drink sales in the near term, which will also maximize short and long-term profitability. This shift in focus frees up cash from reduced CapEx and SG&amp;A, given that the growth in FDM and RTD is asset-light. We continue to see tremendous long-term opportunity for the outpost segment, but we need to continue refining our prototype model to ensure that our outposts can reach our demanding return thresholds before ramp-up expansion.Work on the prototype is ongoing. We plan to build prototype units in 2024. For 2023, we now plan to open three company-owned outpost, all of which will be in core Texas markets where we are operating other outposts today. Q4 update and guidance for 2023. Finally, I want to update you on our 2023 full year guidance. Last August, we provided our preliminary 2023 outlook of $500 million or more in revenue. Given the number of market variables we don't fully control, we've concluded that we are overly ambitious with our initial 2023 revenue target due to the timing of various load-in cycles and customer onboardings within the wholesale channel for coffee and RTD and our more disciplined approach to outpost, we're pushing some of our forecasted revenue from 2023 to 2024.We are still committed to achieving adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2023 and are reaffirming that commitment today. To achieve this outcome, we take a more conservative approach to 2023 revenue and adjusting our SG&amp;A costs accordingly. Today, we are resetting our 2023 revenue target to a range of $400 million to $440 million or approximately 33% to 46% growth over 2022's revenue of $301 million. Our gross margins will be in the range of 36% to 37.5% even with the lower revenue range we're committed to $5 million to $20 million of adjusted EBITDA. Those of you who remember, this is actually very similar to the 2023 outlook we provided when we went public a little over a year ago. To bridge the gap from our initial $500 million revenue target, I want to provide more context for what has changed that led us to revise our outlook.we made a $40 million adjustment driven by timing to our RTD forecast due to the follow-through from start-up delays in 2022 and a slower ramp-up of sales for the spring reset period. Additionally, we transitioned from a third-party sales firm in Q4 and built an entirely new internal sales team. This allows us to better control our business and relationships with distributors as well as end customers. While leading this transition, our team is taking a more conservative approach to forecasting relative to the third party. All of our sales plans are now built from the bottoms up view of our distributors and end customers. So we have much more confidence given the enhanced visibility this has provided. FDM. We've adjusted the FDM bag coffee and rounds revenue by $30 million based on the timing of adding additional FDM accounts thus pushing some of the revenue into 2024.As I mentioned earlier, we've had strong interest from multiple large FDM players. We are currently working on different sizing of products, building out our supply chain and refining our pricing architecture for these potential customers. There's interest from certain retailers to include Black Rifle Coffee in their 2023 summer resets, but we will be able to do a much more comprehensive across the FDM channel in 2024. Based on the initial results at Walmart showing Black Rifle's brand strength across all regions of the country and our relevance to a broad set of shoppers. We'll be able to design these launches as national rollouts with the optimal shelf assortment for our brand. Outpost. We're making a $10 million reduction in outpost revenue given the slower pace of openings in '22 and '23 as we prioritize our investments to support the wholesale channel.While we know our retail business has significant growth potential, the core of any strategy is prioritizing resource allocation. With the ROIC highest in the wholesale business, we're shifting our resource to capitalize on that demand and achieve adjusted EBITDA and profitability in 2023. We are excited for the opportunities ahead for the Black Rifle Coffee Company and believe we are well positioned for sustained profitable growth for years to come. With that, I will turn it over to Greg to walk through the financials and give some additional details on our full year guidance as well as some detail regarding Q1.Gregory Iverson: Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will discuss our 2022 fourth quarter and full year financial results, touch on our balance sheet and liquidity position and then share some further details on our fiscal year 2023 outlook. Turning first to our financial results. For the fourth quarter, total revenue increased 30% to $93.6 million compared to $71.8 million in Q4 of last year. For the full year, our total revenue grew by 29% to $301.3 million. The meaningful increase in revenue was driven by growth within our wholesale and outpost channels, which continued their impressive growth from 2021 by 140% and 33%, respectively. Now I will give some additional details on our three sales channels. First, our direct-to-consumer revenue decreased 8% in the fourth quarter to $45.6 million compared to $49.6 million last year.For the full year 2022, our direct-to-consumer revenue decreased by $6.3 million or 3.8% to $159 million due to a decrease in our new customer acquisition for non-subscription customers. This decline was mainly attributable to decreased digital advertising spend as we continue to prioritize our high-growth and high returning wholesale channel. Turning to wholesale. Our wholesale revenue increased 140.1% to $41.2 million in Q4 compared to $17.2 million last year. For the full year 2022, our wholesale revenue increased $63.6 million or 114%, bringing our total wholesale revenue to $119.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our RTD product, which ended the year in over 61,000 doors. Our percent ACV or all commodity volume, as measured by Nielsen, which measures distribution across both convenience, gas and FDM increased to 38.3% versus 13.5% a year ago.Additionally, our entry into food, drug and mass also drove very significant growth during the last four months of the year as we successfully launched into over 4,400 Walmart stores. Next, revenue and outpost increased 34.3% to $6.8 million in Q4 compared to $5.1 million last year. Outpost revenue growth throughout 2022 increased $10.9 million or 91% to $22.9 million compared to $12 million for 2021. Throughout 2022, we opened a total of seven new company-operated stores in Texas and Arizona, bringing our total number of outpost to 26 and with 15 company-owned stores and 11 franchised stores. Turning to our profitability. Our Q4 gross margin was 31.5%, decreasing 290 basis points from 34.3% in Q4 of last year. For the full year 2022, our gross margin was 32.9%, a decrease of 556 basis points from 38.5% in 2021.The decrease was driven by inflationary pressures, as well as costs related to RTD production start-up, which reduced our Q4 gross margin by 190 basis points and full year 2022 gross margin by 170 basis points. We have taken action across multiple fronts to combat the cost of inflation we have been experiencing. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we took price in line with our competitors across our product portfolio and in each sales channel. We implemented the majority of these pricing actions in the second half of 2022 and into Q1 of 2023, so the full impact of these actions will flow through our P&amp;L throughout the remainder of 2023. As a result, we expect our margins will improve sequentially beginning in Q1. As a percentage of sales, our operating expenses during Q1 increased by 1,200 basis points to 52.3% as compared to last year.For the full year, our operating expenses increased to 55.4% of sales, up 1,200 basis points from 2021. I will walk through the drivers of these increases beginning with marketing and advertising. For the fourth quarter of 2022, marketing expense increased 22.5% to $13.6 million from $11.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a percentage of sales, marketing decreased by approximately 90 basis points to 14.5% compared to the same quarter last year. For full year 2022, our marketing expense increased 5% to $38.2 million compared to $36.4 million in 2021. Importantly, for the full year 2022, marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 15.6% to 12.7%, a decline of 290 basis points as we're beginning to see the leverage on our branding investments as our business scales and we focus our investments in our wholesale channel.Moving on, salaries, wages and benefits expense for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 87.8% to $16.9 million from $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a percentage of revenue, it increased by approximately 550 basis points to 18% compared to 12.5% last year. For the year, salaries, wages and benefits increased 66% to $64.3 million compared to $38.7 million for 2021. The increase was driven by employee head count to support our significant sales growth across multiple sales channels. We've invested heavily in building out our management teams, particularly within our wholesale sales channel. Also, as a reminder, a large portion of our outpost cost structure is included in the salaries, wages and benefits line as it includes the compensation costs for our employees working at our outpost.G&amp;A expenses increased 112.6% to $18.5 million compared to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a percentage of revenue, G&amp;A increased by approximately 760 basis points to 19.7% of revenue compared to 12.1% last year. For the full year, G&amp;A increased 146.5% to $64.5 million compared to $26.2 million for the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by our investments in corporate infrastructure, including technology, to support the growth of our business across multiple channels, as well as growth in our corporate outposts. As Evan and Tom mentioned, we invested capital in all areas of the business to scale each of our channels after becoming a public company. Now that we're into 2023, we are beginning to see the operating leverage in those investments.Additionally, given the prioritization around our wholesale business, we have taken the opportunity to rightsize some of the areas of our business. To that end, we've made material progress on rightsizing our corporate SG&amp;A in Q1. We look forward to sharing more details on those initiatives on our first quarter earnings call. In addition to the GAAP measures I have just mentioned, adjusted EBITDA is an important profitability measure that we use to manage our business internally. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $11.4 million compared to a loss of $863,000 in 2021. For the year, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $34 million compared to a loss of $145,000 a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to increased spending to scale and rapidly grow our multiple sales channels.Now I'll briefly touch on our balance sheet and liquidity. We ended 2022 with $38.9 million of cash on the balance sheet compared to $18.3 million as of December 31, 2021. We also had $49.2 million of debt compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2021. On our balance sheet, you will also see a material inventory build, which is mostly in RTD. You will remember that last year, we were selling every case that we made and it forced us to focus on our core customer base and not be able to onboard new distributors or customers. Accordingly, for the first time, we have been building inventory to support the accelerated growth we are anticipating in RTD throughout 2023. Due to this inventory build, we used $37.5 million of cash in Q4 and to prepare for the RTD expansion.So while we drew down some of our liquidity for that, we expect to turn much of that working capital into cash beginning in our second quarter. Today, we have $55 million of liquidity, which we define as cash plus available borrowings on our senior credit facility, which is prior to our $15 million minimum liquidity condition required under the facility. We believe our current liquidity, combined with positive EBITDA in 2023, prudent working capital management and focused CapEx investment provide us sufficient liquidity to continue growing the business. Before we take your questions, I'd like to expand on the 2023 guidance that Tom shared earlier in our call. While we do not plan on providing quarterly guidance for the remainder of the year, given how far we are into Q1 and our newly announced 2023 plan, we thought it would be helpful to provide some color on Q1 and our quarterly cadence throughout 2023.For Q1, we expect revenue of $80 million to $82 million. The small range is primarily due to order fulfillment timing for RTD and FDM orders expected to be fulfilled during the last week of the quarter as some of those deliveries may move into April. Turning to gross margin. We expect an improvement in our Q1 gross margin of 100 basis points versus Q4 of 2022. Lastly, for Q1 adjusted EBITDA, we expect to see a sequential improvement of a couple of million dollars from Q4 of 2022 on a lower revenue base, but higher gross margin and lower SG&amp;A. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see revenue growth rates and our gross margin accelerate. And lastly, we expect our adjusted EBITDA will approach breakeven in Q2 and be positive in Q3, an increase into Q4.With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions.See also 12 Biggest Ocean Cleaning Companies in the World and 13 Cash Rich Penny Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 9.3% loss over the past four weeks.The upside can be attributed to the strength of its diversified solutions suite that continues to drive the commissions and fees of Aon. The sound performance of Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions and Wealth Solutions segments also contribute to its top-line growth. Management anticipates a mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond.This insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.23 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.3%. Revenues are expected to be $3.81 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Aon, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised marginally lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on AON going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As a result, for the first quarter of 2023, EQR will pay out 66.25 cents per share, up from 62.50 cents paid out in the prior quarter. This new dividend will be paid out on Apr 14 to the company’s shareholders of record as of Mar 27, 2023.Based on the hiked rate, the annualized dividend comes at $2.65 per share. At this new rate, the annualized yield comes in at 4.50%, based on the stock’s closing price of $58.91 on Mar 16.The residential REIT also announced that its annual meeting of shareholders would be held on Jun 15.   The latest raise reflects Equity Residential’s ability to generate a solid cash flow through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. Prior to this latest increase, EQR increased its dividend four times in the past five years, and its payout has grown 3.45% over the same period. Check Equity Residential’s dividend history here.EQR is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio diversification efforts in the urban and suburban markets with an affluent tenant base. Healthy demand for its apartments has been aiding occupancy level and strong pricing power in recent quarters.In February, Equity Residential reported fourth-quarter 2022 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 94 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The rental income of $699.7 million exceeded the consensus mark of $697.1 million. On a year-over-year basis, the normalized FFO per share grew 14.6% from 82 cents, while the rental income increased 8.5%.For 2023, Equity Residential projected normalized FFO per share of $3.70-$3.80. The company’s full-year guidance incorporates projections for same-store revenue growth of 4.5-6.0%, an expense increase of 4-5% and an NOI expansion of 4.75-6.25%. Also, physical occupancy is expected at 96.2%.The company’s strategic buyouts, encouraging development pipeline, and focus on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation and efficiency of its operating platform are tailwinds. Also, a healthy balance-sheet position bodes well.Equity Residential exited 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $53.9 million. The net debt to normalized EBITDAre was 4.38X compared with 4.54X in the previous quarter. The unencumbered NOI as a percentage of the total NOI was 88.2% in the quarter compared with the 88.3% reported in the prior quarter.With solid credit metrics and sufficient access to capital markets at favorable rates, the company is well-poised to meet its future obligations, as well as ride its growth curve. However, elevated supply in some of Equity Residential’s markets is likely to fuel competition.

26,3f04cac8-4af9-381e-bb89-65697236edf5,MGM,2023-03-18,Which Casino Stock Could Fetch the Most Attractive Returns?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/casino-stock-could-fetch-most-191037059.html,1678821037,STORY,"['CZR', 'BYD', 'MGM']","[The Covid-19 pandemic crushed travel and casino companies. However, pent-up demand following the reopening of the economy boosted travel and helped drive business to major casinos. Despite growing fears of an impending recession, several Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the casino space. This is largely due to the continued momentum observed in Las Vegas.As per the latest data released by The Nevada Gaming Control board, gaming revenue in the state increased 18% year over year (YOY) to $1.27 billion in January. The largest win came from the Las Vegas gaming strip.Moreover, with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in China, casinos with exposure to Macau are likely to see solid recovery as the year progresses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBearing a favorable demand backdrop in mind, I used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool to compare the following casino stocks. I then identified the one that Wall Street finds the most attractive at current levels.Caesars Entertainment (CZR)Caesar's Palace (CZR) in Las VegasSource: Jason Patrick Ross/Shutterstock.comCaesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) has recovered well from Covid-19-led weakness, as reflected in its recently reported fourth-quarter results. Revenue grew nearly 9% YOY to $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Robust performance of the company’s Las Vegas business helped offset the slight weakness in the regional business due to weather-related disruption in December.The company highlighted that the occupancy rate came in at 95.5% during the quarter, bouncing back to pre-Covid levels for the first time since the pandemic. Moreover, digital revenue jumped over 100% to $237 million and helped in significantly bringing down the adjusted EBITDA loss of the division. Management assured investors that digital business will be an “EBITDA contributor” this year, with both sports betting and iGaming expected to be EBITDA positive.Following the Q4 print, Jefferies analyst David Katz increased his price target for CZR stock to $63 from $55 and reiterated a “buy” rating. Katz said, “The deleveraging process that pivots toward equity expansion continues and is evident from the results and commentary, with land-based performance gradually accelerating and digital gaming turning profitable.”Story continuesThe analyst also noted increased visibility in Caesars’ cash-flow generation, which he believes will drive the stock higher.Most analysts on Wall Street are also bullish on Caesars Entertainment, with the stock earning a “strong buy” consensus rating based on nine buys and two holds. The average CZR price target of $71.64 suggests 51.4% upside potential from current levels.Boyd Gaming (BYD)the Fremont Casino (BYD)Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comBoyd Gaming (NYSE:BYD) is one of the leading casino operators in the gaming industry. It has 28 gaming properties in 10 states. The company also has a 5% stake in FanDuel Group, a leading sports-betting operator. Continued resurgence in its Las Vegas operations helped Boyd end 2022 on a strong note.Strength in the company’s two Nevada segments, its growing online gaming business and management fees from Sky River Casino helped to more than offset the softness in the midwest and south regions. Boyd continues to see several opportunities to drive long-term growth through reinvestments in its top-performing properties and expansion of its online gaming business.Following the results, Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski raised his price target for BYD stock to $81 from $78. He also reaffirmed a “buy” rating.“BYD continues to churn out healthy operating metrics and strong free cash flow (FCF) which is being directed back to shareholders at a rapid pace. With a healthy, low-levered balance sheet, we believe BYD is the perfect name to own in any environment but more so now given the near-term remains an unknown,” said Wieczynski.Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Boyd Gaming, with a “moderate buy” consensus rating based on 10 buys, two holds and one sell. At $74.50, the average BYD stock price target implies about 24% upside potential.MGM Resorts (MGM)A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building.Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.comShares of MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) have enjoyed a strong run so far this year. This is due to solid results from the company’s Las Vegas business and expectations of a strong recovery in Macau. Last month, MGM delivered better-than-expected revenue of $3.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 18% YOY. Additionally, investors cheered the company’s new $2 billion share repurchase program.Despite robust sales, MGM slipped to an adjusted loss per share of $1.53 compared to adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 12 cents in the prior-year quarter. MGM China’s revenue declined 44% YOY due to Covid restrictions in China. Nonetheless, the company expects to deliver strong results this year, driven by MGM China’s recovery.Recently, Barclays analyst Brandt Montour initiated coverage of MGM stock with a “buy” rating and a price target of $59. Montour cited several strengths that contribute to his bullish stance, including an “unmatched combination of market breadth and premium brand positioning across both land and digital,” attractive valuation and a leading position in iGaming due to the company’s BetMGM joint venture.“MGM has attractive premium positioning in both Las Vegas and U.S. regionals, with any near to medium ‘cooling off’ risk more than offset by upside from Macau’s ongoing recovery, though Las Vegas shows no signs of slowing,” said Montour.Wall Street’s “strong buy” consensus rating for MGM Resorts is based on 11 buys and three holds. The average price target of $55.68 implies 30.5% upside potential.To conclude, despite near-term macro pressures, Wall Street remains bullish on Caesars Entertainment, Boyd Gaming and MGM Resorts. Currently, analysts see higher upside potential in CZR stock than the other two casino names. This is largely thanks to strength in its Las Vegas operations and improvement in the profitability of the company’s digital business.On the date of publication, Sirisha Bhogaraju did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Sirisha Bhogaraju has over 15 years of experience in financial research.

MIM is well-positioned to help farmers with competitive farm, ranch, timberland and agribusiness loans. Its regional network keeps them close to markets and facilitates long-term or immediate mortgage financing needs.

In addition to its petroleum business which includes a crude oil gathering system, CVR also produces ammonia, urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers, and provides storage and terminal facilities for asphalt and refined fuels.Not primarily reliant on crude oil prices, fiscal 2023 earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher for CVR in the last week. Earnings estimates have now soared 62% throughout the quarter for FY23 and 32% for FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition to its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), CVR stock has an overall “A” VGM Style Scores grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum. CVR’s valuation is attractive trading at $29 per share and 8.9X forward earnings.This is slightly above the industry average of 6.1X but much more reasonable than its decade high and a discount to the median of 11.6X. Plus, CVR (CVI) stock is still up +36% in the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -12% and the Oil Refining &amp; Marketing Markets +11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero Energy (VLO)Another stock that stands out as it is not completely reliant on crude oil prices is Valero Energy. Also part of the top-rated Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing Industry, Valero Energy is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the U.S. but is a leading ethanol producer as well.Story continuesValero has over 14 ethanol plants in the Midwest that have a combined capacity of 1.73 billion gallons per year. More impressive, Valero’s FY23 earnings estimates have jumped 30% over the last 90 days with FY24 estimates climbing 48%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero also has an overall “A” VGM grade with its valuation especially intriguing at current levels of $125 per share and just 5.2X forward earnings. This is much lower than its extreme decade-long high and a 55% discount to the median 11.7X with rising earnings estimates offering further support.Even better, Valero stock is up +38% over the last year to easily top the S&amp;P 500 and the Oil Refining &amp; Marketing Market. Furthermore, over the last three years, Valero stock has skyrocketed +257% to also crush the benchmark and beat its Zack Subindustry’s +188%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayCVR Energy and Valero’s attractive P/E valuations along with rising earnings estimates revisions is very intriguing and there could certainly be more upside in their stocks even as crude oil prices decline.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.Story continuesThere are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services &amp; Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services &amp; Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Salesforce.com ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2013 would be worth $4,244.76, or a 324.48% gain, as of March 17, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 153.75% and the price of gold went up 15.95% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects In the near-term.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 11.41%, and there have been 16 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Also, gains from cost-reduction efforts act as an upside.Notably, the company has been streamlining its organizational structure and re-energizing its employee base. The company is committed to improving operational efficiencies throughout and limiting risk.It is focused on transforming the company into a pure-play global Pet, and Home &amp; Garden business. As part of its strategic transformation, the company anticipates concluding the HHI transaction and collecting $4.3 billion in cash by June 2023.The company is also focused on its Global Productivity Improvement Plan (GPIP), which aims at improving its operating efficiency and effectiveness, while focusing on consumer insights and growth-enabling functions, including technology, marketing, and research and development. The majority of savings are expected to be reinvested into growth initiatives and consumer insights, R&amp;D, and marketing across each of the businesses. The plan will also enable the company to deliver value creation and sustainable growth in the long term.As a result, first-quarter fiscal 2023 operating expenses of $222.1 million declined 8.6% year over year. Prior to this, the metric fell 15% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research We note that shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.3% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 2%.However, Spectrum Brands continues to reel under high retail inventory that weighed on the volume of products sold in the fiscal first quarter. This, along with a difficult economic environment and dismal demand, acts as deterrents.Consequently, earnings and sales missed in first-quarter fiscal 2023 for the third straight quarter. The company reported an adjusted loss of 32 cents per share, wider than a loss of 6 cents in the year-ago period. This was mainly due to weak adjusted EBITDA stemming from adverse currency.Net sales fell 5.8% year over year to $713.3 million. Excluding the currency headwinds and sales gains from buyouts, organic net sales declined 9.5%. The downside was mainly due to lower replenishment orders, stemming from higher retail inventory and slower holiday POS.

45,155c1750-6eba-3f40-b073-391458fb62e8,MRO,2023-03-18,Marathon Oil (MRO) Down 17.8% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-oil-mro-down-17-153003833.html,1679067003,STORY,"['MRO', '^GSPC']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Marathon Oil (MRO). Shares have lost about 17.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Oil due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Marathon Oil Reports Better-Than-Expected Q4 EarningsMarathon Oil Corporation reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted net income per share of 88 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents and improving from the year-ago profit of 77 cents.Marathon Oil’s bottom line was favorably impacted by stronger oil realizations in the United States and lower overall costs.The company reported revenues of $1.7 billion, which came 1.1% above the consensus mark but fell 3.7% from the year-ago sales of $1.8 billion due to and lower domestic production.Segmental PerformanceThis Texas-based energy explorer’s total net production (from U.S. and International units) in the quarter under review came in at 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) compared to 353,000 BOE/d in the year-ago period.U.S. E&amp;P: This U.S. upstream unit reported an income of $510 million, down from $553 million in the year-ago period due to weaker production and higher costs, partly offset by higher oil realizations.Marathon Oil’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $84.29 per barrel were higher than the year-earlier level of $77.03. However, natural gas liquids average price realizations decreased 25.6% to $26.02 a barrel. Moreover, average realized natural gas prices fell 5.9% year over year to $4.93 per thousand cubic feet.Meanwhile, production costs were $6.29 per BOE, representing a 28.4% year-over-year rise. Net production of 278,000 BOE/d was down 8.6% from fourth-quarter 2021. Total U.S. output comprised approximately 56% oil, or 156,000 barrels per day (bpd).Lower year-over-year production from Bakken adversely affected the company’s quarterly performance, which was compounded by lower volumes from the Eagle Ford area. The Eagle Ford region recorded an average production of 91,000 BOE/d, down 2.2% from the level in fourth-quarter 2022, while output from Bakken was 94,000 BOE/d compared with 124,000 BOE/d in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, Oklahoma output came in at 50,000 BOE/d, down from the year-ago level of 56,000 BOE/d.International E&amp;P: The segment, which explores and produces oil and gas in Equatorial Guinea, reported earnings of $129 million compared with $106 million in the year-ago period due to higher output. Marathon reported production available for sale of 55,000 BOE/d, up from 49,000 Boe/d in fourth-quarter 2021.Marathon’s average realized liquids prices (crude oil and condensate) of $59.27 per barrel reflected a 16.9% deterioration from the year-earlier quarter. Natural gas and natural gas liquids’ average price realizations came in at 24 cents per thousand cubic feet and $1 a barrel, respectively, the same as the corresponding period of 2021.Story continuesFinancial PositionTotal costs in the quarter were $985 million, $76 million lower than the prior-year period. Marathon Oil reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged from a year ago.As of Dec 31, 2022, it had cash and cash equivalents worth $334 million and long-term debt of 5.5 billion. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 34.2. Marathon Oil spent $344 million in capital and exploratory expenditures during the quarter and raked in $763 million in adjusted free cash flow.2023 GuidanceMarathon has budgeted capital spending between $1.9 billion and 42 billion this year. Meanwhile, MRO continues to prioritize shareholder returns over production growth. The company is targeting production in the range of 385,000 BOE/d to 405,000 BOE/d – up more than 15% (at the midpoint) from last year. Further, Marathon expects oil volumes in the band of 185,000-195,000 barrels per day. Assuming $60 WTI, Marathon Oil expects to return a minimum of 40% of its cash flow from operations.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -12.28% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Marathon Oil has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 20% loss over the past four weeks.Hess is well poised to deliver long-term return, banking on its highly profitable and differentiated portfolio. HES has decided to return up to 75% of annual free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend hikes. Also, oil prices are still favorable to aid the company’s overall upstream business.This oil and gas producer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9.2%. Revenues are expected to be $2.47 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Hess, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation.

Yet the nonstop product announcements now coming from Big Tech have largely been centered around quotidian office tasks like making spreadsheets or managing Gmail or creating PowerPoint slides.While that’s disappointing on some level, it’s a perfectly reasonable business strategy.Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?Microsoft, recently, integrated OpenAI’s technology into its office tools like Word and Excel. Flashy it’s not. But by staying in their domain, tech’s giants can remain competitive while quickly releasing products to the public.Keeping it simpleWhile AI technology is improving at speed, companies like Microsoft are quick to admit that mistakes will be made. Factual errors generated in AI content remain a problem, for example.Software companies presumably could troubleshoot those kinds of issues easily when it comes to building a slide deck or summarizing a business meeting. When it comes to higher-stakes applications, the technical problems become more difficult to solve.“I worry most about mistakes in high-stakes situations, like legal or medical diagnoses,” said Graham Neubig, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon. “Humans make mistakes in those cases, too,” he added.AI applications remain limited for nowWhen OpenAI released ChatGPT-4 earlier this week, the startup said additional capabilities could lead to new risks, suggesting that more problems will come with pushing the limits of AI.If the upshot is that big tech will be conservative in how it unleashes AI to the masses, it seems a sensible tradeoff.The current work-related applications of AI are still useful, even with the occasional bug. Google Translate was introduced in 2006 and it still makes mistakes—sometimes hilariously so. That doesn’t mean it isn’t useful, said Neubig.Story continuesMeanwhile, the next batch of AI integrations in the workplace, if not all that exciting, promises to at least be helpful for productivity. “The technology is pretty impressive already,” said Neubig.More from QuartzThe US will pilot a program to renew H-1B visas domesticallyMore than half of US nursing homes are unprofitable—and it's about to get a lot worseSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

This company, which is in the Zacks Outsourcing industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This payroll processor and human-resources services provider has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 5.20%.For the last reported quarter, Paychex came out with earnings of $0.99 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.95 per share, representing a surprise of 4.21%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.97 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.03 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.19%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Paychex. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paychex currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.25%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on March 29, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Paychex (PAYX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.27 a share, just 12 days from its upcoming earnings release on March 29, 2023.Paychex's Earnings ESP sits at 2.25%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.27 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24.PAYX is just one of a large group of Business Services stocks with a positive ESP figure. Global Payments (GPN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Global Payments, which is readying to report earnings on May 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.32 a share, and GPN is 45 days out from its next earnings report.For Global Payments, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.28 is 1.84%.Story continuesPAYX and GPN's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

58,98760c39-b294-3826-9cb9-e9e781bf24f1,XEL,2023-03-18,Regulators: Nuclear plant leak didn't require public notice,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regulators-nuclear-plant-leak-didnt-014228184.html,1679103748,STORY,['XEL'],"[Minnesota regulators knew four months ago that radioactive waste had leaked from a nuclear power plant in Monticello — but they didn’t announce anything about the leak until this week.The delay in notifying the public about the November leak raised questions about public safety and transparency, but industry experts said Friday there was never a public health threat. They said Xcel Energy voluntarily notified state agencies and reported the leak of tritium to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission soon after it was confirmed and that the leak of 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of radioactive water never reached a threshold that would have required public notification.“This is something that we struggle with because there is such concern with anything that is nuclear,” said Victoria Mitlyng, a spokesperson with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “The concern is very, very understandable. That is why I want to make extra clear the fact that the public in Minnesota, the people, the community near the plant, was not and is not in danger.”State officials said that while they knew of the leak in November, they waited to get more information before making a public announcement.“We knew there was a presence of tritium in one monitoring well, however Xcel had not yet identified the source of the leak and its location,” Minnesota Pollution Control Agency spokesperson Michael Rafferty said Thursday. “Now that we have all the information about where the leak occurred, how much was released into groundwater and that contaminated groundwater had moved beyond the original location, we are sharing this information.""Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel very far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said a significant health risk would only occur if people consumed fairly high amounts of tritium. That risk is contained if the plume stays on the company’s site, which Xcel Energy and Minnesota officials said is the case.Story continuesIf regulatory officials are sure it didn’t move off site, people shouldn’t have to worry about their safety, he said, adding that companies usually take action when onsite monitoring wells detect elevated levels of contaminants like tritium.Mitlyng said there's no official requirement for nuclear plants to report all tritium leaks to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Instead, Xcel Energy had previously agreed to report certain tritium leaks to the state. When Xcel Energy shares information with the state, it also shares it with the commission.The commission posted a notification about the leak on its website Nov. 23, noting that the plant reported it to the state a day earlier. The report classified the leak as a nonemergency. The notice said the source of the tritium was being investigated at that time.Beyond that, there was no widespread notification to the public before Thursday.Rafferty said disclosure requirements fall to the facility, and state agencies would have notified residents immediately had there been an imminent threat to health and the environment.Rafferty said the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency decided to share information about its role overseeing the cleanup now “because we have more details about the location and potential movement of the contamination, steps being taken to control the plume and plans for remediation including short-term storage of contaminated water.”Mitlyng said there is no pathway for the tritium to get into drinking water. The facility has groundwater monitoring wells in concentric circles, and plant employees can track the progress of contaminants by looking at which wells detect higher amounts. There are Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors on site too, watching over the response.The company said the leak came from a pipe between two buildings.Xcel said it has recovered about 25% of the spilled tritium so far, that recovery efforts will continue and that it will install a permanent solution this spring.Xcel is considering building above-ground storage tanks for the contaminated water it recovers and is considering options for the treatment, reuse or final disposal of the collected tritium and water. State regulators will review the options the company selects, the state Pollution Control Agency said.The regulatory commission said tritium spills happen from time to time at nuclear plants, but they’ve either been limited to plant properties or involved such low offsite levels that they didn’t impact public health. Xcel Energy reported a small tritium leak at Monticello in 2009.The Monticello plant is about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, upstream from the city on the Mississippi River.Shelby Burma, who lives minutes from the site of the spill, said the news — coming weeks after a train derailment on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border left lingering concerns about contaminated air, soil and groundwater — makes her worry about an increasing amount of chemicals in the environment.“I think it’s pretty alarming that they did not notify the public right away,” Burma said. “They said it won’t cause any harm, but that’s hard to believe when they waited how long to go public with it.”___Phillis reported from New York City, Biraben from Pierre, South Dakota.

The company’s vast platform capabilities include digital and physical money movement networks across more than 200 countries and territories. It supports money flows in around 130 currencies.Courtesy of solid prospects, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth holding on to at the moment.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Western Union’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.59 per share, which increased by a penny in the past 60 days. During this time, it has witnessed four upward estimate revisions and two downward movements. The company beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, the average surprise being 8.6%.The Western Union Company Price and EPS Surprise The Western Union Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Western Union Company price-eps-surprise | The Western Union Company QuoteThe consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $4.1 billion.Growth DriversThe company actively pursues strategic alliances and partnerships to expand its geographical footprint and services offered. Its moves to strengthen operations in growing economies are expected to position the company for long-term growth. Earlier this year, WU partnered with one of the world’s largest retail chains, 7-Eleven Mexico, to ease cross-border money transfers in Mexico.It is resuming money transfer services from the United States to Cuba in multiple phases. The company also collaborated with an Australian fintech Beforepay to enhance cross-border money transfers with a Send Now, Pay Later service. Innovative products like this will combine lending and remittance services and position Western Union for better penetration of the growing remittance market.With the remittance market expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, the company’s constant efforts to expand its presence in emerging markets can increase its potential. Creating a seamless omnichannel digital experience for the customers is expected to boost its market share and capture a sizeable chunk of growth.Story continuesThe company’s Evolve 2025 strategy intends to bring high-value and accessible financial services to address the growing demand for cross-border money transfers. The program is expected to enhance its efficiency and deliver mid-single-digit growth in the bottom line for 2024 and 2025.WU’s shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy. WU’s dividend yield of 8.8% is significantly higher than the industry average of 0.8%. Last year, Western Union returned around $713 million in capital to its shareholders. At 2022 end, the company had $648.2 million left under its share buyback program.Key ConcernsThere are a few factors that can hold the stock back. In the trailing 12 months, the free cash flow after dividends declined 85.2%. Also, WU’s total debt-to-total capital of 84.6% at the fourth-quarter end was higher than the industry’s figure of 40.6%. Its high leverage ratio is concerning. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Key PicksMeanwhile, investors interested in the broader Business Services space may look at players like Nayax Ltd.

This is helping Simon Property Group and Federal Realty start to recover as well as owners and operators of these types of retail properties.Simon Property Group is the largest mall operator in the United States and internatinally with Federal Realty managing, developing, and re-developing shopping centers and mixed-use properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S., Florida, and California.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; RecoveryLooking at this year’s continued post-pandemic recovery, Simon Property Group’s fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to be up 1% and rise another 2% in FY24 at $12.27 per share. Earnings estimate revisions are slightly down over the last quarter.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 3% in FY23 and rise another 2% in FY24 to $5.56 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would only be 3% below 2019 sales of $5.75 billion as the company continues to move closer to pre-pandemic levels. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Federal Realty, earnings are expected to edge up 2% this year and pop 4% in FY24 at $6.70 per share. Even better, earnings estimates have trended higher throughout the quarter.Sales are projected to jump 5% in FY23 and rise another 4% in FY24 to $1.18 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent 26% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $936 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationSimon Property Group and Federal Realty stock have given back any year-to-date gains after the most recent selloff among the broader financial sector. Simon Property Group is now down -7% year to date near Federal Realty’s -6% with both underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s +2% and the REIT Equity Trust – Retail Markets -1%.Story continuesHowever, over the last three years, shares of SPG are up +85% to beat the S&amp;P 500 and its Zack Subindustry’s + 28% although FRT’s +3% has lagged.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors are hoping the recent market volatility created buying opportunities and both stocks can resume what had been strong performances to start 2023.Looking at the valuation of both companies this certainly seems plausible. Simon Property Group stock trades at just 9.1X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 20.9X, the median of 14.3X, and the industry average of 12X.In comparison, Federal Realty stock trades above the industry average at 15X but still below its own decade-long high of 29.8X and median of 22X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividendsSimon Property Group and Federal Realty’s dividends could make up for the recent volatility and reward patient investors. In this regard, SPG’s 6.5% yield tops FTR’s 4.4% and the industry average of 4.7% but both are well above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.6% average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayAt the moment, Federal Realty stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with earnings estimates revisions trending higher with Simon Property Group landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Simon Property Group’s earnings estimates have slightly declined, its valuation and steady top and bottom-line recovery is intruiging and investors may be rewarded for holding shares at their current levels.In terms of  post pandemic recovery and growth, Federal Realty’s stock is starting to become attractive which also makes the recent selloff among shares of FRT look like a buying opportunity with investors hoping both stocks can get back to their impressive starts at the beginning of the year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After the stock price dropped 12% last week, the company's market value declined by US$9.0b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Core Services &amp; Equipment, Abdellah Merad, for US$4.0m worth of shares, at about US$57.20 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$44.68. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Insiders in Schlumberger didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Schlumberger Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Schlumberger. Specifically, insiders ditched US$15m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Schlumberger insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$143m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Schlumberger Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Schlumberger stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Schlumberger is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Schlumberger.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this world's largest oilfield services company have returned -17.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, to which Schlumberger belongs, has lost 16.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Schlumberger is expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share, indicating a change of +76.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.02 points to a change of +38.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +25.3% from what Schlumberger is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SLB _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Schlumberger, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +26.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.74 billion and $36.48 billion estimates indicate +16.5% and +11.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySchlumberger reported revenues of $7.88 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.6%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $0.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was +2.9%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Schlumberger is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Schlumberger. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

75,5a764147-de54-3211-9c8a-22f48e0cadf5,PKG,2023-03-18,The 7 Best Retirement Stocks for Anxious Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-retirement-stocks-anxious-232721498.html,1678836441,STORY,"['SIVB', 'CVX', 'SQM', 'EPSN', 'TAIT', 'PDCO', 'PKG']","[Although any time is a good time to consider the best retirement stocks to buy, the present juncture sparks perhaps unprecedented urgency. With the implosion of SVB Financial Group, the ripple effect might not just center on one troubled enterprise. Rather, it’s quite possible that over the next several weeks and months, anxieties can impact multiple sectors, particularly risk-on assets.According to CNN Business, SVB Financial suffered a bank run due to a confluence of myriad headwinds. Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve spiked the benchmark interest rate, causing the money supply to tighten. As well, SVB held unrealized losses as the rising rates reduced the value of its bond portfolio. Then, venture capital dried up, forcing many technology startups to draw down funds held by SVB.Like it or not, investors seeking the best retirement stocks may have to tack on greater risk. At the time of writing, the U.S. 10-year Treasury Yield stands at 3.7%. Therefore, passive-income-generating equities need to yield at least that and offer some upside potential. It’s a tough ask to be sure. However, daring retirees may want to consider these best retirement stocks (under present circumstances).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCVXChevron$160.76EPSNEpsilon Energy$5.25SQMSociedad Química y Minera$78.85PDCOPatterson Companies$25.94TAITTaitron Components$3.64CIXCI Financial$13.89PKGPackaging Corp of America$131.35Chevron (CVX)Source: ©iStock.com/Murdock48At first glance, oil and natural gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might seem a risky idea for the best retirement stocks for anxious investors. After all, the broader political and ideological winds point heavily toward clean and renewable energy solutions. Unfortunately, renewables like wind and solar tend to be intermittent, only working when the sun is up or the wind is blowing. On the other hand, oil consistently generates power irrespective of outside forces (within reason).Story continuesFinancially as well, Chevron makes for an enticing market idea. First, the balance sheet enjoys several positive attributes, such as an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.62 times (ranked better than 67% of the field). Operationally, Chevron features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%, which pings above 75.62% of sector players. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period is 40.7%, outpacing almost 77% of the industry.Further, its net margin is 15%, within the top third of the hydrocarbon sector. It also supports the company’s forward yield of 3.78%. Notably, Chevron commands 37 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg CVX as a moderate buy, assigning it a $190.15 price target. This implies 19% upside potential.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockA lesser-known energy firm, investors will do well to familiarize themselves with Epsilon Energy (NASDAQ:EPSN). An on-shore focused independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, gathering, and production of oil and gas reserves, Epsilon may be a bargain due to its forward relevancies. Still, it will require patience. Since the Jan. opener, EPSN gave up over 16% of its equity value.However, the underlying financials may be too attractive for market participants to ignore. For one thing, Epsilon enjoys excellent stability in the balance sheet. Most conspicuously, it carries zero debt, giving it incredible flexibility during these difficult times. Operationally, the hydrocarbon specialist features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%, above 75.62% of sector players.In addition, the company’s net margin stands at nearly 50%, outpacing over 92% of the field. Such robust profitability helps Epsilon carry a forward yield of 4.67%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 40.32%, facilitating confidence regarding yield stability. Right now, nobody covers EPSN. However, given its undervalued nature – with a price-earnings ratio of less than 4 times – EPSN could fly substantially higher.Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM)Vitamin DSource: ©iStock.com/EpicStockMediaA Chilean chemical company, Sociedad Quimica y Minera (NYSE:SQM) is the world’s biggest lithium producer. As the underlying commodity for lithium-ion batteries, lithium of course commands extraordinary relevance. Should the future of transportation be electric, then it will be vital for companies to secure lithium supply. As well, enterprises will need to find supplies from jurisdictionally friendly sources. SQM hits the nail on the head on both counts.To be fair, investment resource Gurufocus.com warns that SQM may be a possible value trap. That said, the financials on paper look incredibly attractive. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 81.3%, blowing past the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 36.4%, again dominating the field.On the bottom line, the mining firm features a trailing net margin of 36.39%. This helps undergird the company’s robust forward yield of 15.07%. Still, investors should be careful about its payout ratio, which flies up to 110.77%. For full disclosure, covering analysts peg SQM as a hold. That said, their average price target stands at $103, implying over 30% upside potential. Thus, it could be one of the best retirement stocks to buy.Patterson Companies (PDCO)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockA medical supplies conglomerate, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) primarily focuses on the business of veterinary and dental products. Fundamentally, neither arena will likely fall out of relevance anytime soon. Further, with millennials gravitating heavily toward pet ownership, the veterinary angle should be a long-term winner for PDCO, making it one of the best retirement stocks.To be sure, Patterson doesn’t have as many attractive fiscal attributes as its competitors. However, it does enjoy a solid balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score comes in at just above 4, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, the market prices PDCO at a forward multiple of 11.27. As a discount to earnings, Patterson ranks better than 75% of the competition.Looking at the bottom line, the company posts a trailing net margin of 3.08%, outpacing 61.45% of its peers. This helps bolster the company’s forward yield of 3.94%, which ranks much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Finally, analysts peg PDCO as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $31.79, implying over 20% upside potential.Taitron Components (TAIT)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Valencia, California, Taitron Components (NASDAQ:TAIT) is a national distributor of brand-name electronic components and supplier of originally designed and manufactured (ODM) electronic components. Granted, the broader electronics market presents significant risks. However, over the long run, the normalization of the global economy should make TAIT one of the best retirement stocks.To be fair, Taitron will require some patience among market participants. However, it also wouldn’t be fair to classify TAIT as a purely speculative wager. For instance, the company benefits from a robust balance sheet. Most notably, it features no debt, again providing much flexibility during these troubles. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 14.37, indicating extremely low bankruptcy risk.On the bottom line, Taitron posts a trailing net margin of nearly 40%, outpacing almost 99% of the industry. Naturally, this top-level figure bolsters the company’s forward yield of 5.38%. Conspicuously, this comes in much higher than the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Lastly, no analysts cover TAIT. However, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 6.31, which is extremely low. Thus, TAIT could fly much higher from here.CompX International (CIX)Source: InvestorPlace unless otherwise notedHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, CompX International (NYSEAMERICAN:CIX) represents one of the lesser-known candidates for best retirement stocks. However, it plays a critical role in the background. According to its website, CompX is a diversified domestic manufacturer of engineered, quality components providing critical functionality to our customers’ products.Financially, the company presents a unignorably compelling profile. To begin with, CompX enjoys excellent stability in the balance sheet, particularly because it suffers no debt. As well, its Altman Z-Score pings at 10.14, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, CompX features a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.6%, above nearly 74% of the industry.Notably, its net margin is 12.53%, outpacing almost 80% of its peers. In addition, this stat helps undergird CompX’s forward yield of 5.44%. That’s significantly higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Currently, no analyst covers CIX. However, given its low price-earnings ratio of 10.87 (compared to the sector median of 16.63), CIX can certainly swing higher.Packaging Corp of America (PKG)Pros and Cons of Retirement Income FundsSource: ShutterstockPerhaps the riskiest idea among the best retirement stocks, Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) specializes in custom corrugated solutions. Per the company’s website, corrugated packages offer the most environmentally friendly form of packaging available. That helps in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) department. Moreover, e-commerce may continue to rise in pertinence over the next several years.Following a sharp dip from the pandemic highs, e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales bounced conspicuously higher throughout 2022. Therefore, PKG might rise in relevance as e-commerce trudges forward despite the pressures of inflation. For full disclosure, analysts have a dim view of PKG, citing about a 5% downside risk. However, the upside of the e-commerce narrative could be the bigger catalyst.Financially, Packaging doesn’t feature outstandingly remarkable stats but decent metrics. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 7.3%, above nearly 59% of the industry. Its main strengths lie in its profitability, though. For instance, its net margin stands above 12%, beating 89% of the competition. Finally, Packaging carries a forward yield of 3.78%. Further, its payout ratio sits at 54.15%, which should be a sustainable yield.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Shares have lost about 19.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is American International Group due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AIG Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Winter Storm Costs HurtAmerican International Group, Inc. reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of $1.36 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.3%. However, the bottom line slumped 13.9% year over year in the fourth quarter.Operating revenues of $12.2 billion declined from $13.7 billion a year ago but beat the consensus estimate of $11.8 billion and our estimate of $11.7 billion.The better-than-expected results were supported by solid North America Commercial Lines growth and improved underwriting income in General Insurance. However, the positives were partially offset by reduced alternative investment income, higher expenses and losses due to the winter storm.Quarterly Operational UpdateTotal net investment income tumbled 8.6% year over year to $3,258 million due to a decline in alternative investment income, and reduced call and tender income. The figure was higher than our estimate of $2,968.1 million.American International’s total benefits, losses and expenses of $11,307 million increased 25.1% year over year primarily due to higher general operating and other expenses, and a net loss on divesture against a gain in the year-ago period. The figure was much higher than our estimate.Adjusted return on common equity deteriorated 240 basis points (bps) year over year to 7.5% in the fourth quarter.Segmental PerformancesGeneral InsuranceThe segment reported net premiums written of $5,610 million, which declined 6% year over year but grew 1% on a constant-dollar basis. The metric was lower than our estimate of $5,834.9 million. Lower capital market activities affected Financial Lines’ performance, while a fall in warranty and underwriting actions taken in Private Client Group negatively impacted Personal Insurance’s figures. The negatives were partially offset by strong North America Commercial Lines growth.Story continuesUnderwriting income of $635 million jumped 27% year over year in the fourth quarter. The same comprised catastrophe losses (CATs) of $235 million, primarily due to Winter Storm Elliott, comparing unfavorably with CATs of $189 million in the year-ago quarter.The segment’s combined ratio improved 250 bps year over year to 89.9% in the quarter under review.Life and RetirementAmerican International closed the IPO of Corebridge Financial, the holding company of its Life and Retirement unit, in September 2022. Following the move, American International has 77.7% of Corebridge and combines its results of operations in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Premiums of the segment decreased to $2,145 million in the fourth quarter from $2,743 million a year ago. The figure missed our estimate of 0.4% year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, premiums and deposits of $8,800 million jumped 2% from a year ago. Adjusted revenues of the segment amounted to $5,298 million, down from $6,124 million due to lower alternative investments and premiums. The figure was lower than our estimate of $5,635.4 million. The segment’s adjusted pre-tax income of $781 million fell from $969 million in the fourth quarter.Financial Position (as of Dec 31, 2022)American International exited the fourth quarter with a cash balance of $2,043 million, which decreased from $2,198 million at 2021-end. Total assets of $526.6 billion decreased from $596.1 billion at 2021-end.Short and long-term debt of $21.3 billion fell from $23.7 billion at the prior-year end.Total equity slumped to $42.2 billion from $68.9 billion at the prior-year end. Total debt and preferred stock to total capital was at 34.1% at the fourth-quarter end.Adjusted book value per share was $73.87, up from $68.83 a year ago.Share Repurchase &amp; Dividend UpdateAmerican International rewarded shareholders with $779 million in repurchases and dividends worth $243 million.Concurrent with announcing the fourth-quarter results, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 32 cents per common share. The dividend will be paid out on Mar 31, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Mar 17.Full-Year UpdateAmerican International’s 2022 total revenues of $56.4 billion increased from $52.1 billion in 2021. However, adjusted earnings of $4.55 per share declined from $5.12 a year ago. Total benefits, losses and expenses increased to $42.2 billion in 2022 from $40 billion in 2021. Net income increased to $11.3 billion from $9.9 billion a year ago.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates flatlined during the past month.VGM ScoresCurrently, American International Group has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookAmerican International Group has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

80,bb9ed819-afaf-3b60-aab3-1cb3b18b515b,HOLX,2023-03-18,BD's (BDX) New FDA Approval to Improve Vaginitis Testing,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bds-bdx-fda-approval-improve-144002384.html,1679064002,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, recently received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the BD Vaginal Panel on the BD COR System. The panel is a comprehensive diagnostic test that directly detects the three most common infectious causes of vaginitis using BD's high-throughput molecular diagnostic platform for large laboratories.The BD Vaginal Panel is the third assay available for use on the BD COR System in the United States, the first being the BD Onclarity HPV (human papillomavirus) assay and the second being the BD CTGCTV2 molecular assay. The latest regulatory approval is expected to solidify BD’s foothold in the global Molecular Diagnostics business, thereby boosting its overall Life Sciences segment.A Few Words About the PanelThe BD Vaginal Panel was originally granted marketing authorization for the BD MAX System in 2016. The panel is the first microbiome (the community of microorganisms, such as fungi, bacteria and viruses, that exists in a particular environment)-based polymerase chain reaction assay that uses a single swab and test to simultaneously detect organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). The test reports a clear positive or negative result for each condition separately.The 510(k) clearance for the BD Vaginal Panel on the BD COR System is the first high-throughput version of the test.Significance of the ApprovalThe accurate diagnosis of BV, VVC and TV is critical for ensuring appropriate treatment routines and decreasing the risk of associated complications and resistance to treatment. The use of a single test can also aid in reducing the need for repeat testing and unnecessary use of treatments as well as lower the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs).The three most prevalent non-viral STIs are Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), which can also have overlapping symptoms. With the clearance of BD Vaginal Panel on the BD COR System, labs are now expected to offer physicians both BD Vaginal Panel and BD CTGCTV2 testing from one swab and one patient collection.Story continuesFurther, if a test is positive for VVC (commonly known as a yeast infection), the BD Vaginal Panel is currently the only FDA-cleared Nucleic Acid Amplification Test that provides separate results for the two Candida fungi species (C. glabrata and C. krusei) that are resistant to traditional antimicrobials, thereby ensuring proper treatments.Per management, a recent study has shown that many women did not receive the appropriate diagnosis and treatment for their vaginitis symptoms after an initial physician visit. This made them schedule a new appointment due to persistent symptoms. Management believes that the BD Vaginal Panel will likely end the cycle of repeated visits, misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment for millions of women suffering from vaginitis.Industry ProspectsPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global molecular diagnostics market is anticipated to reach $30.2 billion by 2027 from $23.2 billion in 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4%. Factors like the emergence of new viruses, technological advancements in molecular diagnostics and the growing awareness of early disease diagnosis are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Recent Developments in Life Sciences ArmLast month, BD received the FDA’s approval for the BD Onclarity HPV Assay to be used with the ThinPrep Pap Test. The two most common Pap vials currently used by laboratories in the United States are the BD SurePath Liquid-based Pap Test vial and the Hologic ThinPrep Pap Test PreservCyt Solution vial.The same month, BD reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein it registered an improvement in the overall base revenues. BD Life Sciences segment saw the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit’s strong growth in the base business (driven by strong demand for BD’s respiratory testing portfolio, which was partly aided by the timing of dealer orders, strong BD Kiestra lab automation installations and leveraging its higher BD MAX installed base for molecular In Vitro Diagnostic assay growth) and strength in the Biosciences unit.Price PerformanceShares of BD have lost 9.2% in the past year compared with the industry’s 9.6% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 12.5% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, BD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC and Avanos Medical, Inc. AVNS.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

They purposely made Netflix the easiest service to share and built a tremendous amount of loyalty from viewing and the shows that they have,"" Jason Helfstein, managing director and head of internet research at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., told Yahoo Finance Live in an interview on Wednesday.""So we just think investors are too pessimistic about how this will play out,"" he said, estimating the crackdown on password sharing could add $2-$8 billion in incremental revenue this year.In its quarterly letter to shareholders published in January, Netflix said it would be intensifying its push to combat password sharing in Q1, although the streamer did not provide details on when exactly that would occur and what countries would be impacted.Since then, Netflix has broadened its crackdown to include countries like Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain, in addition to the test countries of Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru. So far, there has been no announcement regarding U.S. users.Signage at the Netflix booth is seen on the convention floor at Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, U.S., July 21, 2022. REUTERS/Bing GuanThe password crackdown may have forced Netflix to slash prices overseas, a staunch concern for investors with shares sinking 7% since the price cut announcement on Feb. 23.""We believe such dramatic price reductions across so many markets confused the Street,"" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a new note to clients on Thursday, surmising the price cuts reflect the pending ""global enforcement of password sharing.""The company slashed prices by 50% in about 100 overseas markets, including Yemen, Jordan, Iran, Kenya, Croatia, Venezuela, Indonesia, among others. According to Citi research, that's about 6% of its subscriber base.""The Netflix story is going to remain a little complex as investors contend with the new ad tier and concurrent password sharing enforcement,"" Bazinet added.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Still, Netflix's password crackdown and its recently launched ad-supported tier have been seen as meaningful profitability drivers, especially as competition within the streaming space escalates.Helfstein, who has an Outperform rating on the stock and a current price target of $415 a share, cautioned it's still early days for Netflix's ad tier, but that the company has tools to improve the overall ad experience for consumers.""Netflix should be able to have very targeted ads. There's a lot of data that suggests that as long as the ads are targeted and relevant, consumers don't hate them,"" he said. ""For most consumers, if they really find the ads annoying, they'll pay the extra $3.""Since Netflix launched its ad tier on November 3 in the U.S., shares are up about 13% — outpacing the Nasdaq's 9% gain over that same time period.

85,f2eb58fc-9884-3792-8dc7-38227b77e756,PSX,2023-03-18,The 7 Best Investments for Passive Income in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-investments-passive-income-225454343.html,1678834494,STORY,"['CMCL', 'MPX', 'PSX', 'XOM', 'DRD', 'MSM']","[While it’s always a good time to consider the best investments for passive income, this category enjoys significantly boosted relevance based on recent events. As you’ve undoubtedly heard, the banking sector suffered a severe confidence hit due to the collapse of SVB Financial Group. As CNN Business pointed out, it’s the biggest failure of a U.S. bank since Washington Mutual in 2008.Fundamentally, a deadly combination of higher interest rates, exposure to low-yielding bonds, and pain among technology startups sparked a bank run. Unfortunately, SVB Financial simply lacked the resources to meet everyone’s panicked requests. More critically, it’s possible over the next few weeks and months that the crisis could ripple to other financial institutions.Therefore, investors need less exposure to risk-on assets and more to enterprises with established and profitable businesses. To achieve this, the best investments for passive income will feature a balance between yield and capital gains potential. Below are some compelling ideas to consider.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsXOMExxon Mobil$106.94PSXPhillips 66$97.95MSMMSC Industrial$82.23CMCLCaledonia Mining$13.90DRDDRDGOLD$7.45MPXMarine Products$12.85BKEBuckle$36.34Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Retail Gas LocationSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs one of the top hydrocarbon energy giants in the world, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) benefits from ongoing and long-term relevancies. Admittedly, the political and ideological winds favor clean and renewable energy sources. However, because renewables like wind and solar tend to be intermittent, Exxon should benefit from the “consistently-on” nature of hydrocarbons. In other words, crude oil doesn’t need the sun to go up to facilitate power production.Financially, Exxon delivers an attractive profile for prospective investors of the best investments for passive income. Currently, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 15.9%, outpacing 72.35% of the competition. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 37%, above nearly 79% of the oil and natural gas industry. In terms of passive income, Exxon carries a forward yield of 3.38%. As well, its payout ratio sits at a sustainable 36.46%. Moreover, it enjoys 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg XOM as a moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $127.87, implying nearly 19% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comA downstream hydrocarbon energy specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) primarily focuses on the refining and marketing component of the value chain. Fundamentally, this segment should attract considerable demand moving forward. With social normalization trends rising, more people should hit the roadways, leading to greater revenue. Also, with mass layoffs occurring, more people are desperate to hold onto their jobs, a cynical beneficiary for PSX.Objectively, the numbers also make PSX one of the best investments for passive income. Right now, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 4.41. As a discount to earnings, Phillips 66 ranks better than 70.77% of the competition. Also, PSX trades at a sales multiple of 0.28. Here, the company is undervalued compared to nearly 81% of the field. Presently, the energy firm carries a forward yield of 4.15%. Further, its payout ratio sits at 32%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PSX as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $128.20, implying nearly 27% upside potential.MSC Industrial (MSM)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockAn industrial equipment distributor, MSC Industrial (NYSE:MSM) is one of the largest companies of its kind. Also, it’s enjoyed a quietly steady performance among the best investments for passive income. Since the start of the year, it’s up less than 1%. However, it did gain 3% in the past 365 days. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 index fell more than 7% during the same period.What makes MSM a candidate for best investments for passive income centers on its resilience. Looking at its balance sheet, the company’s Altman Z-Score is 4.74, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, its revenue growth of 2.8% over the past three years rates somewhere in the middle of its industry. However, its net margin stands at 9.34%, above almost 86% of the field. Presently, MSC Industrial carries a forward yield of 3.84%. Further, it commands 19 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it won’t give up on easily. Plus, its payout ratio is 51.55%, which should be sustainable.Finally, analysts peg it as a moderate buy with an $87.50 price target. This forecast implies over 6% upside potential.Caledonia Mining (CMCL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comBilled as a profitable cash-generative gold producer, Caledonia Mining (NYSEAMERICAN:CMCL) admittedly features a high-risk profile among the best investments for passive income. Obviously, Caledonia’s fortunes largely align with the price of gold. However, precious metals can be extremely volatile. Nevertheless, the recent bank run implies that fear has spiked among investors. And gold represents an ideal avenue for assuaging fear due to its intrinsic value.Fortunately, prospective investors of the best investments for passive income won’t have to rely solely on narrative-based speculation. For instance, CMCL represents an undervalued opportunity, with the market pricing it at a trailing multiple of 5.65. In contrast, the sector median pings at 11.69. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate is 15.6%, outpacing 70.36% of the industry. Notably, Caledonia also enjoys a trailing net margin of 21.53%. This helps enable the company to offer a forward yield of 4.29%. As well, its payout ratio is 54.81%, which should be sustainable.Unfortunately, no analyst covers CMCL. However, the rising relevance of gold makes this an unignorable opportunity.DRDGOLD (DRD)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Based in resource-rich South Africa, DRDGOLD (NYSE:DRD) is both a gold producer and a specialist in the recovery of the metal from the retreatment of surface tailings. Like Caledonia Mining above, DRDGold faces underlying volatility risks. Further, the real possibility of more aggressive interest rate hikes may pressure gold. That said, with the most recent bank run, the Federal Reserve may need to rethink its hawkish strategy.Setting aside the narrative, investors seeking the best investments for passive income will be attracted to the value proposition. Presently, the market prices DRD at a trailing multiple of 10.34. As a discount to earnings, DRDGold ranks better than 60.71% of the competition. Operationally, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 14.4%, beating out 68% of the field.Also, DRDGold’s trailing net margin stands at nearly 22%, outpacing over 84% of its rivals. That’s going to help in the dividend department. Per TipRanks, DRDGold’s dividend yield is 3.6% while its payout ratio is 31.5%. Finally, H.C. Wainwright’s Heiko Ihle pegs DRD as a buy with a price target of $15. If shares get there, this would represent an upside of over 105%.Marine Products (MPX)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAs a manufacturer and distributor of luxury pleasure boats, Marine Products (NYSE:MPX) might not seem like one of the best investments for passive income given the challenging economic circumstances. However, the wealth gap that widened during the coronavirus pandemic actually benefits the ultra-wealthy, Marine Products’ target demographic. Also, MPX represents a strong market performer, gaining over 13% of equity value in the trailing year.Objectively, the company offers very attractive financials. First, the market prices MPX at a trailing multiple of 10.9. As a discount to earnings, Marine Products ranks better than 65.26% of sector peers. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 9%, above 73.49% of competitors. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period is 13.8%, beating out 63.79% of its rivals.Further, the enterprise’s net margin is 10.59%, ranked better than almost 90% of sector players. In turn, this helps support the underlying forward yield of 4.32%. Notably, this yield is much higher than the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. While no analyst covers MPX currently, its undervalued profile should make it one of the best investments for passive income.Buckle (BKE)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the riskiest idea for best investments for passive income, investors should exercise caution with Buckle (NYSE:BKE). As an American fashion retailer selling clothing, footwear, and accessories for men, women, and children, Buckle obviously depends on the whims of consumer tastes. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, BKE is volatile, shedding 17% since the January opener. However, it also gained over 5% in the trailing one-year period.Financially, there’s plenty to like about BKE stock. First, the underlying enterprise enjoys a cash-rich balance sheet. As well, its Altman Z-Score is 6.04, reflecting fiscal stability. Operationally, the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 12.9%, outpacing 75.44% of the field. Also, its FCF growth rate during the same period stands at 42.9%, above 81% of the industry.Quite attractively, its net margin pings at nearly 19%, beating out over 96% of competitors. In turn, this margin bolsters the company’s forward yield of 3.71%. Conspicuously, its payout ratio sits at 29.79%, providing prospective investors with confidence. Finally, Buckle is undervalued, trading at only 7.45 times trailing earnings. Therefore, it makes for an intriguing candidate for the best investments for passive income.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for TJX Companies:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$28b - US$10b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Thus, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 16%. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceIn the above chart we have measured TJX Companies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for TJX Companies.So How Is TJX Companies' ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at TJX Companies, we didn't gain much confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 45%, but they have dropped over the last five years. However it looks like TJX Companies might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Our Take On TJX Companies' ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by TJX Companies' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 100% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing TJX Companies, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.TJX Companies is not the only stock earning high returns.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy for 2023. Jonathan Barratt, the CEO of CelsiusPro, suggests that investors should purchase copper during a downturn when there is a chance to do so. Referring to a shortage of resources and a significant requirement for copper in the renewable energy sector, Barratt told CNBC on March 2: “Our outlook for 2023 and 2024 is: when you get a dip in copper prices, it’s something to have in your portfolio. There is just not enough supply. And when we look at everything that’s happening in the environmental space, the renewables, everything, copper is a key component. So that’s a buy on dip at any chance you get.”Moody's Investors Service has revised its worldwide outlook for Metals &amp; Mining from negative to stable due to a slight improvement in business conditions in the US and Europe. Additionally, China's reopening of the economy has boosted demand for base metals, steel, and coal, further supporting this shift in outlook. Moody's stated that there are indications of an increase in demand for base metals, and their prices are being supported by limited inventories. The price of aluminum is expected to remain above the average historical level until early 2024 due to various factors, including its growing role in clean energy. Copper's prices will be supported by historically low inventories and ongoing industry supply disruptions. While nickel is expected to have a surplus in 2023, the electric vehicle market's gradual growth in demand will result in supply deficits. Finally, zinc prices will be supported by limited supply, low inventories, and high energy costs, which will push out high-cost producers.The copper industry is trying to become greener. The largest copper producers in the world have announced their plan to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. This initiative is aimed at attracting investment funds that prioritize environmental concerns. The International Copper Association (ICA) has projected a doubling of copper demand from 2020 levels to 50 million tonnes by 2050. Thus, it has set targets for its members to decrease their direct and indirect emissions by 30% to 40% by 2030, 70% to 80% by 2040, and ultimately reaching zero by 2050. The process of producing copper from scrap metal usually involves the use of electricity, making it a more straightforward process to reduce carbon emissions.Story continuesOn March 16, the European Union introduced legislation aimed at increasing the supply of metals critical to the energy transition, including copper and nickel, by categorizing them as critical raw materials. This move highlights the increasing political concerns regarding the long-term availability of these metals, as the rising demand for them due to global decarbonization efforts continues. Copper, which is one of the largest markets for industrial metals, was not included in the European Union's previous list of critical raw materials released in 2020. Due to its varied uses in manufacturing, construction, and industrial operations, it is widely considered a barometer of global economic activity. However, concerns are rising about potential deep shortages in the future due to its surging usage in electric vehicles and renewable energy. According to the CEO of Glencore Plc, Gary Nagle, copper production will need to nearly triple by 2040 to meet the targets for net-zero carbon emissions. This increase in demand is expected to cause a 15% surge in copper prices, pushing them above $10,000 per ton, where they will likely remain.To benefit from the boom in the copper industry, some of the best copper stocks to buy this year include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). Our Methodology For this article, we selected copper stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”     Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023.    Suggested articles:13 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Now13 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners Disclosure: None. 10 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The massive growth in its top line helped strengthen its cash balance, which stands at a mighty impressive $22.7 billion. Nevertheless, with Covid-19 cases declining, forward sales estimates for the firm are concerning, leading to the PFE stock sell-off.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, Pfizer is aware of these concerns and is looking to leverage its robust financial flexibility to pursue a more aggressive mergers and acquisitions policy. Consequently, it has acquired firms like BioHaven Pharma, Reviral, and cancer-drug maker Seagen in the near future. Its management has guided for non-Covid sales of roughly a billion through 2030, representing a 7% CAGR from 2019. Despite the slowdown in sales, Pfizer’s dividend profile remains in excellent shape, with a 4% yield and 12 consecutive years of payout expansion.Undervalued Dividend Stocks: Rio Tinto (RIO)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comStory continuesDividend Yield: 7.2%Relative % Below 52-week high: 45.8%Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is a leading metals and mining player, with an incredible track record of business expansion and shareholder rewards.

It’s the leading iron ore producer, a key component of steel, which recently reached its highest price since July last year. Steel demand is expected to grow at a healthy pace due to a surge in U.S. infrastructure spending, China’s reopening, the robust demand for automobiles, and the increasing demand for airplanes. Moreover, Russia-Ukraine is raising defense spending, positively impacting the steel demand.Despite relatively softer prices, the company reported stellar adjusted EBITDA numbers of roughly $4 billion. Moreover, in the current year, it expects an annualized EBITDA of over $20 billion; therefore, cash flows should remain healthy for the foreseeable future. Moreover, its investments in other metals, including copper and nickel, should pay many dividends in a low-carbon economy. Speaking of dividends, the company has an incredible yield of 4.6%, trading more than 50% lower than its 52-week high price.City Office REIT (CIO)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockDividend Yield: 10.8%Relative % Below 52-week high: 98.7%City Office REIT (NYSE:CIO) is a leading real-estate-investment trust (REIT) with a portfolio of Class A office buildings in the Sunbelt region.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The 146-year-old bourse suffered a sharp fall in its annual trading volumes following the episode last March and could soon see competition from a new UK-based platform for physical delivery of nickel, which is used in everything from stainless steel to batteries for electric vehicles.""Reform of the LME's metal delivery rules is long overdue,"" Australian mining giant BHP said in its half-year economic outlook last month. ""The LME short squeeze episode highlighted vulnerabilities that had been building for years.""A big test for the bourse will come on Monday when nickel trading will resume during Asian business hours, starting at 9am HKT (1am GMT), following a pause of more than a year.Exchange officials hope the extended hours will expand the available liquidity in the metal and mark another important return to normality after a year of soul-searching and reforms designed to restore confidence in the market.In early March last year, the price of nickel and other commodities surged on concerns of shortages following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions in reaction to the war.Story continuesIn a three-day period, the price of nickel jumped more than 270 per cent on the LME, triggering nearly US$16 billion in margin calls by bourse members as nickel producers and traders covered their short positions.The rapid price movement squeezed dozens of short-sellers, including the world's largest stainless steel producer, Tsingshan Holding Group of China.By the early morning of March 8, 2022, the price of nickel topped US$100,000 a metric tonne. It was an unprecedented jump for nickel in recent times - the metal had traded between US$22,750 and US$25,260 a tonne in the previous month.The LME has said the nickel market became ""disorderly"" that morning and cancelled trades ""to take the market back to the last point in time at which the LME could be confident that the market was operating in an orderly way"". It was only the second time the bourse had done so in its history.However, several prominent investors have accused the bourse of favouring some customers over others in the chaos, with the likes of Paul Singer's Elliott Associates, Jane Street Global Trading and AQR Capital Management bringing legal action against the LME.Traders, brokers and clerks on the trading floor of the open outcry pit at the London Metal Exchange in February 2022.

Photo: Bloomberg&gt;The Managed Fund Association (MFA), a trade body representing some of the world's biggest hedge funds, separately filed a formal complaint with the LME over its handling of the crisis last year.As part of its Global Financial Stability report last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also weighed in, saying the LME needed to strengthen its governance mechanisms to avoid potential conflicts of interest.""Measures must be in place to ensure that the concentration of trading does not adversely impact free and fair markets,"" the IMF said last April.Citadel CEO Ken Griffin also has been critical, saying the LME's decision to cancel hours of trades last March was ""incomprehensively wrong"".""When you interfere with markets on an ex-post basis, it's incredibly destructive to the meaning of markets,"" Griffin said during a discussion at the Bloomberg Intelligence Market Structure conference in New York last April.The bourse, in response to lawsuits by Elliott and Jane Street, said in November that it acted to stave the market from a ""death spiral"" sparked by US$20 billion in margin calls.""They are lying. Nobody has to steal to save a market,"" AQR founder Clifford Asness, who has been one of the bourse's harshest critics, said in a tweet at the end of November about the LME's claims. ""They had cronies, they lied and cheated for them, and they got paid for lying and cheating for them.""AQR was among a group of hedge funds who filed new lawsuits against the bourse last week. AQR and several of those firms had sought to force the LME to turn over key communications around the decisions to cancel trades ahead of potential legal action, but those efforts were rejected by a London court last year.In addition to the lawsuits, the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's top financial watchdog, announced on March 3 that it had begun an enforcement inquiry into the LME's conduct, as well as its systems and controls, leading up to the suspension of trading last year.The inquiry could result in fines or a potential public censure and extend the controversy over the bourse's decision making during a time of crisis.In an independent review that concluded in January, the consulting firm Oliver Wyman found the bourse needed to tighten its rules to improve its ability to identify and prevent future market distortions, including adopting LME-specific position limits and revamping its existing accountability level framework to help address risks created by large positions, as well as monitoring ""significant risks"" in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.""Since events in the nickel market in March 2022 the LME and LME Clear have taken steps to enhance market confidence by introducing controls such as daily price limits and by improving OTC market transparency,"" a LME spokeswoman said.Elliott Associates, an arm of Paul Singer's Elliott Management, has sued the London Metal Exchange over its handling of last year's nickel crisis.

Photo: Reuters&gt;""The LME Group is committed to ensuring confidence in the metals market, and will continue to work with global regulators and market participants to support the long-term health, efficiency and resilience of the market as a whole,"" she said.The bourse is expected to outline its ongoing action plan for how it plans to further improve the market at the end of this month, including how it will address shortcomings raised by Oliver Wyman.The LME has already introduced a series of measures to try to avoid similar situations in the future, including upper and lower daily price limits for contracts that require metals to be physically delivered when a futures contract expires.Last summer, the LME began requiring its members to report their OTC positions on a weekly basis for these metals, including contracts for aluminium, copper, nickel, tin and zinc.Matthew Chamberlain, the London Metal Exchange CEO, meets the media during the LME Asia Week 2018 Seminar at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai in May 2018.

Photo: Xiaomei Chen&gt;Matthew Chamberlain, the LME CEO, has placed much of the blame on the lack of transparency at the time in off-exchange positions as one reason the bourse struggled to identify and manage the situation.However, some traders are chafing at the new rules, saying the price limits have contributed to narrow liquidity in nickel and other metals.Industry participants also are beginning to question whether the LME's nickel benchmark remains relevant as manufacturers shift to lower-grade forms of the metal.The LME's closely watched three-month contract is based on so-called Class 1 nickel, which is of a higher purity and increasingly plays a smaller role in the nickel market. The benchmark is still used as a reference point to price lower-grade nickel, in addition to nickel eligible for delivery to LME warehouses.In 2010, 57 per cent of nickel production was eligible for delivery to LME warehouses, according to BHP. Eligible nickel has shrunk to below 30 per cent and is expected to fall further, particularly because of uncertainty over the long-term status of Russian Class 1 metal, BHP said.In November, the LME decided against an outright ban on new deliveries of Russian metals in its warehouses, saying a ""material portion"" of the market still relies on Russian metals and it should ""not make or impose ethical judgments on the broader market"".However, the bourse has suspended some Russian metals, including nickel, from being used a collateral for margin accounts in its UK and US warehouses because of additional tariffs placed on Russian metals following the Ukraine war.""For now, the reality is that the global price discovery mechanism for this critical building block of the energy transition is not functioning well,"" Huw McKay, BHP's vice-president for market analysis and economics, said in a February 21 report. ""The basic tension is that the exchange where the benchmark price is set has become more removed from what is happening in the physical clearing market - China.""Last year, demand for stainless steel slowed abruptly, production of Class II nickel in countries, such as Indonesia, rose by double digit levels and the production surged of so-called intermediates, which have about 30 per cent to 60 per cent nickel content, BHP said.""This caught potential users of this material on the Chinese mainland on the hop - there was not enough capacity in place to absorb this discontinuous growth,"" McKay said. ""The surge in intermediates supply is the direct result of upstream innovation to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding battery value chain.""Aluminium ingots are seen outside a warehouse that stores London Metal Exchange stocks in Port Klang Free Zone, outside Kuala Lumpur in March 2015.

Photo: Reuters&gt;Some investors with exposure in China have sought to use the Shanghai Futures Exchange's three-month nickel contract as a peg in recent months as they try to hedge their risk. The Shanghai three-month contract was trading at US$26,000 a tonne last week - about US$3,000 more than the LME three-month contract.Overall volumes on the LME slipped 7 per cent to their lowest level in seven years in 2022, with nickel volumes falling even more sharply.The average daily volume of nickel trading was 35,661 lots in February, less than half the average daily volume of 85,639 lots in February 2022. A lot equals six metric tonnes of nickel.Meanwhile, competitors are looking to challenge the bourse's supremacy.Global Commodities Holdings, which is headed by former LME CEO Martin Abbott, plans to launch a competing spot trading platform for physical delivery of Class 1 nickel by the end of the first quarter, with the market opening during Singapore morning hours and closing at 6pm GMT.""There is a dislocation in the price discovery process for spot nickel, with the weight of futures transactions being too heavy for the existing settlement process,"" Abbott said in announcing the new platform in December. ""There is a very strong argument for separating spot price discovery from futures market activity, allowing both functions to thrive.""The CME Group, the operator of the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York and Chicago mercantile exchanges, has been considering launching its own nickel contract in the past year following the LME nickel chaos, with Reuters reporting last month that the bourse operator was considering using prices from the Global Commodities Holdings' platform for its new contract.""Investor confidence in the LME was badly shaken by the crisis and must be rebuilt,"" said Jennifer Han, the MFA's head of global regulatory affairs. ""Alternative asset managers require sound and predictable markets to deliver reliable returns for institutional investors such as pensions, especially during times of market volatility.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy for 2023. Jonathan Barratt, the CEO of CelsiusPro, suggests that investors should purchase copper during a downturn when there is a chance to do so. Referring to a shortage of resources and a significant requirement for copper in the renewable energy sector, Barratt told CNBC on March 2: “Our outlook for 2023 and 2024 is: when you get a dip in copper prices, it’s something to have in your portfolio. There is just not enough supply. And when we look at everything that’s happening in the environmental space, the renewables, everything, copper is a key component. So that’s a buy on dip at any chance you get.”Moody's Investors Service has revised its worldwide outlook for Metals &amp; Mining from negative to stable due to a slight improvement in business conditions in the US and Europe. Additionally, China's reopening of the economy has boosted demand for base metals, steel, and coal, further supporting this shift in outlook. Moody's stated that there are indications of an increase in demand for base metals, and their prices are being supported by limited inventories. The price of aluminum is expected to remain above the average historical level until early 2024 due to various factors, including its growing role in clean energy. Copper's prices will be supported by historically low inventories and ongoing industry supply disruptions. While nickel is expected to have a surplus in 2023, the electric vehicle market's gradual growth in demand will result in supply deficits. Finally, zinc prices will be supported by limited supply, low inventories, and high energy costs, which will push out high-cost producers.The copper industry is trying to become greener. The largest copper producers in the world have announced their plan to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. This initiative is aimed at attracting investment funds that prioritize environmental concerns. The International Copper Association (ICA) has projected a doubling of copper demand from 2020 levels to 50 million tonnes by 2050. Thus, it has set targets for its members to decrease their direct and indirect emissions by 30% to 40% by 2030, 70% to 80% by 2040, and ultimately reaching zero by 2050. The process of producing copper from scrap metal usually involves the use of electricity, making it a more straightforward process to reduce carbon emissions.Story continuesOn March 16, the European Union introduced legislation aimed at increasing the supply of metals critical to the energy transition, including copper and nickel, by categorizing them as critical raw materials. This move highlights the increasing political concerns regarding the long-term availability of these metals, as the rising demand for them due to global decarbonization efforts continues. Copper, which is one of the largest markets for industrial metals, was not included in the European Union's previous list of critical raw materials released in 2020. Due to its varied uses in manufacturing, construction, and industrial operations, it is widely considered a barometer of global economic activity. However, concerns are rising about potential deep shortages in the future due to its surging usage in electric vehicles and renewable energy. According to the CEO of Glencore Plc, Gary Nagle, copper production will need to nearly triple by 2040 to meet the targets for net-zero carbon emissions. This increase in demand is expected to cause a 15% surge in copper prices, pushing them above $10,000 per ton, where they will likely remain.To benefit from the boom in the copper industry, some of the best copper stocks to buy this year include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). Our Methodology For this article, we selected copper stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

(NYSE:BHP) is an example of a quality company at a moderate valuation that should deliver attractive long-term returns. We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”     Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023.    Suggested articles:13 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Now13 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners Disclosure: None. 10 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Secure your seat todayOn Monday, March 6, Claire Silver, a well-regarded non-fungible token (NFT) artist who uses artificial intelligence (AI) in her work, excitedly announced on Twitter and through an exclusive article in Variety that she would be exhibiting her art at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.According to Variety, her work was going to be presented at the Louvre ""courtesy of Superchief Gallery NFT"" and would premiere on March 21. The ""Superchief-Louvre show,"" as Variety wrote, would be a showing of her latest collection titled ""can i tell you a secret,"" which would be a series of 100 pieces created with AI.Silver, whose work has been auctioned off by Sotheby's and displayed in galleries around the world, also shared on Twitter that her one-of-one NFT artwork ""Love in the 4th Turning"" would be on exhibit at the Louvre.The news garnered praise and support from artists and collectors across the NFT space, who saw the exhibition as a sign of how digital art is gaining legitimacy in the traditional art world. Other museums, including Paris’ Centre Pompidou, the British Museum and the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) have recently embraced NFT art, so a showing at the Louvre initially seemed plausible.Yet, Silver's announcement was immediately met with skepticism online from members of the traditional art space – some suggested the exhibition would likely be at the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall situated near the Louvre museum, while others cruelly implied that Silver was duped by unrealistic expectations.On Friday, March 10, the Louvre confirmed that Silver would not be exhibiting there, leading to an outpouring of support for Silver by disappointed NFT enthusiasts left questioning how the embarrassing mixup happened.A case of miscommunication?When the Louvre finally set the record straight, Silver released (and deleted shortly thereafter) her version of the events. Later, she tweeted that she was ""unsure who misrepresented things.""Story continuesSuperchief Gallery, the NFT art gallery that was helping to facilitate the exhibiting of Claire's work, also posted a lengthy statement to Twitter sharing its version of events. It said people at Paris Blockchain Week, a blockchain summit to be held at the Carrousel du Louvre later this month, had lied about the details of the exhibition.""They told us, Paris Blockchain Week has rented (“privatized”) the Louvre Museum. They said that the Louvre Museum had an event rental area, for the conference, and that they were excited for us to come in as their “Art Partner,"" Superchief Gallery said in its statement.Shortly after, Superchief Gallery said its reps called Silver to share the news. The gallery contends that Paris Blockchain Week ""did not represent the details and facts in that meeting, or any meeting we had afterwards,"" only learning of the mixup on Twitter after the story about Silver's exhibition went viral.Superchief Gallery claims in its statement that Paris Blockchain Week overpromised. Ultimately, the gallery decided to cancel its participation in the event entirely.Paris Blockchain Week shared a different version of events. Organizers told CoinDesk that the location of the event was clearly expressed in the heading and in the text of the contract they presented. CoinDesk was able to view the contract over Zoom to verify.""It wouldn't have been in our interest to try to mislead in any way,"" the organizers said.The team said that in planning the details of the exhibition space they did not speak directly to Silver.""We never heard of her. And she never heard of us,"" they said, adding that in light of the mishap they recently connected with Silver and offered to work together next year.They shared that while the conference at large is being held at the Carrousel du Louvre, a fact that is splattered across their digital marketing materials, they are planning to host a private VIP dinner inside the Louvre museum, although they say this was never initially discussed with Silver or the third-party agency organizing on her behalf. They asserted that organizing the event came with ""very strict rules"" and that they have been ""extremely attentive"" to the images and text used to promote that event.Messages reviewed by CoinDesk suggest that representatives for Paris Blockchain Week discussed the private VIP event inside the Louvre museum days after Silver shared news about the exhibition.""Only after the Louvre contacted Claire did the agency start discussions about ways Claire’s artwork could be displayed at any point that could be deemed inside the Louvre museum – out of desperation. We looked into solutions to try to accommodate, but without knowing the full extent of promises that had already been made to Claire by the agent.""A spokesperson for global talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME), which represents Silver, told Variety in a statement that “it’s unfortunate that a third party misrepresented the details of this opportunity to our client Claire Silver. We fully support Claire and believe that she acted with integrity throughout this process.”It's unclear if a miscommunication occurred at some point during the negotiating process. Early, informal conversations about the opportunity took place at another event in Paris last month. However, the official contract was only signed between the two parties after Silver's public announcement had been made.Ultimately, it appears that neither Paris Blockchain Week nor Superchief Gallery intended to deceive Silver or the public deliberately. Neither party would have gained in the long term by lying about something that was so easily disproved, only to hurt Silver's upstanding reputation in the art world.The artist's burdenMany people on social media came to Silver's defense, noting that complex dynamics involving artists, agents, galleries, brokers and museums often exist. Ultimately, it appears that artists bear the brunt of the backlash from perceived failures, regardless of who else was involved or what happened behind the scenes.""A gallery’s success is measured by the success of its artists, and success for artists is determined by intricate measures of endorsement: Which important museum exhibitions have they been in? Which biennials?

Things went wrong at every level, and I was naive and flying too close to the sun to catch the issue myself.""She explained that she had reasons to believe the exhibition at the Louvre was legitimate – she noted that the Louvre is closed to the public on Tuesdays and that the proposed exhibition would have been on a Tuesday. ""I've seen artists use the museum as a setting for music videos etc., so it made sense to me that an exhibition was possible on a Tuesday,"" she said.Ultimately, she said she isn't placing the blame on any of the parties involved for the mishap.

96,66ba3874-a1e0-39be-92e0-efdfc1459f35,M,2023-03-18,"EMERGING MARKETS-Latam stocks fall, set for worst week in 9 months on global banking shocks",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emerging-markets-latam-stocks-fall-162705680.html,1679070425,STORY,['M'],"[By Shreyashi Sanyal March 17 (Reuters) - Latin American stocks fell on Friday at the end of a tumultuous week in which investors fled riskier assets on fears of a meltdown in the global financial sector, while Peru's sol emerged as a bright spot as copper prices held steady. The MSCI's index for Latin American equities declined 1.2%, as sentiment remained fragile after a roller-coaster week sparked by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States and concerns over the future of Swiss lender Credit Suisse despite a $54 billion lifeline from Switzerland's central bank. The Latam stock index has fallen in six of the last seven trading sessions and is set to clock its worst weekly performance since June. Brazil's Bovespa stock index, which houses some of central and south America's biggest lenders, shed 1.5%. Unibanco Holding SA, Banco do Brasil SA , Bradesco SA and BTG Pactual SA fell between 1.5% and 3.5%. Stocks in Latin America's second-largest economy, Mexico fell more than 1%. Mexico is also closely integrated with the U.S. economy, relying on it for a steady stream of remittances and trade. Most major Latin American currencies also slid against a weakening dollar even though markets now expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by only 25 basis points next week. Prior to the banking crisis, there was widespread speculation the U.S. central bank could deliver a 50-basis-point hike. Chile's peso slipped 1.6%, as investors assessed two tough weeks for the country that saw a magnitude 5.6 earthquake and the rejection of a proposed tax reform meant to finance key elements of President Gabriel Boric's leftist agenda. ""Rejection may lead to moderation in reforms, spending and tax burden. But this also reflects governability issues amid a highly fragmented Congress,"" Sebastian Rondeau, Latam economy and fixed income strategy director at Bank of America. ""While moderation is the most likely outcome of this setback, and thus positive, it could also put some pressure on the finance ministry in the future."" Brazil's real dropped 0.8%, while Mexico's peso fell 1.2%. Data showed Brazil's jobless rate rose to 8.4% in the three months through January, slightly above market expectations. Peru's sol, however, rose 0.2% taking its cues from higher prices for copper, the country's top export. Bolivian government bond spreads, a reflection of how risky investors see those securities, have opened to the widest in at least a decade, as the South American country battles against a sharp fall in foreign currency reserves. Among other emerging markets, Russia's central bank held its key interest rate at 7.5%, maintaining its hawkish rhetoric. The rouble fell.

Also, the focus on a 10-year gaming concession in Macau bodes well.In the past year, shares of Wynn Resorts have gained 34.9% against the industry’s fall of 4%. An upward revision in earnings estimates for 2023 reflects analysts’ optimism regarding the company’s growth potential. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has moved up 262.5% to 87 cents per share.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthWynn Resorts has been focusing on sports betting to drive growth.

WynnBET sports betting and online casino application have been operational in New Jersey for quite some time. Meanwhile, the company has strengthened third-party partnerships through agreements with the Detroit Lions, the Colorado Rockies and Cumulus Media. The company also collaborated with several engaging content creators to develop a unique sports-themed program.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company anticipates solid revenue generation on the back of new product features and a unique marketing campaign.

During fourth-quarter 2022, the company’s non-gaming business witnessed robust growth owing to strength across F&amp;B and retail.

The company emphasizes on introducing innovative non-gaming investments that drive increased tourism and strong shareholder returns.

The company remains optimistic and anticipates the initiatives to drive revenues in the upcoming periods.Wynn Resorts derives a solid share of revenues from Macau — the largest gaming destination in the world. Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the company is confident about prospects in Macau. Nevertheless, the worst seems to be over for the gaming industry in Macau as China’s economy is slowly gaining momentum. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Wynn Resorts (Macau) entered into a 10-year agreement with the Macau government for the renewal of its gaming concession, covering Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace Cotai. For 2023, the company expects capex related to concession commitments to be in the range of $50 - $220 million. The company is of the opinion that the proposed capex and programming will drive growth in the upcoming periods.Emphasis on the expansion of new markets bodes well. Wynn Resorts and Marjan, RAK Hospitality Holding recently reached an agreement to develop a multibillion-dollar integrated resort on the artificial Al Marjan Island in Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. This move marks Wynn Resorts’ foray into a new market. The resort is scheduled to open in 2026. This will mark the company’s first resort in the MENA region. The luxury hotel will have more than 1,000 rooms, top-notch shopping venues, a state-of-the-art meeting and convention facility, an exclusive spa and more than 10 restaurants and lounges. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company progressed with respect to the project design.

This marks Duke Energy Florida’s entry into floating solar projects, thus embarking on the emerging market that promises huge growth potential.Details of the ProjectThe pilot project will have an array of over 1800 floating solar modules with a generation capacity of 1-megawatt (MW). The project will be built on 2 acres of a water body surface. The expected completion time for construction is between five to six months.With this latest development, Duke Energy Florida takes a step forward in achieving its clean energy goals through innovative technologies. It also opens avenues for the company to expand operations in emerging floating solar technology.What’s Favoring Duke Energy in Floating Solar Projects?The switch to renewable sources of energy to curtail climatic effects is building up steam. Nations across the globe are striving to address combat greenhouse gas emission issues through innovative technologies. The requirement to make operations more eco-friendly is leading the way to evolving new methods of generating renewable energy.In this context, generating energy through solar projects on water bodies is one of the emerging technology and is gradually gaining momentum across the globe. The benefits of floating solar photovoltaic projects make them an interesting tool for renewable energy generation.No land usage, environmental aids like reduced evaporation and algae growth and increased efficiency of solar panels due to the cooling effect from water that eventually results in cost savings are some of the factors that must have attracted Duke Energy to scale up its floating solar projects.Per the projection from Transparency Market Research, the global floating solar market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% over the 2021-2031 period. This entails scope for substantial expansion for Duke Energy to foray into the floating solar market and develop more projects like the latest one.Story continuesUtilities Focus on Floating Solar ProjectsUtilities are steadily adopting various technologies to meet their climate goals.

107,5a764147-de54-3211-9c8a-22f48e0cadf5,PDCO,2023-03-18,The 7 Best Retirement Stocks for Anxious Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-retirement-stocks-anxious-232721498.html,1678836441,STORY,"['CVX', 'SQM', 'EPSN', 'TAIT', 'PDCO', 'PKG']","[Although any time is a good time to consider the best retirement stocks to buy, the present juncture sparks perhaps unprecedented urgency. With the implosion of SVB Financial Group, the ripple effect might not just center on one troubled enterprise. Rather, it’s quite possible that over the next several weeks and months, anxieties can impact multiple sectors, particularly risk-on assets.According to CNN Business, SVB Financial suffered a bank run due to a confluence of myriad headwinds. Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve spiked the benchmark interest rate, causing the money supply to tighten. As well, SVB held unrealized losses as the rising rates reduced the value of its bond portfolio. Then, venture capital dried up, forcing many technology startups to draw down funds held by SVB.Like it or not, investors seeking the best retirement stocks may have to tack on greater risk. At the time of writing, the U.S. 10-year Treasury Yield stands at 3.7%. Therefore, passive-income-generating equities need to yield at least that and offer some upside potential. It’s a tough ask to be sure. However, daring retirees may want to consider these best retirement stocks (under present circumstances).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCVXChevron$160.76EPSNEpsilon Energy$5.25SQMSociedad Química y Minera$78.85PDCOPatterson Companies$25.94TAITTaitron Components$3.64CIXCI Financial$13.89PKGPackaging Corp of America$131.35Chevron (CVX)Source: ©iStock.com/Murdock48At first glance, oil and natural gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might seem a risky idea for the best retirement stocks for anxious investors. After all, the broader political and ideological winds point heavily toward clean and renewable energy solutions. Unfortunately, renewables like wind and solar tend to be intermittent, only working when the sun is up or the wind is blowing. On the other hand, oil consistently generates power irrespective of outside forces (within reason).Story continuesFinancially as well, Chevron makes for an enticing market idea. First, the balance sheet enjoys several positive attributes, such as an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.62 times (ranked better than 67% of the field). Operationally, Chevron features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%, which pings above 75.62% of sector players. Also, its free cash flow (FCF) growth rate during the same period is 40.7%, outpacing almost 77% of the industry.Further, its net margin is 15%, within the top third of the hydrocarbon sector. It also supports the company’s forward yield of 3.78%. Notably, Chevron commands 37 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Lastly, Wall Street analysts peg CVX as a moderate buy, assigning it a $190.15 price target. This implies 19% upside potential.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)retirement stocks an older couple sitting on a dock and looking at a pamphletSource: ShutterstockA lesser-known energy firm, investors will do well to familiarize themselves with Epsilon Energy (NASDAQ:EPSN). An on-shore focused independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, gathering, and production of oil and gas reserves, Epsilon may be a bargain due to its forward relevancies. Still, it will require patience. Since the Jan. opener, EPSN gave up over 16% of its equity value.However, the underlying financials may be too attractive for market participants to ignore. For one thing, Epsilon enjoys excellent stability in the balance sheet. Most conspicuously, it carries zero debt, giving it incredible flexibility during these difficult times. Operationally, the hydrocarbon specialist features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.1%, above 75.62% of sector players.In addition, the company’s net margin stands at nearly 50%, outpacing over 92% of the field. Such robust profitability helps Epsilon carry a forward yield of 4.67%. Also, its payout ratio sits at 40.32%, facilitating confidence regarding yield stability. Right now, nobody covers EPSN. However, given its undervalued nature – with a price-earnings ratio of less than 4 times – EPSN could fly substantially higher.Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM)Vitamin DSource: ©iStock.com/EpicStockMediaA Chilean chemical company, Sociedad Quimica y Minera (NYSE:SQM) is the world’s biggest lithium producer. As the underlying commodity for lithium-ion batteries, lithium of course commands extraordinary relevance. Should the future of transportation be electric, then it will be vital for companies to secure lithium supply. As well, enterprises will need to find supplies from jurisdictionally friendly sources. SQM hits the nail on the head on both counts.To be fair, investment resource Gurufocus.com warns that SQM may be a possible value trap. That said, the financials on paper look incredibly attractive. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 81.3%, blowing past the competition. Also, its book growth rate during the same period pings at 36.4%, again dominating the field.On the bottom line, the mining firm features a trailing net margin of 36.39%. This helps undergird the company’s robust forward yield of 15.07%. Still, investors should be careful about its payout ratio, which flies up to 110.77%. For full disclosure, covering analysts peg SQM as a hold. That said, their average price target stands at $103, implying over 30% upside potential. Thus, it could be one of the best retirement stocks to buy.Patterson Companies (PDCO)an elderly couple jumping up in a white household. Cheap retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockA medical supplies conglomerate, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) primarily focuses on the business of veterinary and dental products. Fundamentally, neither arena will likely fall out of relevance anytime soon. Further, with millennials gravitating heavily toward pet ownership, the veterinary angle should be a long-term winner for PDCO, making it one of the best retirement stocks.To be sure, Patterson doesn’t have as many attractive fiscal attributes as its competitors. However, it does enjoy a solid balance sheet. In particular, its Altman Z-Score comes in at just above 4, indicating low bankruptcy risk. Also, the market prices PDCO at a forward multiple of 11.27. As a discount to earnings, Patterson ranks better than 75% of the competition.Looking at the bottom line, the company posts a trailing net margin of 3.08%, outpacing 61.45% of its peers. This helps bolster the company’s forward yield of 3.94%, which ranks much higher than the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Finally, analysts peg PDCO as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $31.79, implying over 20% upside potential.Taitron Components (TAIT)retirement stocks: a roadsign that says ""retirement ahead"". retirement stocksSource: ShutterstockBased in Valencia, California, Taitron Components (NASDAQ:TAIT) is a national distributor of brand-name electronic components and supplier of originally designed and manufactured (ODM) electronic components. Granted, the broader electronics market presents significant risks. However, over the long run, the normalization of the global economy should make TAIT one of the best retirement stocks.To be fair, Taitron will require some patience among market participants. However, it also wouldn’t be fair to classify TAIT as a purely speculative wager. For instance, the company benefits from a robust balance sheet. Most notably, it features no debt, again providing much flexibility during these troubles. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 14.37, indicating extremely low bankruptcy risk.On the bottom line, Taitron posts a trailing net margin of nearly 40%, outpacing almost 99% of the industry. Naturally, this top-level figure bolsters the company’s forward yield of 5.38%. Conspicuously, this comes in much higher than the technology sector’s average yield of 1.37%. Lastly, no analysts cover TAIT. However, the market prices shares at a trailing multiple of 6.31, which is extremely low. Thus, TAIT could fly much higher from here.CompX International (CIX)Source: InvestorPlace unless otherwise notedHeadquartered in Dallas, Texas, CompX International (NYSEAMERICAN:CIX) represents one of the lesser-known candidates for best retirement stocks. However, it plays a critical role in the background. According to its website, CompX is a diversified domestic manufacturer of engineered, quality components providing critical functionality to our customers’ products.Financially, the company presents a unignorably compelling profile. To begin with, CompX enjoys excellent stability in the balance sheet, particularly because it suffers no debt. As well, its Altman Z-Score pings at 10.14, indicating an extremely low risk of bankruptcy. Operationally, CompX features a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.6%, above nearly 74% of the industry.Notably, its net margin is 12.53%, outpacing almost 80% of its peers. In addition, this stat helps undergird CompX’s forward yield of 5.44%. That’s significantly higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Currently, no analyst covers CIX. However, given its low price-earnings ratio of 10.87 (compared to the sector median of 16.63), CIX can certainly swing higher.Packaging Corp of America (PKG)Pros and Cons of Retirement Income FundsSource: ShutterstockPerhaps the riskiest idea among the best retirement stocks, Packaging Corp of America (NYSE:PKG) specializes in custom corrugated solutions. Per the company’s website, corrugated packages offer the most environmentally friendly form of packaging available. That helps in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) department. Moreover, e-commerce may continue to rise in pertinence over the next several years.Following a sharp dip from the pandemic highs, e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales bounced conspicuously higher throughout 2022. Therefore, PKG might rise in relevance as e-commerce trudges forward despite the pressures of inflation. For full disclosure, analysts have a dim view of PKG, citing about a 5% downside risk. However, the upside of the e-commerce narrative could be the bigger catalyst.Financially, Packaging doesn’t feature outstandingly remarkable stats but decent metrics. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 7.3%, above nearly 59% of the industry. Its main strengths lie in its profitability, though. For instance, its net margin stands above 12%, beating 89% of the competition. Finally, Packaging carries a forward yield of 3.78%. Further, its payout ratio sits at 54.15%, which should be a sustainable yield.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the banking sector and the performance of dividend stocks in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. On March 10, federal regulators seized the assets of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which marked the largest bank failure since the global financial crisis of 2008. The collapse of SVB rattled investors’ confidence, as they started pulling their assets and deposits out of the bank soon after the crisis. According to a report by Bloomberg, top executives at 15 banks lost $267 million in wealth in the span of days following the collapse. The rippling effects of this fallout were felt in Europe as well.As investors registered their fears regarding the fallout, President Biden assured the nation of the banking system’s safety. He announced that investors will have access to their deposits whenever they need. In a joint statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg also attempted to boost investor confidence by offering loans to banks for up to one year. Here are some comments from the Fed:“This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.”Despite government intervention, bank stocks continue to fall in value. The S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index declined by 12.88% in the past five days, compared with a 2.28% return of the S&amp;P 500.Considering this slump in the banking sector, wealth advisors recommend putting money across different asset classes. Patrick Dwyer, managing director at NewEdge Wealth, spoke to CNBC about possible investment strategies to follow. He asserted that investors should put money into Treasuries and money markets as they can offer around 5% risk-free return during elevated interest rate periods. Similarly, Michael Zeuner, managing partner at WE Family Offices, also highlighted the importance of cash in this environment. He mentioned:Story continues“For so many years, cash was just not an interesting investment. It was paying zero, so people weren’t really paying attention to cash. Over the last year, as rates came up, and as the fear of a recession kicked in, a lot of families started to take some risk off the table. It went into cash. And so cash, from an investment perspective, [has] all of a sudden become a much more important part of the portfolio.”During such economic environments, the main focus of investors is to generate stable and regular income. Investing in dividend stocks is one of the best ways to achieve this goal as these companies reward investors with monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts.Keeping in mind the current situation of the banking sector, we will discuss the best bank dividend stocks in this article.

JPM, Bank of America Corp. BAC and The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK.Industry: Regional BanksLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2066546/3-major-regional-banks-worth-a-look-despite-svb-sbny-collapseThe Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is expected to witness muted NII and NIM performance on the contagion risk arising from the bank runs at two closed banks. Higher interest rates due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive hikes, which benefit the banks, are turning out to be counter-productive. Worsening asset quality, recessionary risk and a gradual slowdown in loan demand are other key headwinds.Yet, restructuring/expansion efforts and digitization will offer support. So, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. and The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. are worth taking a look.About the IndustryThe Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation's largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation's economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies.Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.Key Trends to Watch in the Major Regional Banks IndustryHawkish Fed &amp; Bank Run Risk: The Fed's ultra-aggressive monetary policy over the past year led the rates to reach a 15-year high level. The rising interest rates are a boon for major regional banks and they reaped substantial benefits in form of higher NIM and NII in 2022. But faster rate hikes after a prolonged period of low rates have their fall out, as seen in the past week with the collapse of two S&amp;P 500 banks - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. This shook the confidence of the investors and depositors amid fears of contagion.Story continuesThe central bank has announced a new expansive emergency lending program – the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) – in an effort to limit the contagion risk. Yet, there are chances that other banks with unrealized losses or uninsured depositors could be at risk. In another blow to the U.S. banking sector, Moody's downgraded its outlook on the entire sector to negative, reflecting the worsening operating backdrop following bank runs at the two collapsed banks.While the Fed is likely to keep increasing rates in the near term to control inflation, major regional banks are less likely to witness much improvement in NII going forward as funding costs rise. This will also put pressure on NIM in the upcoming period.Near-Term Recession Risk: The Fed's aggressive monetary policy has intensified fears of a ""mild"" recession in the second half of 2023. Even the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections announced in December 2022 indicates the U.S. economy will slow down considerably this year, with just 0.5% growth. While major regional banks are better equipped to face economic downturn owing to the reforms introduced subsequent to the 2008 financial crisis, the lending scenario is likely to weaken as demand for loans gradually wanes.Asset Quality Metrics Touching Pre-Pandemic Level: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the coronavirus mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from the government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement.Yet, given the present macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds, and rise in loan demand, major regional banks are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers will help keep banks' asset quality manageable, several credit quality metrics are slowly creeping up toward pre-pandemic levels.Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking several strategic steps to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. Restructuring of operations is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability.Banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services as the demand for these witnessed a substantial rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Major regional banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into the U.K. and China.Banks are re-evaluating their business structure to improve operating efficiency. The main goal is to simplify operations and do away with non-core, unprofitable ones.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #151, which places it in the bottom 39% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates underperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of discouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Since April 2022-end, the industry's earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 8.5% lower.Before we present a few major bank stocks that you may keep an eye on despite deteriorating operating environment on bank run risk and rising interest rates, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has underperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past two years. While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 19.4% over the period, the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has declined 2.8% and the Zacks Finance sector has fallen 8.5%.Industry's ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 1.70X. This compares with the highest level of 2.53X, lowest of 1.21X, and median of 2.10X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&amp;P 500 composite is 9.70X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.53X. This is above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry's ratio.3 Major Regional Banks to WatchJPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank (in terms of assets), JPMorgan has operations in more than 60 countries. The company is expected to benefit from the higher interest rate environment. Given the ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance and decent loan demand, the company is projecting NII (managed basis) to be approximately $73 billion for 2023.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) bank is also taking measures to further diversify operations. In September 2022, the company announced a deal to acquire Renovite. In December 2022, it acquired a 49% stake in Greece-based Viva Wallet, while in August, the company completed the deal to buy Global Shares. These, along with several others, are expected to keep supporting the bank's plan to diversify revenues and expand the fee income product suite and consumer bank digitally.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Also, JPM is expanding its footprint in new regions and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. Apart from enhancing market share, the strategy will help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. Apart from this, the company launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and continues to expand investment banking and asset management operations in China.JPMorgan remains focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise and strengthening its loan portfolio. Despite a tough operating backdrop, deposits and loan balances have remained solid over the past several years. As of Dec 31, 2022, the loans to deposits ratio was 49%.JPMorgan has a solid capital deployment plan. Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the bank kept the quarterly dividend unchanged at $1 per share. Also, to maintain higher future capital requirements amid macroeconomic challenges, the company has temporarily suspended share repurchases. Nonetheless, the bank has resumed share buyback effective first-quarter 2023 as it reached the CET1 ratio target of 13% earlier than expected. The company intends to repurchase shares worth $12 billion this year. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain current capital deployments.With a market cap of $396.2 billion, JPMorgan is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Also, analysts are bullish on the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved marginally upward for 2023 over the past 30 days. The stock has rallied 8.6% over the past six months.Bank of America: With total assets worth $3.05 trillion as of Dec 31, 2022, Bank of America is one of the largest financial holding companies in the United States. The company provides a diverse range of banking and non-banking financial services and products across North America and globally.BAC is well-poised to benefit from higher interest rates. The company's balance sheet is highly asset-sensitive, and rising rates will support top-line growth. Provided loans grow modestly and rates in the forward curve materialize, management projects NII in the first quarter of 2023 to be around $14.4 billion.Bank of America continues to align its banking center network according to customer needs. These initiatives, along with the success of Zelle and Erica, have enabled it to improve digital offerings and cross-sell several products, including mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The acquisition of Axia Technologies has further strengthened its healthcare payments business.Prudent cost management continues to support this Zacks Rank #3 bank's financials. Its expense-saving plan – Project New BAC (launched in 2011) – helped improve overall efficiency. Over the last several quarters, the company has incurred an average of $15 billion in expenses, despite undertaking strategic growth initiatives. The company expects expenses of $16 billion in the first quarter of 2023, inclusive of seasonally elevated payroll taxes.Post the clearance of the 2022 stress test, Bank of America announced a dividend hike of 4.8% in July 2022, following a 17% hike in July 2021. In October 2021, the company's share repurchase plan of $25 billion was renewed. In 2022, it returned $12 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividend payouts.With a market cap of $230.2 billion, Bank of America's efforts to improve revenues, strong balance sheet and expansion into new markets will support financials. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for 2023. Over the past six months, shares of BAC have lost 17.9%.BNY Mellon: Operating in 35 countries, BNY Mellon provides various products and services to individuals and institutions. Its global client base consists of financial institutions, corporations, government agencies, endowments and foundations, and high-net-worth individuals.Higher interest rates will support BNY Mellon's top-line growth. While the company's net interest revenues (NIR) and NIM declined in 2020 and 2021, both rebounded solidly in 2022. With more interest rate hikes expected this year, NIR and NIM are expected to continue improving. Management anticipates NIR to grow roughly 20% this year.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been trying to gain a foothold in foreign markets and is undertaking several growth initiatives (including launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts). In 2022, non-U.S. revenues constituted 36% of total revenues. Its international revenues are expected to continue improving as the demand for personalized services rises globally.Following the clearance of the 2022 stress test, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 9% to 37 cents per share in July. While BNY Mellon stopped share repurchases to meet the higher capital requirements, it announced a new share buyback program worth $5 billion, effective Jan 1, 2023. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain efficient capital deployments.BNY Mellon has a market cap of $36.6 billion. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 1.3% upward for 2023. In the past six months, the stock has dipped 0.5%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The 146-year-old bourse suffered a sharp fall in its annual trading volumes following the episode last March and could soon see competition from a new UK-based platform for physical delivery of nickel, which is used in everything from stainless steel to batteries for electric vehicles.""Reform of the LME's metal delivery rules is long overdue,"" Australian mining giant BHP said in its half-year economic outlook last month. ""The LME short squeeze episode highlighted vulnerabilities that had been building for years.""A big test for the bourse will come on Monday when nickel trading will resume during Asian business hours, starting at 9am HKT (1am GMT), following a pause of more than a year.Exchange officials hope the extended hours will expand the available liquidity in the metal and mark another important return to normality after a year of soul-searching and reforms designed to restore confidence in the market.In early March last year, the price of nickel and other commodities surged on concerns of shortages following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions in reaction to the war.Story continuesIn a three-day period, the price of nickel jumped more than 270 per cent on the LME, triggering nearly US$16 billion in margin calls by bourse members as nickel producers and traders covered their short positions.The rapid price movement squeezed dozens of short-sellers, including the world's largest stainless steel producer, Tsingshan Holding Group of China.By the early morning of March 8, 2022, the price of nickel topped US$100,000 a metric tonne. It was an unprecedented jump for nickel in recent times - the metal had traded between US$22,750 and US$25,260 a tonne in the previous month.The LME has said the nickel market became ""disorderly"" that morning and cancelled trades ""to take the market back to the last point in time at which the LME could be confident that the market was operating in an orderly way"". It was only the second time the bourse had done so in its history.However, several prominent investors have accused the bourse of favouring some customers over others in the chaos, with the likes of Paul Singer's Elliott Associates, Jane Street Global Trading and AQR Capital Management bringing legal action against the LME.Traders, brokers and clerks on the trading floor of the open outcry pit at the London Metal Exchange in February 2022.

Photo: Bloomberg&gt;The Managed Fund Association (MFA), a trade body representing some of the world's biggest hedge funds, separately filed a formal complaint with the LME over its handling of the crisis last year.As part of its Global Financial Stability report last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also weighed in, saying the LME needed to strengthen its governance mechanisms to avoid potential conflicts of interest.""Measures must be in place to ensure that the concentration of trading does not adversely impact free and fair markets,"" the IMF said last April.Citadel CEO Ken Griffin also has been critical, saying the LME's decision to cancel hours of trades last March was ""incomprehensively wrong"".""When you interfere with markets on an ex-post basis, it's incredibly destructive to the meaning of markets,"" Griffin said during a discussion at the Bloomberg Intelligence Market Structure conference in New York last April.The bourse, in response to lawsuits by Elliott and Jane Street, said in November that it acted to stave the market from a ""death spiral"" sparked by US$20 billion in margin calls.""They are lying. Nobody has to steal to save a market,"" AQR founder Clifford Asness, who has been one of the bourse's harshest critics, said in a tweet at the end of November about the LME's claims. ""They had cronies, they lied and cheated for them, and they got paid for lying and cheating for them.""AQR was among a group of hedge funds who filed new lawsuits against the bourse last week. AQR and several of those firms had sought to force the LME to turn over key communications around the decisions to cancel trades ahead of potential legal action, but those efforts were rejected by a London court last year.In addition to the lawsuits, the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's top financial watchdog, announced on March 3 that it had begun an enforcement inquiry into the LME's conduct, as well as its systems and controls, leading up to the suspension of trading last year.The inquiry could result in fines or a potential public censure and extend the controversy over the bourse's decision making during a time of crisis.In an independent review that concluded in January, the consulting firm Oliver Wyman found the bourse needed to tighten its rules to improve its ability to identify and prevent future market distortions, including adopting LME-specific position limits and revamping its existing accountability level framework to help address risks created by large positions, as well as monitoring ""significant risks"" in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.""Since events in the nickel market in March 2022 the LME and LME Clear have taken steps to enhance market confidence by introducing controls such as daily price limits and by improving OTC market transparency,"" a LME spokeswoman said.Elliott Associates, an arm of Paul Singer's Elliott Management, has sued the London Metal Exchange over its handling of last year's nickel crisis.

Photo: Reuters&gt;""The LME Group is committed to ensuring confidence in the metals market, and will continue to work with global regulators and market participants to support the long-term health, efficiency and resilience of the market as a whole,"" she said.The bourse is expected to outline its ongoing action plan for how it plans to further improve the market at the end of this month, including how it will address shortcomings raised by Oliver Wyman.The LME has already introduced a series of measures to try to avoid similar situations in the future, including upper and lower daily price limits for contracts that require metals to be physically delivered when a futures contract expires.Last summer, the LME began requiring its members to report their OTC positions on a weekly basis for these metals, including contracts for aluminium, copper, nickel, tin and zinc.Matthew Chamberlain, the London Metal Exchange CEO, meets the media during the LME Asia Week 2018 Seminar at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai in May 2018.

Photo: Xiaomei Chen&gt;Matthew Chamberlain, the LME CEO, has placed much of the blame on the lack of transparency at the time in off-exchange positions as one reason the bourse struggled to identify and manage the situation.However, some traders are chafing at the new rules, saying the price limits have contributed to narrow liquidity in nickel and other metals.Industry participants also are beginning to question whether the LME's nickel benchmark remains relevant as manufacturers shift to lower-grade forms of the metal.The LME's closely watched three-month contract is based on so-called Class 1 nickel, which is of a higher purity and increasingly plays a smaller role in the nickel market. The benchmark is still used as a reference point to price lower-grade nickel, in addition to nickel eligible for delivery to LME warehouses.In 2010, 57 per cent of nickel production was eligible for delivery to LME warehouses, according to BHP. Eligible nickel has shrunk to below 30 per cent and is expected to fall further, particularly because of uncertainty over the long-term status of Russian Class 1 metal, BHP said.In November, the LME decided against an outright ban on new deliveries of Russian metals in its warehouses, saying a ""material portion"" of the market still relies on Russian metals and it should ""not make or impose ethical judgments on the broader market"".However, the bourse has suspended some Russian metals, including nickel, from being used a collateral for margin accounts in its UK and US warehouses because of additional tariffs placed on Russian metals following the Ukraine war.""For now, the reality is that the global price discovery mechanism for this critical building block of the energy transition is not functioning well,"" Huw McKay, BHP's vice-president for market analysis and economics, said in a February 21 report. ""The basic tension is that the exchange where the benchmark price is set has become more removed from what is happening in the physical clearing market - China.""Last year, demand for stainless steel slowed abruptly, production of Class II nickel in countries, such as Indonesia, rose by double digit levels and the production surged of so-called intermediates, which have about 30 per cent to 60 per cent nickel content, BHP said.""This caught potential users of this material on the Chinese mainland on the hop - there was not enough capacity in place to absorb this discontinuous growth,"" McKay said. ""The surge in intermediates supply is the direct result of upstream innovation to meet the needs of the rapidly expanding battery value chain.""Aluminium ingots are seen outside a warehouse that stores London Metal Exchange stocks in Port Klang Free Zone, outside Kuala Lumpur in March 2015.

Photo: Reuters&gt;Some investors with exposure in China have sought to use the Shanghai Futures Exchange's three-month nickel contract as a peg in recent months as they try to hedge their risk. The Shanghai three-month contract was trading at US$26,000 a tonne last week - about US$3,000 more than the LME three-month contract.Overall volumes on the LME slipped 7 per cent to their lowest level in seven years in 2022, with nickel volumes falling even more sharply.The average daily volume of nickel trading was 35,661 lots in February, less than half the average daily volume of 85,639 lots in February 2022. A lot equals six metric tonnes of nickel.Meanwhile, competitors are looking to challenge the bourse's supremacy.Global Commodities Holdings, which is headed by former LME CEO Martin Abbott, plans to launch a competing spot trading platform for physical delivery of Class 1 nickel by the end of the first quarter, with the market opening during Singapore morning hours and closing at 6pm GMT.""There is a dislocation in the price discovery process for spot nickel, with the weight of futures transactions being too heavy for the existing settlement process,"" Abbott said in announcing the new platform in December. ""There is a very strong argument for separating spot price discovery from futures market activity, allowing both functions to thrive.""The CME Group, the operator of the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York and Chicago mercantile exchanges, has been considering launching its own nickel contract in the past year following the LME nickel chaos, with Reuters reporting last month that the bourse operator was considering using prices from the Global Commodities Holdings' platform for its new contract.""Investor confidence in the LME was badly shaken by the crisis and must be rebuilt,"" said Jennifer Han, the MFA's head of global regulatory affairs. ""Alternative asset managers require sound and predictable markets to deliver reliable returns for institutional investors such as pensions, especially during times of market volatility.""This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy for 2023. Jonathan Barratt, the CEO of CelsiusPro, suggests that investors should purchase copper during a downturn when there is a chance to do so. Referring to a shortage of resources and a significant requirement for copper in the renewable energy sector, Barratt told CNBC on March 2: “Our outlook for 2023 and 2024 is: when you get a dip in copper prices, it’s something to have in your portfolio. There is just not enough supply. And when we look at everything that’s happening in the environmental space, the renewables, everything, copper is a key component. So that’s a buy on dip at any chance you get.”Moody's Investors Service has revised its worldwide outlook for Metals &amp; Mining from negative to stable due to a slight improvement in business conditions in the US and Europe. Additionally, China's reopening of the economy has boosted demand for base metals, steel, and coal, further supporting this shift in outlook. Moody's stated that there are indications of an increase in demand for base metals, and their prices are being supported by limited inventories. The price of aluminum is expected to remain above the average historical level until early 2024 due to various factors, including its growing role in clean energy. Copper's prices will be supported by historically low inventories and ongoing industry supply disruptions. While nickel is expected to have a surplus in 2023, the electric vehicle market's gradual growth in demand will result in supply deficits. Finally, zinc prices will be supported by limited supply, low inventories, and high energy costs, which will push out high-cost producers.The copper industry is trying to become greener. The largest copper producers in the world have announced their plan to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. This initiative is aimed at attracting investment funds that prioritize environmental concerns. The International Copper Association (ICA) has projected a doubling of copper demand from 2020 levels to 50 million tonnes by 2050. Thus, it has set targets for its members to decrease their direct and indirect emissions by 30% to 40% by 2030, 70% to 80% by 2040, and ultimately reaching zero by 2050. The process of producing copper from scrap metal usually involves the use of electricity, making it a more straightforward process to reduce carbon emissions.Story continuesOn March 16, the European Union introduced legislation aimed at increasing the supply of metals critical to the energy transition, including copper and nickel, by categorizing them as critical raw materials. This move highlights the increasing political concerns regarding the long-term availability of these metals, as the rising demand for them due to global decarbonization efforts continues. Copper, which is one of the largest markets for industrial metals, was not included in the European Union's previous list of critical raw materials released in 2020. Due to its varied uses in manufacturing, construction, and industrial operations, it is widely considered a barometer of global economic activity. However, concerns are rising about potential deep shortages in the future due to its surging usage in electric vehicles and renewable energy. According to the CEO of Glencore Plc, Gary Nagle, copper production will need to nearly triple by 2040 to meet the targets for net-zero carbon emissions. This increase in demand is expected to cause a 15% surge in copper prices, pushing them above $10,000 per ton, where they will likely remain.To benefit from the boom in the copper industry, some of the best copper stocks to buy this year include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). Our Methodology For this article, we selected copper stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023Photo by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashBest Copper Stocks To Buy For 202310.

While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”     Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023.    Suggested articles:13 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Now13 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners Disclosure: None. 10 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Secure your seat todayOn Monday, March 6, Claire Silver, a well-regarded non-fungible token (NFT) artist who uses artificial intelligence (AI) in her work, excitedly announced on Twitter and through an exclusive article in Variety that she would be exhibiting her art at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.According to Variety, her work was going to be presented at the Louvre ""courtesy of Superchief Gallery NFT"" and would premiere on March 21. The ""Superchief-Louvre show,"" as Variety wrote, would be a showing of her latest collection titled ""can i tell you a secret,"" which would be a series of 100 pieces created with AI.Silver, whose work has been auctioned off by Sotheby's and displayed in galleries around the world, also shared on Twitter that her one-of-one NFT artwork ""Love in the 4th Turning"" would be on exhibit at the Louvre.The news garnered praise and support from artists and collectors across the NFT space, who saw the exhibition as a sign of how digital art is gaining legitimacy in the traditional art world. Other museums, including Paris’ Centre Pompidou, the British Museum and the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) have recently embraced NFT art, so a showing at the Louvre initially seemed plausible.Yet, Silver's announcement was immediately met with skepticism online from members of the traditional art space – some suggested the exhibition would likely be at the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall situated near the Louvre museum, while others cruelly implied that Silver was duped by unrealistic expectations.On Friday, March 10, the Louvre confirmed that Silver would not be exhibiting there, leading to an outpouring of support for Silver by disappointed NFT enthusiasts left questioning how the embarrassing mixup happened.A case of miscommunication?When the Louvre finally set the record straight, Silver released (and deleted shortly thereafter) her version of the events. Later, she tweeted that she was ""unsure who misrepresented things.""Story continuesSuperchief Gallery, the NFT art gallery that was helping to facilitate the exhibiting of Claire's work, also posted a lengthy statement to Twitter sharing its version of events. It said people at Paris Blockchain Week, a blockchain summit to be held at the Carrousel du Louvre later this month, had lied about the details of the exhibition.""They told us, Paris Blockchain Week has rented (“privatized”) the Louvre Museum. They said that the Louvre Museum had an event rental area, for the conference, and that they were excited for us to come in as their “Art Partner,"" Superchief Gallery said in its statement.Shortly after, Superchief Gallery said its reps called Silver to share the news. The gallery contends that Paris Blockchain Week ""did not represent the details and facts in that meeting, or any meeting we had afterwards,"" only learning of the mixup on Twitter after the story about Silver's exhibition went viral.Superchief Gallery claims in its statement that Paris Blockchain Week overpromised. Ultimately, the gallery decided to cancel its participation in the event entirely.Paris Blockchain Week shared a different version of events. Organizers told CoinDesk that the location of the event was clearly expressed in the heading and in the text of the contract they presented. CoinDesk was able to view the contract over Zoom to verify.""It wouldn't have been in our interest to try to mislead in any way,"" the organizers said.The team said that in planning the details of the exhibition space they did not speak directly to Silver.""We never heard of her. And she never heard of us,"" they said, adding that in light of the mishap they recently connected with Silver and offered to work together next year.They shared that while the conference at large is being held at the Carrousel du Louvre, a fact that is splattered across their digital marketing materials, they are planning to host a private VIP dinner inside the Louvre museum, although they say this was never initially discussed with Silver or the third-party agency organizing on her behalf. They asserted that organizing the event came with ""very strict rules"" and that they have been ""extremely attentive"" to the images and text used to promote that event.Messages reviewed by CoinDesk suggest that representatives for Paris Blockchain Week discussed the private VIP event inside the Louvre museum days after Silver shared news about the exhibition.""Only after the Louvre contacted Claire did the agency start discussions about ways Claire’s artwork could be displayed at any point that could be deemed inside the Louvre museum – out of desperation. We looked into solutions to try to accommodate, but without knowing the full extent of promises that had already been made to Claire by the agent.""A spokesperson for global talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME), which represents Silver, told Variety in a statement that “it’s unfortunate that a third party misrepresented the details of this opportunity to our client Claire Silver. We fully support Claire and believe that she acted with integrity throughout this process.”It's unclear if a miscommunication occurred at some point during the negotiating process. Early, informal conversations about the opportunity took place at another event in Paris last month. However, the official contract was only signed between the two parties after Silver's public announcement had been made.Ultimately, it appears that neither Paris Blockchain Week nor Superchief Gallery intended to deceive Silver or the public deliberately. Neither party would have gained in the long term by lying about something that was so easily disproved, only to hurt Silver's upstanding reputation in the art world.The artist's burdenMany people on social media came to Silver's defense, noting that complex dynamics involving artists, agents, galleries, brokers and museums often exist. Ultimately, it appears that artists bear the brunt of the backlash from perceived failures, regardless of who else was involved or what happened behind the scenes.""A gallery’s success is measured by the success of its artists, and success for artists is determined by intricate measures of endorsement: Which important museum exhibitions have they been in? Which biennials? Have the right collectors caught on?"" wrote ARTNews in 2020.I can only imagine. Being of the business side of working with artists, this is a very tragic yet not totally uncommon occurrence. Your response is well thought out, and you earned a follow and respect from me. Sending you all the good vibes 💚— 𝔹ℝ𝔸ℕ𝔻𝕆ℕ 𝔽ℝ𝔸ℕ𝕂𝔼𝕃 (@brandontour) March 10, 2023I respect her work.It's very likely that she is being lied to, which happens a lot for pumping.I've lost many artist friends who didn't mind the lies and misleading PR, mostly because profit.— ᴊᴏᴀɴɪᴇ ʟᴇᴍᴇʀᴄɪᴇʀ (@JoanieLemercier) March 10, 2023You can mute or block those people just giving you negativity.Anyone can make a mistake, or be taken advantage of in this space. Either they intentionally misinformed you or they got backlash for putting an AI artist at The Louvre because the hate is real. In the end they can… https://t.co/vBzeCHzp8y— Eclectika 🏳️‍🌈 (@Eclectika_12) March 13, 2023Claire told CoinDesk that she has taken a step back from the situation to preserve her well-being.""I'm way out of my depth and have removed myself accordingly. Things went wrong at every level, and I was naive and flying too close to the sun to catch the issue myself.""She explained that she had reasons to believe the exhibition at the Louvre was legitimate – she noted that the Louvre is closed to the public on Tuesdays and that the proposed exhibition would have been on a Tuesday. ""I've seen artists use the museum as a setting for music videos etc., so it made sense to me that an exhibition was possible on a Tuesday,"" she said.Ultimately, she said she isn't placing the blame on any of the parties involved for the mishap. ""I respect what [Paris Blockchain Week] does for digital artists, and would have loved to exhibit at the [Carrousel du Louvre] if it was under any other context. I also deeply respect and am extremely grateful to Superchief for fighting harder for AI collaborative artists than anyone in the space.""]"

This will influence 14 S&amp;P 500 companies. The current GICS structure includes 11 sectors, which will remain unchanged.The reclassification of firms will occur across five GICS sectors. These are consumer discretionary, consumer staples, financials, industrials, and information technology. The financials and information technology sectors will see the largest impact. UBS estimates financials weight in the S&amp;P 500 will increase by 2.7% and information technology will decline by 3.2%.Moreover, food, household, and personal care products firms like Target TGT, Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR will leave the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY and join the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF XLP The new discount stores companies will constitute about 6.5% of the new staples sector, per the UBS article.Below we describe the likely impact of this reclassification on concerned sector ETFs.Sector ETFs in FocusFinance &amp; Information TechnologyFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF takes the spotlight.Eight S&amp;P 500 stocks from the data processing &amp; outsourced services subindustry will move to the newly created transaction and payment processing services subindustry in the financials sector.The securities include Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc., Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information, Global Payments Inc., FleetCor Technologies Inc. and Jack Henry &amp; Associates Inc. Each of the stocks will have larger weightings within their new sector.Visa V, Mastercard MA, and PayPal PYPL will form roughly 17% of the financials sector, larger than Berkshire Hathaway's weight (currently the largest component), per the article published on UBS.com. Digital payments have been in the front and center of consumer behavior lately.Apart from showing an increased interest in online shopping, customers are resorting to digital payments to clear their bills. Even, merchants and utility providers are increasingly advocating the same. In the ongoing earnings reporting season, PayPal beat earnings estimate while Mastercard and Visa beat on both lines.Story continuesHowever, the reclassification makes XLF a bit growth-centric. Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, on average, trade at about a 90% premium to the financials sector on a consensus forward P/E basis. This is a negative for the sector if rates continue to rise.With pure high-growth technology stocks gaining precedence in the fund, the fund will likely lose its relative value quotient. Rising rate environment will likely prove to be riskier for Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK).ConsumerConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) is another sector ETF that deserves definite mention. UBS estimates that the weight of the consumer discretionary sector in the S&amp;P 500 will likely fall by 0.5% and consumer staples will likely gain by 0.5%. Dollar Tree and Target beat on both lines in latest earnings season while Dollar General offered mixed results. UBS indicated that valuation of those discount retailers was at par with consumer staples. Hence, the impact would be minimal. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY rather now became slightly richly-valued.IndustrialsAutomatic Data Processing ADP, Broadridge Financial Solutions BR and Paychex Inc. PAYX come from industry and sectors that have upbeat Zacks ranks. These outsourcing stocks will join Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) with larger weights, post reclassification. The valuation of the sector ETF will go up slightly as ADP and PAYX trade at around 35% premium to XLI.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The program is a shared and interoperable digital technology platform, which aims to counter infrastructural headwinds, such as lack of secure connectivity or low smartphone usage, often encountered while digitizing rural communities.As a result of the abovementioned deal, Digitt+, the country’s agri-fintech company, backed by AFT, will be entrusted to introduce Mastercard Commerce Pass across Pakistan. Commerce Pass is a digital payment solution that falls under MA’s Community Pass suite.An offline and stored-value account product, Commerce Pass paves way for the safe storage and transfer of digital funds. Thereby, consumers and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (""MSMEs"") of Pakistan are made aware of digitization benefits and the hassles of cash storage and transferring are minimized.The recent tie-up reinforces Mastercard’s sincere efforts to integrate digital solutions within the underserved agricultural markets of the country. And the expansive footprint of Digitt+ across the agricultural sector of Pakistan makes it an apt partner to complement MA’s endeavor.The move seems to be a time opportune one as a significant portion of Pakistan’s population is employed in agriculture and widespread measures are being adopted across the globe to integrate digitization in every sphere of life. But the agricultural sector of Pakistan grapples with ineffective infrastructure thereby creating roadblocks in the way of financial service providers to cater to agricultural workers. Deemed to be a perfect fit in the prevailing scenario, Commerce Pass will offer a record of transactions that will make availing credit and other financial services easier for the country’s agricultural employees.  The Mastercard solution is expected to offer financial flexibility to a considerable population of Pakistan that resides in rural areas and resorts to informal lending channels.Story continuesMastercard follows a public-private partnerships strategy in Pakistan and works in unison with the government or private sector companies to infuse digitization across various sectors of the economy. Last year, MA collaborated with LMK Resources Pakistan (Private) Limited (""LMKR"") to execute the first open-loop payment solution, powered by MA’s advanced technology, across the country’s transit system. The move was undertaken to infuse digitization within the country’s travel sector. By virtue of such remarkable initiatives, Mastercard occupies a significant share of the digital payments market in Pakistan.Shares of Mastercard have gained 10.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 5.2% rally.

121,86196648-98a5-3a70-8550-b54b093f6ab4,QCOM,2023-03-18,Investors Heavily Search QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-qualcomm-incorporated-130001828.html,1679058001,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Qualcomm (QCOM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned -7.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3% change. During this period, the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry, which Qualcomm falls in, has lost 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Qualcomm is expected to post earnings of $2.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.51 points to a change of -24.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.49 indicates a change of +20.8% from what Qualcomm is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Qualcomm.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for QCOM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Qualcomm, the consensus sales estimate of $9.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -18.8%. The $37.99 billion and $43.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -14.1% and +15.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryQualcomm reported revenues of $9.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.7%. EPS of $2.37 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.56 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.12%. The EPS surprise was +0.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Qualcomm is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Qualcomm. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, continued demand for vehicles and robust product lineup are set to fuel sales volumes of Toyota.To capitalize on the accelerated global shift to green cars, the auto giant is deepening focus on manufacturing electric and fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company’s product competitiveness.

127,cd19e807-0bb9-3953-b080-96e554c6e951,MDT,2023-03-18,Should Income Investors Look At Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) Before Its Ex-Dividend?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/income-investors-look-medtronic-plc-121417696.html,1679141657,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Medtronic investors that purchase the stock on or after the 23rd of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of April.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.68 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.72 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Medtronic has a trailing yield of approximately 3.5% on its current stock price of $78.29. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Medtronic's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Medtronic can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 87% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be worried about the risk of a drop in earnings. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 85% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's positive to see that Medtronic's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's not encouraging to see that Medtronic's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share. A payout ratio of 87% looks like a tacit signal from management that reinvestment opportunities in the business are low. In line with limited earnings growth in recent years, this is not the most appealing combination.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Medtronic has increased its dividend at approximately 10% a year on average.Final TakeawayIs Medtronic worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have barely grown, and although Medtronic paid out over half its earnings and free cash flow last year, the payout ratios are within a normal range for most companies. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Medtronic from a dividend perspective.Curious what other investors think of Medtronic?

The system includes the Sphere-9 Catheter and the Affera Prism-1 Mapping Software. The Affera Mapping and Ablation System will be commercially available in Europe and is investigational in the United States in the first half of 2023.The Affera Mapping and Ablation System is the first of its kind, all-in-one Sphere-9 Catheter with pulsed-field ablation, radiofrequency, and high-density mapping combined with an intuitive mapping and navigation platform.The recent development will likely fortify Medtronic’s Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio.More on the NewsThe Sphere-9 Catheter, with the integrated mapping and navigation system, rapidly generates sophisticated electro-anatomical maps enabling the physician to offer wide-area focal ablation lesions of choice between RF or PFA, based on the patient and procedure needs. The intuitive mapping software enhances user experience by providing efficient insights and feedback to aid procedure performance.CE Mark approval is backed by results from clinical studies assessing the safety and performance of the Sphere-9 Catheter and Mapping System. Last December, the company completed participant enrolment in the FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) randomized, pivotal Affera SPHERE Per-AF clinical trial. The trial was intended to evaluate the Affera Mapping and Ablation System’s effectiveness and safety in treating persistent atrial fibrillation.Benefits of the Ablation CatheterPer management, mapping, ablating and validating with the Sphere-9 Catheter allows the physician to remove the need to exchange catheters and authorizes them to choose the energy source, whether RF or PF, based on the patient's needs. This enhances the efficiency and safety of ablation procedures for our patients.Together, the full system, through the unique integration of the Sphere-9 pulsed field ablation (PFA), radiofrequency (RF) and high density (HD) mapping catheter, generates a new paradigm in electrophysiology, which maps and ablates atrial arrhythmias (fast, abnormal heart rhythms) and offers real-time feedback through its intuitive mapping and navigation software.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was $1,825.85 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $3,370.70 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.4%. The increase in the frequency of atrial fibrillation in the elderly population, technical developments and a preference for catheter ablation for cardiac arrhythmia therapy.Recent DevelopmentsIn February 2023, Medtronic announced one-year data from the ADAPT study -- the first multi-national randomized controlled study evaluating the performance of the MiniMed 780G advanced hybrid closed loop system1 (AHCL) against multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin with an intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM).  The study results were presented at the 2023 Advanced Technologies &amp; Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Conference in Berlin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe same month, Medtronic announced the receipt of the CE mark for the Aurora EV-ICD MRI SureScan (Extravascular Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator) and Epsila EV MRI SureScan defibrillation led to treating abnormal heart rhythms.

Before jumping into today's call, I wanted to share an exciting milestone in Acutus' mission to transform patient care.Just last month, we crossed our 6,000 patients treated with AcQMap globally. We continue to positively impact the lives of patients in ways that no other EP company can and there is no greater reward for us as a company than seeing our technology come to life.With their focus on treating complex cases, we are seeing AcQMap change the course of disease management for a growing number of patients for whom the societal, personal and care burdens are all significant. I am humbled and proud to hear when AcQMap-guided therapy improves patient quality of life and materially reduces the need for another redo procedure. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the extraordinary commitment of my Acutus colleagues as well as the support and engagement from our physician partners for putting our mission into action each and every day. This is also the spirit that will carry us into 2023 and beyond as we return our business to growth through accelerated innovation and ongoing execution.Turning to our recent performance and business updates. We are making good progress on our 2 key strategic imperatives that we presented on our November call, driving utilization and operational excellence. Starting with our first priority to drive utilization and adoption for AcQMap.We continue to execute our commercial strategy with intensified focus on procedure volume growth and utilization over expanding the installed base. While our installed base ended the year down versus 2021, we drove growth in all utilization-related metrics. For the full year 2022, commercial AcQMap procedure volumes increased 19%, console utilization increased 13% and revenue per procedure grew 11% constant currency. Overall, these performance metrics reflect strength in our core business and give us confidence in our ability to deliver growth in 2023 and beyond.Further through achieving our growth objectives is our product pipeline that is geared to both strengthening our position and expanding our addressable opportunity. As we have discussed previously, AcQMap is most regularly used today in redo procedures. Specifically, about 55% of U.S. and 80% of OUS procedures come from redo cases. AcQMap has clear differentiation in these procedures and our clinical results and sustained utilization in these segments underscore the value proposition we offer.At the same time, these procedure categories represent only a portion of the total complex ablation segment. Today, we estimate that our core addressable market is in the $750 million to $1 billion range, which includes all redo AF procedures, transient atrial tachycardias and atypical flutter. By our estimates, this leaves about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of opportunity for AcQMap that we expect to approach incrementally in 2023, expand to cover an additional $1.5 billion in 2024 with the balance coming into view in 2025 and 2026.In aggregate, this brings the addressable market for AcQMap to approximately 475,000 procedures and $3 billion in disposable revenue based on trailing market estimates. Assuming sustained market growth of 10%, our opportunity will likely exceed $4 billion by 2026. The key innovations required to enter new categories largely centered around software, including algorithm development and disposables.Earlier this year, our leadership team undertook a strategic assessment of our R&amp;D road map and decided to redirect resources to prioritize software and catheter development. These are 2 areas where we are growing head count and expect a steady cadence of product launches over the next several years.In 2023 and 2024, we expect to have 2 significant launches in each year for both software and disposables. The sequence of launches starts with our AcQMap 9 software platform which is designed to make significant improvements to catheter localization, procedural efficiency and workflow flexibility. AcQMap 9 will be followed by U.S. introduction of our AcQBlate Force Sensing Ablation Catheter and System. Data we presented at the 2023 AF Symposium as part of the Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session demonstrated strong efficacy with 94% success in the primary efficacy end point was an excellent safety profile of 0 adverse events. Introducing AcQMap 9 and AcQBlate are among the primary drivers for our expectation of improved revenue performance.Moving to 2024. Our revamped road map pulls forward our next major software platform, AcQMap 10 by about 1 year. AcQMap 10 will position us to be a stand-alone system across a broader spectrum of target procedures. Specifically, AcQMap 10 will enable physicians to perform contact and noncontact mapping in a single session. This is a major step forward in aligning our workflow with standard practice and eliminating one of the key barriers to broader adoption of our differentiated mapping solution.Later in 2024, we expect to launch our next-generation AcQBlate 2.0 ablation catheter with bidirectional steering capabilities, improved handling and a lower cost of goods profile. In addition to our new product pipeline, critical to the adoption of AcQMap will be additional clinical research. Over the course of this year, we have plans to release several data presentations and publications that build on the UNCOVER AF study that showed freedom from AF in persistent patients of 72.5% at 1 year.As a reminder, most landmark study data for the treatment of persistent AF with conventional systems show 1-year success rate in the 50% to 60% range. Data we have gathered in additional AcQMap studies show improved outcomes relative to the 72.5% UNCOVER AF benchmark and we look forward to sharing meaningful clinical research throughout the year.Switching gears to our efforts to strengthen our financial performance. We continue to make significant progress during Q4 2022 and recorded our lowest level of operating expenses and cash burn since IPO with year-over-year declines of 35% and 41%, respectively. We expect our cash burn and operating expenses to continue to decline on a year-over-year basis, at least for the first 9 months of 2023. This reflects the ongoing benefits of our restructuring program, disciplined operating expense management and gross margin improvement. Takeo will discuss these dynamics in more detail later in the call.In addition to the internal restructuring to strengthen our financial position, the transition of our left-heart access portfolio to Medtronic is progressing well. We have achieved all earn-out milestones under the agreement and are now eligible to receive 4 years of uncapped revenue-based earn-out starting from February of this year. As a reminder, the earnouts are for 100% of net sales in the first year, 75% of sales in the second year and 50% of sales in the third and fourth years. Putting this altogether, 2022 is a transition year where we reset our strategic priorities, focus our R&amp;D programs and established a strong operating foundation. We expect our business to see progressive improvement in 2023 and even stronger performance in 2024. When combined with our operational improvement initiatives, this business trajectory will position us well for the future and allow us to maximize value for all stakeholders. I'd be happy to cover any of these topics in more detail during our Q&amp;A session, and I will now turn the call over to Takeo.Takeo MukaiThank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. During my remarks today, I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results as well as provide our outlook for 2023. For the fourth quarter, net revenue of $5 million compared to $4.4 million in the year ago fourth quarter as we closed 2022 with our highest level of quarterly sales on record. The 14% year-over-year increase was primarily driven by disposable sales associated with higher AcQMap procedure volumes, growth in left-heart access both organically and through our distribution agreement with Medtronic and modest increases in capital and service and other revenue.For the full year of 2022 net revenue of $16.4 million compared to $17.3 million in the prior year, with declines attributable to a $2.3 million year-over-year reduction in capital equipment sales and $0.4 million in foreign exchange headwinds. Balancing these factors with strong execution on our strategy to drive utilization and procedure volume growth which drove strong underlying growth in disposables, service and other revenue. We ended 2022 with an installed base of 76 systems globally, up sequentially from 74 last quarter and down from 77 in the year ago fourth quarter. We have mostly finished our strategy of moving consoles into higher value accounts throughout 2022. We will continuously evaluate our console utilization to ensure that we are optimizing the installed base, and we expect to grow our installed base globally in 2023.Disposables revenue in the fourth quarter of $3.5 million grew 8% compared to the year ago fourth quarter, driven by 15% growth in global commercial AcQMap procedures and left-heart access products. For the full year, disposables revenue of $12.9 million advanced 8% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11%, excluding negative impact of foreign exchange, supported by 19% growth in commercial AcQMap procedure volumes. We saw stabilization of capital revenue in the fourth quarter with revenue of $0.9 million compared to $0.8 million in the year-ago fourth quarter. For the full year, capital revenue of $1.8 million declined 57% from $4.1 million in 2021, consistent with our expectations and strategic prioritization of procedure volume and same-store utilization growth.Service and other revenue of $0.5 million was up slightly from $0.4 million in Q4 2021. Supply chain disruptions that emerged during the third quarter of 2022 continued through the fourth quarter, and we estimate that these disruptions negatively impacted Q4 2022 and full year 2022 sales by $200,000 and $300,000, respectively.More specifically, we had discussed shortages on our third quarter call related to the AcQGuide MAX 2.0 introducer [sheath]. This product is used on all Acutus' mapping cases as well as other electrophysiology procedures involving large bore sheath. To expedite remediation and ensure long-term supply, we have qualified a secondary vendor for key components and now have sufficient inventory of this particular component for at least the next 18 months. While we resolved AcQGuide MAX shortages in Q1, we did experience disruption with our sole supplier for components in our flagship AcQMap product. This resulted in several weeks of lost production that has created a backorder situation.The AcQMap production shortfall will negatively impact Q1 results, but we now have the requisite supply in-house, and our teams are working 6 days a week to bring production and inventory levels in line with current and expected demand.Non-GAAP gross margin of negative 64% in Q4 2022 improved from negative 110% in the third quarter of 2022 and were favorable compared to the negative 119% registered in the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year and sequential improvement in our non-GAAP gross margins was driven by higher volumes, lower manufacturing variances, the positive impact from our restructuring actions taken earlier in the year and favorable mix, all helping offset increases in raw material costs.We will continue to dedicate significant attention to improving our gross margins and expect to show marked improvement for the full year of 2023. As demonstrated by the fourth quarter, our gross margin will ebb and flow with revenue and overall volumes. This will drive a downtick in Q1 2023, sequentially with improvement through the rest of the year with a path to positive gross margin in the first quarter of 2024.In addition to volumes driving a positive year-over-year trajectory in gross margin, several work streams are underway to drive efficiency in our overhead pool, reduce product costs through improved yield and bringing select processes in-house. Non-GAAP operating expenses were approximately $13.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 35% from the same period last year and is the lowest level of quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses since IPO. On a sequential basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were down 8% as we realized the benefits of our continued discipline around expense management.As a reference point, the annualized fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses of $55.8 million is down 36% compared to 2021. Excluding specified items, our non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $17.9 million or $0.63 per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $28 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 or $1 per share.Our total cash and cash equivalents balance, including restricted cash at the end of 2022, was $76.2 million. Our cash burn, excluding milestone payments and the employee retention credit, was $15.6 million in the fourth quarter, down 41% versus the prior year and down 29% on a sequential basis. We are pleased with the improvements we have made in reducing our quarterly cash burn and we'll continue to drive intense focus on optimizing our financial position.Closing with our outlook for 2023, we expect to see continued execution of our strategy to drive procedure volume, utilization and case revenue share growth. At the same time, we continue to navigate intermittent supply chain disruptions, seasonality and variability in hospital capital expenditure spending which was strong in Q4 of 2022, were relatively weak the rest of last year. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $18 million to $21 million reflecting the continued shift in our trajectory from stabilization to growth. Key drivers underpinning our outlook for 2023 include growth in AcQMap procedure volumes and associated disposable sales globally, selected expansion in our installed base within our direct businesses, further geographic expansion with our partner, Biotronik, and a second half 2023 launch of AcQBlate in the U.S. Accordingly, we expect approximately 45% of full year sales to come in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, relatively consistent with 2022 phasing and normal industry seasonality.In regards to the first quarter of 2023, we expect sales to show modest year-over-year growth compared to the $3.7 million registered in the prior year period. The primary factor weighing on growth in the first quarter of 2023 are the aforementioned AcQMap backorders that will reduce sales by $300,000 to $400,000. These issues are actively being resolved, and we expect to recoup these sales in the balance of the year. As a result, we expect stronger year-over-year growth in the latter 9 months of the year.Overall, we are pleased with our performance exiting 2022. We are executing our strategic imperatives and staying laser focused on the variables we can control in our business. Strong underlying fundamentals set us up to return the business to growth in 2023 with accelerating performance into the outer years.We appreciate your continued interest and support, and I will now turn the call back to the operator to facilitate our Q&amp;A session. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Marie Thibault of BTIG.Marie Yoko ThibaultDavid and Takeo, congrats on the progress in 2022. In particular, the reduced OpEx and cash burn really like to see that. I wanted to ask a first question here on your 2023 guidance and see if we could try to understand what's assumed from the Medtronic left-heart access portfolio sales. I'm not sure how much you can tell us, but would love to understand what you're trying to incorporate into that $18 million to $21 million range.David Harrison RomanYes. Thanks for the question, Marie. And I appreciate the comments. The -- in our distribution agreement with Medtronic, just to make sure everyone is on the same page, we sell to them very similar to the way we do with Biotronik. Medtronic is -- owns our left-heart access portfolio. We continue to manufacture. We sell to them under distribution agreement and then they sell to their end users.In that agreement, as you might imagine, the transfer pricing is considerably lower than where we had been selling the product previously as the primary manufacturer. We can't disclose specifically what sales are expected to be for 2023. But I would say at a high level, the lower distribution price at which we were selling is offset by higher volume. So our expected sales for left-heart access products under the distribution agreement is not too different from what we thought it was going to be under Acutus as the primary manufacturer.Marie Yoko ThibaultOkay. That's helpful. And then maybe I can ask a question here on the AcQGuide MAX shortage update, certainly good to hear that you're resolving and have a qualified vendor and working to remedy that backlog. Wondering if this is going to impact Q2 in your mind, we are almost in Q2, I guess, at this point, and so would love to just sort of get ahead of some of that? Do you think this will all be resolved in Q1 and really from Q2 and Q3, we should be making up some of that difference?David Harrison RomanSure. So on the AcQGuide MAX, that product is required in every AcQMap procedure because it's a large bore incision. We -- in the fourth quarter and the third quarter when we were on backorder and did have shortages, we did have some customers who were willing to go back to the prior version of that product. But I still think we probably lost procedure volumes in the fourth quarter and likely early in the first quarter due to those shortages. It also put our sales team in a position where couldn't necessarily hit the accelerator on new account openings. And we actually restricted the sale of AcQGuide MAX to mapping customers only. And just to put it into perspective, prior to this backorder, we were selling about 2 AcQGuide MAX sheaths for every AcQMap catheter. So we were seeing this product used in other EP procedures. That ratio obviously converged pretty heavily to 1:1 and slightly below that exiting last year and into the early part of this year.So I do think there was a dampening effect little bit to some degree on procedure volumes last year and early this year, mostly associated with our ability to open and support new accounts. We do not expect there to be a direct impact from AcQGuide MAX in the second quarter or through the balance of the year based on where we sit today.The only carryover effect that there may be is earlier this year, as I mentioned, we were restricting the distribution of that product to certain customers. So we might have lost some early in the year momentum around this product, but I don't think that will be felt significantly through the rest of the year.With respect to AcQMap that will have an impact here in the first quarter. Takeo referenced the $300,000 to $400,000 impact in Q1. The encouraging thing to us is that we now have the requisite raw materials in-house to start manufacturing the AcQMaps. We have -- our manufacturing teams are actually working 6 days a week to catch up on necessary supply. The issue is that by the time they're manufactured and sent through sterilization, we won't be able to distribute them and fill existing open purchase orders by the end of the first quarter.We do expect to fill those open purchase orders largely in the second quarter and would expect most of that to be resolved in Q2 and Q3. I would say, again, similar to AcQGuide MAX, the derivative impact here would be as we open new accounts, where we have been doing that with smaller than typical stocking orders to ensure that we are keeping necessary inventory on hand to serve our customers who are on quarterly commitment contracts as well as Biotronik's demand.Marie Yoko ThibaultGot it. And if I could ask a follow-up there. Thanks for clarifying that the map and the MAX for me. Just sort of the long and short of some of these supply issues. Have you detected any reputation damage, have you found that users are hesitant to come back in any way? Just trying to understand whether there could be lingering, I guess, effects on Acutus' reputation from any of this.David Harrison RomanSo we have not. We were very proactive in managing the supply shortages. And as soon as we saw this starting to materialize, I think, it was late September-ish that we started to get the sense that this was going to be an issue. We were very quick in communicating with our customers. We did actively approach accounts who have, what we deem to be, excess inventory on the shelves and actually were buying back inventory from some of our accounts who had inventory levels that were above their normal utilization rates and looking to -- we redistribute those into accounts who had short-term requirements. So we were very proactive and nimble in managing both the inventory that we had in hand as well as working with our customers in a very collaborative way to maximize the inventory they either had on the shelves or do everything in our ability to find inventory for them to be able to perform AcQMap procedures.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Margaret Kaczor of William Blair.Malgorzata Maria Kaczor AndrewI wanted to start with the AcQBlate Force Sensing Catheter. Just how should we think about that launch? Is it going to be, I guess, a limited release, not a full release. How quickly is that going to happen? And as best as you can, whether it's taking guidance or general commentary, I guess, how many of your current accounts or cases do you think are going to want to use that unidirectional device versus why do you just wait for the bidirectional?David Harrison RomanYes, it's a great question, Margaret. So the way I would think about our first launch of AcQBlate is, it falls very much into the category of significantly improving AcQMap's ease of use and physician experience. We have actually made a ton of progress over the past 12 to 18 months in better integrating AcQMap with other ablation catheters, whether that's (inaudible) SmartTouch or Medtronic's DiamondTemp product. So we are -- the integration is significantly better than what it was; however, what you'll often hear from a lot of accounts is we are really interested in using AcQMap more, but we want to be able to use it on a ""standalone basis"", meaning with an integrated ablation catheter and -- ablation catheters are very much physician preference products. But the way we will position this product and position the launch is very much around improving the overall ease of use of AcQMap and being able to facilitate more efficient procedures with both new and prospective customers -- excuse me, new as well as existing customers, especially in response to that comment that we do get from some potential users around the need to be able to use this on a more integrated basis.Because this is a product that's already on the market in Europe, we do have a good sense of the sort of segmentation utilization. As you know, not 100% of our procedures in Europe are using AcQBlate is probably hovering now in the 50% to 60% range, and it's been very stable at that level. It was a little bit higher at launch when we had a smaller installed base in the region. But we do see pretty stable use at that level.In terms of the launch, we would be -- typically, when we launch a new product, we would be in some sort of LMR, limited market release, for an extended period of time. The reality is that because this is not a totally new-to-market product for us because if we market it commercially outside the United States, we would probably have a somewhat accelerated LMR process with targeted accounts likely isolated around many of our existing users, but look to move pretty quickly from limited market release to full market release subsequent to when we get this on the market.Malgorzata Maria Kaczor AndrewOkay. So maybe I'll repeat it back to you just to make sure that we're aligned on it. But it sounds like you're saying 3 benefits. So, one, you can get more system sales, replacements and contracts. Two, get the ASP increase obviously from getting more pocket share. And then, three, you see greater utilization, I guess, for certain cases that you can't really get into today for ease of use issues. So, one, is that correct? And then, two, is that assumed much in guidance, if at all?David Harrison RomanYes. So I think that's a very good summary. With respect to what's in the guidance, I would say if all 3 of those things materialized extraordinarily -- well that would put us at or above the high end of the range that we're communicating here. Given that we are still awaiting approval and need to go through that committee, et cetera, we are taking a measured view on the contribution to AcQBlate in the guidance we're offering here today.Sorry, Margaret, one last clarification. On the unidirectional versus bidirectional, when you steer with a sheath -- most physicians -- which is a very common practice, there won't be a materially noticeable difference.Malgorzata Maria Kaczor AndrewOkay. That's helpful. Yes. And then just kind of a big picture question, I guess. And you spent a lot of the front end talking about this as a change to the R&amp;D road map. So, one, I guess, where did you take the spend away from? And I assume it systems, but then more importantly, as you think about the software component, where do you see the biggest gap or capability that you guys can not only catch up on, but maybe take a lead against your competition?David Harrison RomanYes. So I'll start with the second part of your question and come back to the allocation question in a second. With respect to the software impact that we can have, remember, we are the only company that offers ultrasound-based noncontact mapping. We're also the only company that really can offer the mapping of AFIB as well as other complex rhythms outside of the pulmonary veins. What we lack today, however, is the ability to do basic contact mapping within the same -- within what we describe as the same session. So basically, we offer contact mapping, but to go from contact mapping to noncontact mapping, you have to shut down one mapping session and open another one. And that can add about 15 minutes to a case, which given the procedure time here, 15 minutes is a pretty significant percentage addition.When we launch AcQMap 10 in the first half of next year, that will enable physicians to do contact and noncontact mapping in the same session. And that will allow us to really be rolled into a lab and have an Acutus day in the lab. And this is where we see some of our most productive accounts utilize us right now, and it's not the overall majority is one day of the week is an Acutus day. Right now, that's a tough ask for us until we can really offer competitive contact mapping. And if we can pair contact mapping and [contact] (sic) [noncontact] mapping into one session, which is the design of AcQMap 10, that goes a long way to knocking down probably one of the biggest barriers to the use of AcQMap because in a lot of cases today, physicians will do a contact map on Abbott or Biosense and then they will bring an Acutus to do a noncontact map to evaluate regions outside the pulmonary veins. That adds time and cost to the cases, and it's one of the biggest reasons why we see Acutus most regularly used in redo cases.Being able to move up the curve into de novo persistence is a huge driver of incremental growth that we expect in 2024, and that's largely tied to software and algorithm development that will make the system able to really work on a stand-alone basis, especially when you combine that with an ablation catheter.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of William Plovanic of Canaccord.William John PlovanicSo a couple of things. One, unfortunate on the supply challenges, sorry to hear about that. What is -- if you -- obviously, I'm sure you've done an extensive review, any other raw material issues that you've identified other products? What's your ability to prepare for the launch of the AcQBlate? Does that impact it in any way? How should we kind of think about any of those potential things going forward? That's my first question.Takeo MukaiThanks for the question, Bill. At this moment -- at this point, we do not see any other risk to raw material supply challenges as it relates to the AcQBlate launch or any of our other products. And as we've recovered on the AcQGuide 2.0 sheath product line and we navigate through the supply challenges, which we have a line of path to recovering here in the second quarter here. We don't see any risk related to supply challenges.William John PlovanicOkay. And then how do you plan on accounting for the Medtronic, and I know this may be nuanced, but is it the transfer price is up top and then the royalty is down below? Or does it all hit revenues? Or is one thing above line, one below the line? How is that -- have you worked through the accounting for that yet?David Harrison RomanWe have. So the sales under the distribution agreement calculated at the transfer price will show up as revenue. The accrual for the earn-out associated with the revenue-based milestone payments will be reported in the other line as gain on asset sale. The same way that the earn-outs under the -- excuse me, the milestones for OEM qualification EU MDR filing were reported in 2022.William John PlovanicOkay. So they'll be below the operating line thing. And then just a clarification question on OpEx. I think the comment was OpEx will be down every quarter year-over-year through the first half or first 9 months. Will it also be down sequentially? Or is it kind of flatlining from the fourth quarter?Takeo MukaiSo I can take that as well. It will be relatively flat. We've reached the exit point as we noted on the fourth quarter exiting at $14 million. So from that point, I think, that's the only reason why we say the first 9 months. We stabilize the OpEx, but we are adding -- as we manage our expenses, we are adding head count selectively, especially to support some of the software improvements and our engineering efforts. And so we have a modest increase in our operating expenses.And the reason why we have the year-over-year decline for the first 9 months, as you recall, in the -- we had the restructuring that was announced in the first quarter and most of the reductions in the savings materialize in the second and third quarters. And for that reason, I would expect operating expenses to be relatively flat for the remainder of 2023 with a modest uptick from Q4 as we exited 2022. Hopefully, that answers the question.William John PlovanicYes. And going back to the earlier question on Medtronic, given the fact you're now going to transfer pricing, which is a much lower gross margin, I think your commentary was that the gross margins are definitely -- they'll get hit in the front end of the year, but as the Medtronic revenues ramp through the year, then we kind of get back on pace. Is that a fair way to think about it?Takeo MukaiYes. So on the gross margin, that's correct. And really, the biggest driver for our gross margin improvements in 2023 will come from volumes, which the production ramp of our left-heart access products will contribute to. And so as we continue to reduce our overhead costs, and we are seeing the effects and improvements from that, we do have high fixed costs to operate our -- manufacture our products. And so volume plays an important part in driving leverage, and that will be a key driver for 2023. And maybe perhaps on 2 other contributors or drivers for the gross margin improvements, while we continue our cost reduction efforts across every single product line that we sell, which is looking at improving our labor costs for the production, improving efficiencies and the yields. And so that will be another primary factor.And finally, as we continue to increase our revenue contribution from the U.S., the U.S. has the highest gross margin. And so as we launch our products and as the contribution from the U.S. increase, that mix will add to the improvements in gross margins.William John PlovanicOkay. And then my last question is, you've really done a phenomenal job of kind of rightsizing the ship and getting it going again. And doing that in a very nondilutive way thus far. And you've got about [5 quarters] of cash, you're burning -- assuming the $15 million burn, these are my numbers, not yours. But with the cash you have and the $15 million burn, that will be [5, 6 quarters]. Kind of how do you think about funding the company as you get forward because as you're exiting the year and into next year, even with the positive gross margin, you still need capital to execute. And so how are you thinking about that? And I don't know if you're ready to address that at this point in time, but I thought I'd -- to me, that's the elephant in the room that we're looking at.David Harrison RomanYes. It's a great question, Bill, and I may leave you a little unsatisfied in my response at this point in time. But let me give you a few thoughts that will help kind of contextualize how we're approaching this. Firstly is -- our #1 priority is to make the cash we have last as long as possible while not starving the business. We see ample opportunities if needed to evaluate our spend rates and cash burn, and we will make necessary adjustments. And if we do need to respond to any unforeseen challenges in market dynamics.Second, we will receive the first earn-out from the distribution agreement with Medtronic, obviously, in the first half of next year, the measurement period is February to January, then we would expect to receive that royalty payment shortly after that. That -- obviously, that number is highly variable and depends on, obviously, the end user adoption of the AcQCross product line and Medtronic's commercialization, which is thus far going very well. So we will look for any opportunity to maximize that earn-out to provide us further cushion with respect to our cash balance. Third is, as you know, we have a very strong partnership with Medtronic and Biotronik. And as those companies continue to drive growth with our portfolio in key markets that represents a source of both revenue and cash flow upside for us that may extend the cash beyond what you are modeling? And then we will look to selectively consider different capital vehicles as we go through this year.Right now, our top priority is on driving the business. And as we think about what the company will look like in early 2024, when we start to get closer to a point in time when a capital raise may be required, we believe we'll have a very different profile than what you see today a level of revenue scale and positive gross margin that becomes a much more attractive asset than what the company may look like on a trailing basis and will put us in as strong position as possible to ensure we have the capital needed to run the business long term.OperatorThank you. That does conclude Acutus' Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.]"

Their opposition centred on fears a vaccine could mask the spread of bird flu but tests indicate it would not be the case with the two vaccines tested in the Netherlands.As part of a European programme, the Netherlands has been testing bird flu vaccines for egg-laying hens while France is carrying out tests on ducks, Italy on turkeys and Hungary on Pekin ducks.Most of these tests are based on existing vaccines and adapted to the particular H5N1 strain that has been spreading in Europe.The Wageningen Bioveterinary Research, located northeast of Amsterdam, had carried out tests on four chicken vaccines before selecting those of Ceva Animal Health and Boehringer Ingelheim. The other two vaccines that were tested were produced by Bulgaria's Huvepharma and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) respectively, the official document showed.Story continues""I'm happy that we have two vaccines with which we can take the vaccination process against bird flu forward. I'm putting in the next steps as quickly as possible but in a responsible way (...),"" Dutch Minister of Agriculture Piet Adema said in the statement.A field trial will be launched to see whether the vaccines that work in a laboratory setting are also effective if applied in wider conditions.The trial should take more than a year to give an idea of how long chickens are still immune after vaccination, Adema said in a letter to the President of the House of Representatives dated Friday, also available on the government website.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. From the palm of your hand, to your refrigerator, and your car, technology is everywhere. Alongside disrupting consumers' lives, tech has also transformed industries and shaken up the way in which firms manage their plants and warehouses. Robots and drones are everywhere, from the hospital bed to the factory floor and the skies of a warzone, and powering all this innovation is the automation sector.Before we get to the nitty gritty of the industry, it is important to take stock of what automation really means. According to Electrical Technology, industrial automation is a step beyond simple mechanization. While mechanization involves operators running machines on the factory floor, automation replaces them with logic boards that come preprogrammed with commands instead. However automation is not limited to industrial applications, and neither is it a new concept. You'd be surprised to learn that one of the first applications of automation came in 1892 in the form of the telephone switchboard, which automated the process of connecting phone calls between users.Since then, the industry has rapidly evolved. As of 2022 the global industrial application market was worth $206 billion according to research from Fortune Business Insights. From 2022 until 2039, the research firm expects that the sector will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% to sit at an estimated $395 billion at the end of the forecast period. Fortune Business Insights believes that the pairing of digital technology into commercial operations and a growing interlinkage of firms within the sector will drive this growth. It adds that Europe was the dominating player in the industrial automation industry in 2021, as it accounted for $61.8 billion of the $192 billion market, but adds that Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region due to rapid industrialization.Story continuesWhile so far we have talked about industrial automation, one area that you might not know that is being affected by this change is the finance industry. Investment bank UBS, which deals with countless client orders for stock trading, is using artificial intelligence to sort through these requests. According to Deloitte, this has reduced the time that it takes for UBS to sort these allocation requests by a stunning 96%, as it has dropped from an earlier 45 minutes to now just two minutes. Deloitte further expects that up to 861,000 public sector jobs within the U.K. will be replaced by automation by 2030, allowing a £15 billion cost reduction compared to 2015. This will be done through a subsegment of the automation market called Robotic Process Automation (RPA). This segment is purely software based, with the software robots aiding firms in decision making and taking the workload off of human employees.Finally, alongside software robots, hardware robots have also made their mark. One of the strongest examples of this is Boston Dynamics, whose robot dog, Spot, is already aiding a variety of sectors with their daily operations. These range from SpaceX using the robot to manage chemicals around its launch pad, to the British Royal Air Force using it to navigate through rough terrain during patrols.Best Automation Stocks To Buy NowImage by Computerizer from PixabayAnother robot that has made waves is the one made by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). This is used to aid surgeons during their surgeries. Surgeries are among the most complex operations performed by humans, and during a recent earnings call, Intuit's head of investor relations Mr. Brian King commented on the current state of the industry as he outlined:Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a three-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the US and 22% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The US procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, US procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the US, fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year, compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in UK, Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the UK, we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy. Turning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid, with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter. Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery, with strong early stage growth in colon resection and hysterectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures.Today, we'll look at some of the best automation stocks that are on hedge funds' watchlist, with their top picks being NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Seagen’s Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales Estimates Beat, Stock UpSeagen Inc. reported a loss of 80 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.02. The company reported a loss of 95 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $528 million, increasing 22.93% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $483 million. Net product revenues in the year-ago quarter were $430 million, up 22.79% year over year, driven by the strong uptake of Seagen’s portfolio of marketed cancer drugs.Shares of Seagen rallied 6.33% in the after-market hours in response to the better-than-expected financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2022.Quarter in DetailSeagen’s top line mainly comprises product revenues, collaboration and license agreement revenues and royalties. The company currently markets four drugs, Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and the newly approved Tivdak.Adcetris generated net sales of $238 million in the United States and Canada, up 35% year over year. The drug, which is the major contributor to SGEN’s revenues, is being evaluated in several label expansion studies.Padcev sales in the reported quarter totaled $122 million. Sales of the drug rose 32% on a year-over-year basis.Tukysa’s fourth-quarter net sales were $86 million, down  9% on a year-over-year basis.The newly launched Tivdak generated sales worth $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a sequential increase of 12.5%.Story continuesCollaboration and license agreement revenues were $11 million in the fourth quarter, marking a decrease from the year-ago quarter. However, collaboration and license agreement revenues for the full year of 2022 increased, compared with the same period in 2021. The uptick was primarily driven by an upfront license fee of $30 million received from Zai Lab Limited (ZLAB).In September 2022, Seagen entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of Tivdak in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.ZLAB obtained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Tivdak in the given territory.Royalty revenues of $53 million rose by 15.28% from the year-ago quarter’s $46 million. Seagen records royalty revenues on the sales of Adcetris from Takeda Pharmaceutical in the ex-U.S. markets, as well as from Polivy’s sales under its collaboration with Roche (RHHBY).Polivy is an antibody-drug conjugate that uses Seagen’s technology and is commercialized by Roche.Research and development expenses of $358 million increased 17.76% year over year, primarily driven by continued investment in the development of approved drugs and pipeline programs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.37% year over year to $216 million, mainly on account of higher costs related to the recent commercialization activities as well as costs incurred on other corporate activities.Cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $1.74 billion for Seagen at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.Full-Year 2022 Revenues in the full-year 2022 were clocked at $1.96 billion, portraying a 24.65% increase compared with 2021 results. Sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92 billion as well as the guided range of $1.82-$1.86 billion.Loss per share for the full year was $3.30 which is narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $3.54.2023 GuidanceSeagen has provided its financial guidance for 2023. Total revenues are now expected in the range of $2.14-$2.24 billion.Total net product revenues are expected in the range of $1.93-$2.00 billion rolling into 2023.The company expects collaboration and license revenues in the band of $45-$55 million while royalty revenues are anticipated within the $170-$185 million range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted 6.21% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Seattle Genetics has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Seattle Genetics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSeattle Genetics belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.

AVB, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. MAA and Elme Communities ELME.Industry: Residential REITLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2066779/3-residential-reits-to-consider-despite-industry-challengesThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential Industry constituents are expected to bear the brunt of macroeconomic uncertainties in the near term. Elevated deliveries, the lack of rental relief payments and regulatory issues are expected to add to the woes. High real estate taxes and insurance costs are likely to add to cost pressures. A hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes.Nevertheless, residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc., Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and Elme Communities are poised to benefit. Renting apartment units is a viable option as mortgage rates are high and the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult with the high costs of homeownership. Also, residential REITs are banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of their operating platforms.About the IndustryThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential category is engaged in owning, developing and managing a variety of residences. The types of residences include apartment buildings, student housing, manufactured homes and single-family homes. Residential REITs rent spaces in these properties to tenants and earn rental income in return. Markedly, some residential REITs focus on specific classes or types of residences, or a particular geographical region.Moreover, unlike apartment buildings, manufactured homes and single-family homes that are open for leasing to all, the student housing units are leased only to students. Such real estates are, therefore, generally required to be set up within or in places closer to colleges and universities. Furthermore, the enrollment growth of educational institutes is a major driver of student housing assets.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry's Future?Macroeconomic Uncertainties: The residential REIT industry constituents face headwinds from a softening of the economy in the current year. A slowing economy is likely to cast a pall on leasing activity, and affect rental rate growth and occupancy level. The impacts of the slowdown are likely to be more profound in case of a slowing economy during the peak leasing season than later in the year.Elevated Deliveries of New Units: While supply-chain issues and labor challenges have impacted construction activity to some extent in the past quarters, deliveries of new units are likely to accelerate in a number of markets in the upcoming quarters, as the ongoing construction activity remains high, resulting in a struggle on the part of landlords to lure renters. The elevated new supply is likely to weigh on rental rates and the occupancy level of residential REITs' properties.Lack of Rental Relief Payments and Cost Pressure: Growth in revenues of residential REITs is likely to be affected by bad debt, given the lack of rental relief payments in 2023. Moreover, amid an inflationary environment, residential REITs are facing higher cost pressure, with utilities, payroll, and repair and maintenance costs remaining elevated. Adding to the woes are property taxes and insurance, which are not only high but also volatile. Given the frequency and severity of several disasters over the past couple of years, there is greater pressure on insurance rates. Also, for real estate taxes, municipal fiscal pressures are driving the growth rate.Complicated Regulatory Environment: With growing focus by state and local, and in certain cases federal and governmental authorities, the regulatory environment for rental housing continues to be complex. Particularly, the rent-control regulations in some of the major markets might curb the growth tempo. In recent years, there has been an increase in states and municipalities implementing or considering rent-control or rent-stabilization laws and regulations. This is limiting the residential REITs' power to raise rents or charge non-rent fees.Higher Interest Rates: The hike in interest rates to counter inflation poses a risk to the flow of capital for this asset category. This is likely to lead to volatility in asset prices. Also, interest expenses are expected to climb with rate hikes. However, mortgage rates are high, and with the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult, making renting apartment units a viable option.Technology Adoption: Technological adoption gathered steam amid the social-distancing trend. Residential REITs are combining technology with sales and service expertise, aiming at driving revenues, trimming costs, improving operating margins, and enhancing customer experience. The REITs are focusing on virtual leasing assistance, virtual and self-guided tours, digital move-in processes, and process enhancements. Improvements in search and tour bookings, as well as smart home access, have gained much attention, and residential REITs are focusing on the same. Such efforts aim to generate incremental net operating income in the years ahead.Rebound in Demand for Student Housing Properties: There has been a significant rebound in demand for student housing properties on the reopening of campuses and in-person classes, as well as extracurricular activities, driving leasing activity and rent growth. Rent growth hit another high in the Fall 2023 pre-leasing season, per a RealPage report.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry is housed within the broader Finance sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #161, which places it at the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the downward funds from operations (FFO) per share outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's growth potential. Over the past year, the industry's FFO per share estimates for 2023 and 2024 have moved down 6.1% and 1.5%, respectively.However, before we present a few stocks that you might want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags on Stock Market PerformanceThe Zacks REIT And Equity Trust - Residential industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 28.5% during this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 12.6% and the broader Finance sector's dip of 15.4%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio, which is a commonly-used multiple for valuing Residential REITs, we see that the industry is currently trading at 15.94X compared with the S&amp;P 500's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 15.99X. The industry is trading above the Finance sector's forward 12-month P/E of 12.88X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.48X and as low as 15.15X, with a median of 18.96X.3 Residential REIT Stocks Trying to Survive Industry ChallengesElme Communities is a multi-family real estate investment trust that owns and operates apartment homes principally in the Washington, DC, metro and the Sunbelt regions.The REIT's portfolio allocation to the Washington metro offers insulation from employment loss. Also, its mid-level rents offer protection from new supply woes.Elme Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year FFO per share of 99 cents suggests a 12.5% year-over-year increase, backed by 11.4% growth in revenues. The company's shares have gained 0.8% in the past three months.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.AvalonBay Communities primarily focuses on developing, redeveloping, acquiring and managing apartment communities in the leading metropolitan areas in New England, the New York/New Jersey Metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California, as well as in its expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, NC; Southeast Florida; Dallas and Austin, TX; and Denver, CO.AvalonBay Communities is poised to benefit from high-quality assets in the premium markets, and portfolio diversification among the urban and suburban markets. In its first-quarter 2023 operating update, AvalonBay Communities reported a 10.5% increase in same-store residential rental revenues for the two months ended Feb 28, 2023, compared with the prior-year period. This is in sync with the company's initial expectation, which was published on Feb 8, 2023.AVB reported that the economic occupancy for its same-store residential communities improved to 96.2% in February from 95.8% in January 2023. The like-term effective rent change for same-store residential communities improved to 4.2% in February from 3.7% in January.AvalonBay Communities currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its ongoing-year FFO per share has been revised marginally upward in the past week. The company's shares have appreciated 4.8% in the past three months.Mid-America Apartment Communities is headquartered in Germantown, TN, and is commonly known as MAA. This residential REIT is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.Mid-America Apartment Communities' well-diversified Sunbelt-focused portfolio is set to gain from healthy operating fundamentals and a strong development pipeline. The favorable in-migration trends of jobs and households in SunBelt submarkets are likely to fuel demand. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues, going forward. The prospects of its redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to expand margins. Its solid balance sheet acts as a tailwind.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The recent trend in estimate revision indicates a favorable outlook for MAA. Particularly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has been revised marginally upward over the past month to $9.17. The company's shares have declined 2.9% in the past three months.Note: Funds from operations (FFO) is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations. FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

144,c02bace5-3cff-399a-979c-6052231deeca,CI,2023-03-18,"5 HMO Stocks to Watch Despite Elevated Tech Costs, Nursing Shortage",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hmo-stocks-watch-despite-151903771.html,1679066343,STORY,"['UNH', 'CI', 'MOH', 'CNC', 'HUM', '^GSPC']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to benefit from a solid Government business that fetches higher premiums to industry players. Contract wins, a growing customer base and a solid merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy are added tailwinds for the space. Though technology investments are pursued to expand digital capabilities, they might often elevate costs for industry participants. Shortage of nurses is another headwind. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH are better placed to counter the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Defining the HMO Industry FutureContinuous Technology Advancements: Owing to the ongoing digitization across every sphere of life, individuals often prefer healthcare services from the comfort of their homes. The demand for digital healthcare services is expected to remain high in the days ahead. As a result, players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay up-to-date with the digital trend. Digital investments for health insurers are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms and boosting operational efficiencies. This, in turn, expands digital capabilities and diversifies revenue streams of the players. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Story continuesScarcity of Nurses: The U.S. healthcare industry has been grappling with an acute shortage of nurses and other medical personnel for quite some. As more U.S. people continue to reach retirement age, the nursing shortage will likely persist. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to arrange for discounted care access for plan members. This feature remains lucrative for individuals to opt for a particular health insurer’s plan. Thereby, an insufficient nursing workforce can dampen a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services to the plan members. This, in turn, can indirectly impact the customer base of health insurers. It can be problematic as the premiums of the HMO players depend, to a large extent, on healthy membership growth. According to a McKinsey report, the United States will likely see a dearth of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025. This further points toward the challenging days that await health insurers.Growing Premiums: A well-performing Government business provides an impetus to the most vital component of a health insurer’s top line —  premiums. Through this business, the insurers devise affordable health plans and extend them across several U.S. communities. These plans, integrated with some eye-catchy features, fetch federal or state contracts to the HMO players from time to time. These contract wins boost their customer base. An aging U.S. population sounds well for health insurers as it can sustain the demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above) offered through Government business. But the continued impact of inflation can take a toll on the spending habits of consumers and infuse some uncertainty in their uninterrupted healthcare premium payments.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the HMO space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities and solidify their nationwide presence. Industry players place a keen eye on M&amp;A strategy to increase customer base, introduce new products and services, enter new markets and delve deeper into existing ones. The primary aim behind these deals is to bring diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. An exciting year awaits, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects.

It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #219, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The Nasdaq Bank Index is down more than 20% from its Feb. high due to its exposure to the now-delisted SIVB stock. Meanwhile, startups and growth names are also starting to feel the pressure, as nearly half of all U.S. tech startups have exposure to this bank. The bottom line is that tough times are ahead for the stock market. Even if the financial institutions deal with the ripple effects, a terminal rate above 5% will definitely have some negative implications. However, there are still some top stocks to buy in the chaos.And as long as you have cash on hand, it is best to take a contrarian approach and start capitalizing on the discounts. You may have to absorb some short-term losses, but by panning through a historical stock market chart, it is easy to realize that tough times are golden opportunities. By buying some of the top stocks to buy, investors can position themselves for massive returns when the market roars back. In fact, some of the top stocks to buy include:RUNSunrun$21.26FVRRFiverr$34.47CRWDCrowdStrike$121.41VZVerizon$36.54SWKSSkyworks Solutions$111.27LMTLockheed Martin$477.33NOCNorthrop Grumman$457.74Stocks to Buy: Sunrun (RUN)The Sunrun (RUN) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of an American flag.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comSunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) lost over 18% of its value in the past five days. The catalyst at play here is its exposure to Silicon Valley Bank, which investors worry could cause issues for the company. However, Reuters reports, “Sunrun has cash deposits with SVB totaling nearly $80 million, while SVB’s undrawn commitment in the non-recourse senior aggregation warehouse facility is about $40 million.” That’s a lot of money, but Sunrun had $740.5 million in cash at the end of 2022.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOn the other hand, SVB closing down does hurt Sunrun’s funding, but the impact here is limited. There are many banks that’ll gladly take SVB’s spot as the risk with Sunrun’s business model is relatively low, and they get to improve their ESG scores as a bonus.Story continuesTherefore, the selloff looks overdone. The business has excellent growth prospects and deserves a much higher premium over the coming years. Environmental problems are also among the government’s top priorities, and it’s unlikely that Sunrun won’t receive support if it ever gets in trouble. Regardless, the Fed’s bailout means a very strong rebound due for RUN stock after the SVB catalyst is priced in.Stocks to Buy: Fiverr (FVRR)Newspapers: everyday searching for job and business opportunities. February Jobs ReportSource: Mykola Komarovskyy / Shutterstock.comFiverr (NYSE:FVRR) is a global online marketplace that connects entrepreneurs and freelancers to provide a variety of services, from graphic design to coding and marketing, at prices as low as $5. The company’s business model is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanding freelance market, with more companies adopting the gig economy as a cost-effective alternative to hiring full-time workers.Fiverr’s user-friendly platform has resulted in remarkable customer retention, with spending per buyer growing by 8% year-over-year. While the company is not yet profitable due to its significant marketing expenditures, it has a loyal customer base and a management team focused on growth while keeping losses tolerable. As the company captures more market share in the burgeoning gig industry, its top line is expected to continue to grow at a healthy clip, making it one of the hottest stocks in the coming years.However, in its Q4 press release, the company stated, “For revenue, we expect Q1’23 to be the most challenging quarter in terms of year-over-year growth rate, due to the comparison to Q1’22 when growth was minimally impacted by macro headwinds. We expect year-over-year revenue growth rates to increase over the course of 2023 and we expect to exit 2023 with double-digit revenue growth rate at the midpoint.”Regardless of the near-term outlook, the company’s remarkable customer retention and continual reinvestment in itself suggest significant potential for long-term growth. With its cash reserves growing annually, FVRR is a multi-bagger investment that could generate substantial profits in the coming years.Stocks to Buy: CrowdStrike (CRWD)internet security and data protection concept, blockchain and cybersecuritySource: Song_about_summer / ShutterstockCrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a cybersecurity company that is starting to pick up some momentum after reaching low valuations. It beat its Q4 earnings-per-share estimates by 10.4% and grew its top line by 47.9% YoY. Net profit margin also rose by 23.5% but remains in negative territory. These trends are positively affecting the outlook of the company. Especially considering cybersecurity is expected to be a $376.3 billion market by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 13.4%. And so far, the company is rapidly capturing this addressable market. CrowdStrike’s 3-Year Revenue growth rate is among the strongest in the industry at 43.5%. That’s better than 91.75% of its peers. Its EBITDA growth of 39.3% is also better than 83.2% of the competition.By the end of this year, the company expects “total revenue to be in the range of $674.9 million to $678.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 38% to 39%.” That sort of growth deserves a much higher premium.Verizon (VZ)Verizon store sign. VZ stock.Source: ShutterstockVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a business you shouldn’t ignore at its current valuation. The company is set to rebound due to the government’s focus on expanding telecommunications infrastructure, especially 5G. While Verizon’s 5G network is less extensive than its competitors, the company is covering significant ground and outpacing its competitors. Verizon seeks to cover at least 250 million people within the next two years and will likely have the broadest coverage in a few years. Back to valuations, VZ stock is changing hands at just 7.8 times forward earnings, yielding 7.1%. That’s a massive bargain, even if you consider the expectation of EBITDA shrinking to $47.5 billion this year as total wireless service revenue still grows at a healthy clip. In a few years, I believe this company will benefit from much more than just 5G.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS)semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is a semiconductor company, one which Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can’t get enough of. The company supplies Apple with many high-tech parts chips, and most of its sales are related to Apple. Of course, that does mean that any ripples in Apple will cause problems for SWKS, but its current discounted valuation isn’t something investors should ignore.For one, Apple has among the deepest pockets and very high product demand. The company had much less cost-cutting than its competitors, and inflation has little impact on its customer base. Thus, SWKS shouldn’t be as under-appreciated for its association with Apple while it boasts a net margin better than 81% of its competitors. As Gurufocus.com notes, it is significantly undervalued with a lot more room to run.Lockheed Martin (LMT)An F-16 and an F-35 model at the background, at the Lockheed Martin exhibition stand in Thessaloniki International Fair.Source: Giannis Papanikos / Shutterstock.comLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is well-positioned to be the largest beneficiary of surging military budgets worldwide. The company already had a backlog of $150 billion by the end of last quarter, up 11%. That indicates that demand is indeed accelerating, and investors will likely put a more premium price tag on the stock as the geopolitical scene keeps heating up.There is also a massive share repurchase program, with Lockheed Martin returning $5 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in Q4. That’s almost half of the $10.9 billion returned in all of 2022. Going forward, I believe even more will be returned as the company still had $6.1 billion left in operating cash last year.Moreover, as NATO increases its defense budget and countries like Japan, Australia, and Taiwan boost their budgets, Lockheed Martin is set to be among the largest beneficiaries of this trend. Lockheed Martin’s role in the aerospace industry is also worth noting, particularly its significant business in satellite manufacturing. With all that in mind, LMT is among the top stocks with good potential.Northrop Grumman (NOC)United States Air Force Northrop Grumman (NOC) RQ-4B Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft.Source: viper-zero / Shutterstock.comMuch like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) is another defense contractor with a swollen backlog. The company had a backlog of $78.7 billion last year, with orders for “defense systems” surging by 18%. This year, it expects to grow sales to $38.2 billion from $36.6 billion.Perhaps the moderating growth is why Gurufocus.com believes the stock is “modestly overvalued.” But investors should still consider that NOC has a PE ratio ranked better than 81.98% of its peers. Politicians from both sides of the aisle are also more supportive of increasing defense budgets after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Defense products are an inelastic source of revenue for these companies, and NOC is among the stocks with good potential that will weather harsh economic conditions, despite lower near-term growth.That said, I expect much higher growth in the long term. The company expects “…a greater than 20% compound annual growth in our multiyear cash flow outlook that supports continued investments in the business and significant returns of capital to shareholders.”On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Let's take a look at where those stocks closed this week, starting with First Republic ending the week down 72% for the week. Today it was down 33%. Let's also take a look at Credit Suisse, ending the week down 24%, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And let's take a look at some of those other regionals here taking a massive hit. First Republic falling more than 70% over the last five days. Now it's the biggest weekly drop on record here for that company. You're seeing really losses across the board, with Western Alliance, PacWest Bancorp, also Zions closing the week in the red.And it wasn't just those regional plays. Big banks, they also declined. The XL [? left ?] down almost 6% for the week. And for the day, you're looking at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citi, Wells Fargo all closing in the red.For a full breakdown of what has been a very eventful week for the banking sector, we want to get over to our very own Rachelle Akuffo.[MUSIC PLAYING]RACHELLE AKUFFO: So we're taking a look down memory lane on all the key moments leading up to the current frazzled state of the banking sector in this week's installment of ""What Just Happened?""Now it begins with Silicon Valley Bank, when it proposed selling stock to raise additional capital, leading to clients pulling their money from the bank out of fear, as depositors tried to withdraw $42 billion from the institution. Then Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen addressed the Silicon Valley turmoil on March 10 over concerns of SVB.JANET YELLEN: There are recent developments that concern a few banks that I'm monitoring very carefully. And when banks experience financial losses, it is and should be a matter of concern.RACHELLE AKUFFO: However, Yellen making note when convening with financial regulators that the banking system remains resilient. Now the same day, Silicon Valley was seized by regulators, along with Signature Bank over the same weekend, in which regulators said a systemic risk exception, which allows the government to pay back uninsured depositors.Story continuesAt the start of the week SVB depositors were given access to their money, followed by investigations opening the next day on SVB's collapse. And in the midst of the fallout of SVB in the US, overseas fears began bubbling over Credit Suisse. Now the worries of the Swiss bank's viability sent both regional and big bank stocks tumbling once again, with shares of First Republic taking the worst beating, dropping 60% on March 13. Though Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen once again reassuring the safety of the banking system in yesterday's remarks.JANET YELLEN: I can reassure the members of the committee that our banking system is sound and that Americans can feel confident that their deposits will be there when they need them. This week's actions demonstrate our resolute commitment to ensure that our financial system remains strong and that depositors' savings remain safe.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It wasn't long before First Republic was given a lifeline, receiving $30 billion in deposits from other banks, while Credit Suisse is set to receive a $54 billion loan from the Swiss central bank. However, the fallout of Silicon Valley Bank continues, as its parent company files for chapter 11 bankruptcy.]"

Selling off once again today, you're looking at losses of 33% today alone. There's still a lot of worry out there clearly about the possible contagion risk. Well, First Republic has lost more than 2/3 of its value this week.On Thursday, 11 US banks, including JPMorgan, Citi, Bank of America all deposited $30 billion into First Republic, the effort here to restore confidence in First Republic coming after the collapse of Signature Bank on Sunday, Silicon Valley Bank last Friday. Now Silicon Valley bank's parent company SVB Financial Group, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy today. Bank stocks ending the week lower and then the day lower. You can see that on your screen with most of the larger banks off just over 3% today.But we got to talk about regionals because that's really where the story is. Heavy selling across the board. We have PacWest off nearly 19% today. Zions Bancorp off another 6%, almost 7%, a 15% drop in Western Alliance. And, Ines, when you talk about the fact that, yes, this move, this rescue plan, this rescue package from 11 of the largest banks, it was meant to help shore up some of the concern out there on the street, some of the worry about the contagion risk.But still when you take a look at their action today, also the fact that the company suspended its dividend, the outlook looks pretty dire. And we heard that from KBW banking analyst, Chris McGroarty, earlier in the show. He was saying that this rescue deal for First Republic, it was just a temporary lifeline and there certainly a lot of weakness within that company. A lot of weakness were broadly speaking and some other names within the space and certainly something to keep an eye on here.INES FERRE: Yeah, because we don't know the exact details of that lifeline that was given by the banks to First Republic, and so what will that do to the bottom line for First Republic. And you're seeing that reflected with the stock today. You are seeing also over the last five days-- I'm pulling up on the YFi Interactive-- First Republic is down 71% for the last five days.And a lot of questions also about what has happened with banking over the last week. And if what's happened with SVB, what's happened with First Republic, if this has-- if this crisis has sort of created a two-tier system when it comes to banks.]"

Paxlovid is Pfizer’s nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets. This vote signifies that the AMDAC believes that the available data on Paxlovid supports its safety and efficacy to treat the aforementioned indication. It is to be noted that the AMDAC’s vote is not binding, but will be taken into consideration by the FDA in deciding whether to grant full approval to Paxlovid.We would like to remind the investors that the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Paxlovid in December 2021 and has since witnessed more than 10 million treatment courses, prescribed in the United States.In the past year, the shares of Pfizer have plunged 25.6% against the industry’s rise of 0.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe AMDAC vote was based on all the scientific data and the real-world evidence presented by Pfizer. This included safety and efficacy data from its phase II/III EPIC-HR study of Paxlovid in unvaccinated, non-hospitalized adults aged 18 years and older with confirmed COVID-19, who are at high risk (moderate to severe) of hospitalization or death. The study met its primary endpoint witnessing an 86% reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 in patients treated with Paxlovid within five days of symptoms onset compared with placebo.Real-world evidence presented to the AMDAC demonstrated that the clinical profile of Paxlovid post its EUA was consistent with the safety and efficacy conclusions drawn from the company’s EPIC studies.COVID-19 continues to affect people in the United States as case rates fluctuate and new variants and sub-variants emerge, regardless of virulence. As of January 2023, approximately 4,000-5,000 hospital admissions and 500-600 deaths were caused by the virus each day in the United States. More than 200 million adults in the United States are at high risk of severe COVID-19. This highlights a clear unmet medical need for treatment options.Story continuesThe FDA is expected to announce its decision in May 2023 regarding the full approval of Paxlovid. Currently, it is authorized for use in and remains available to adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Subject to approval, Paxlovid has the potential to become the first FDA-approved oral treatment for COVID-19.Pfizer is currently studying Paxlovid in an ongoing EPIC-Peds study to potentially expand its label to treat pediatric patients and expects to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA on a future date. Pfizer received marketing authorization for Paxlovid to treatfor the treatment of certain adults who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the European Union (EU) from the European Commission in February 2023.Merck MRK also launched an oral antiviral, molnupiravir which received a EUA from the FDA, in December 2021, to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults with confirmed COVID-19 aged 18 and older, at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Merck claimed that more than 4 million patients worldwide have been treated with Lagevrio (molnupiravir), playing an important role in the COVID-19 treatment landscape. Merck, along with partner Ridgeback, also recently announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency has recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for Lagevrio for the treatment of certain adults who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the EU. Following the CHMP opinion, Merck and Ridgeback are set to appeal the decision based on its phase III MOVe-OUT study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Lagevrio.In a separate press release, Pfizer and partner, Astellas Pharma, announced positive top-line data from its phase III EMBARK study evaluating Xtandi (enzalutamide) in men with non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with high-risk biochemical recurrence. Patients in the study were given either of the three combinations, Xtandi plus leuprolide, placebo plus leuprolide and Xtandi monotherapy. The companies reported that the study met its primary endpoint with statistical significance and showed clinically meaningful improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) for patients treated with Xtandi plus leuprolide versus placebo plus leuprolide.Additionally, the study met a key secondary endpoint with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in MFS for patients treated with XTANDI monotherapy versus placebo plus leuprolide. A positive trend in the overall survival rate was also observed, although the companies claim that the data is not yet mature. Several other secondary endpoints are currently being analyzed by the companies and the safety profile of Xtandi has remained constant according to past data. The company intends to conduct discussions with regulatory bodies, including the FDA, to support a potential regulatory submission for Xtandi in this indication.Pfizer Inc.

The Pfizer/Seagen transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, pending approval by Seagen shareholders and regulatory authorities.

The boards of both the companies have already approved the transaction.The FDA approved Pfizer’s calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, Zavzpret (zavegepant) nasal spray, for the acute treatment of migraine. The product is expected to be launched in July. With the approval, Zavzpret has become the first intranasal CGRP receptor antagonist indicated for the acute treatment of migraine.Story continuesPfizer and partner BioNTech announced that the FDA granted emergency use authorization to its Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a booster (fourth) dose for children aged six months through four years. The bivalent vaccine is already authorized for kids under five years as the third dose of a three-dose primary series.The FDA’s Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) voted 16 to 1 in favor of Paxlovid’s favorable benefit-risk profile.Though Paxlovid already has an emergency approval from the FDA, Pfizer is seeking a formal/full approval for the drug for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adult patients who are at high risk of progression to severe illness. The AMDAC based its vote on the totality of scientific and real-world data on the medicine. The FDA is expected to give its decision in May 2023.Sanofi to Buy Provention Bio: Sanofi announced an agreement to buy Provention Bio,  for $25.00 per share in cash, representing an equity value of approximately $2.9 billion. The acquisition will add Provention Bio’s Tzield to Sanofi’s portfolio, which is the first therapy to delay the onset of Stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D) in patients aged 8 years and older who already have Stage 2 T1D. Tzield was approved by the FDA in 2022. Sanofi already has a co-promotion agreement with Provention Bio for Tzield.  The therapy is being evaluated in phase III for the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients who are newly diagnosed with clinical T1D.Novo Nordisk &amp; Sanofi to Cut Insulin Prices: Novo Nordisk announced plans to lower prices of several pre-filled insulin pens and vials by up to 75% in the United States. The products include pre-filled pens and vials of basal (long-acting), bolus (short-acting) and pre-mix insulins, specifically Levemir, Novolin, NovoLog and NovoLog Mix 70/30. Novo Nordisk said it would slash the list price of its NovoLog insulin by 75% and that of Novolin and Levemir by 65%. It is also lowering the prices of some non-branded insulin products.Sanofi also announced a 78% cut in the list price of its most popular insulin, Lantus. Sanofi also said it is capping out-of-pocket costs for Lantus for all patients with commercial insurance, at $35. Sanofi said it will also slash the list price of its short-acting Apidra insulin.However, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi do not plan to start this until January 2024. Novo Nordisk and Sanofi’s announcements comes almost two weeks after Eli Lilly said it will cut list prices of some of its popular insulin by 70% to significantly reduce diabetes patients’ out-of-pocket costs.Merck’s Keytruda Study in Malignant Mesothelioma Meets Goal: Merck’s phase III study evaluating Keytruda plus chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma met its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). The final analysis of the study showed that Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS compared to chemotherapy alone in this patient group.

This will influence 14 S&amp;P 500 companies. The current GICS structure includes 11 sectors, which will remain unchanged.The reclassification of firms will occur across five GICS sectors. These are consumer discretionary, consumer staples, financials, industrials, and information technology. The financials and information technology sectors will see the largest impact. UBS estimates financials weight in the S&amp;P 500 will increase by 2.7% and information technology will decline by 3.2%.Moreover, food, household, and personal care products firms like Target TGT, Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR will leave the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY and join the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF XLP The new discount stores companies will constitute about 6.5% of the new staples sector, per the UBS article.Below we describe the likely impact of this reclassification on concerned sector ETFs.Sector ETFs in FocusFinance &amp; Information TechnologyFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF takes the spotlight.Eight S&amp;P 500 stocks from the data processing &amp; outsourced services subindustry will move to the newly created transaction and payment processing services subindustry in the financials sector.The securities include Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc., Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information, Global Payments Inc., FleetCor Technologies Inc. and Jack Henry &amp; Associates Inc. Each of the stocks will have larger weightings within their new sector.Visa V, Mastercard MA, and PayPal PYPL will form roughly 17% of the financials sector, larger than Berkshire Hathaway's weight (currently the largest component), per the article published on UBS.com. Digital payments have been in the front and center of consumer behavior lately.Apart from showing an increased interest in online shopping, customers are resorting to digital payments to clear their bills. Even, merchants and utility providers are increasingly advocating the same. In the ongoing earnings reporting season, PayPal beat earnings estimate while Mastercard and Visa beat on both lines.Story continuesHowever, the reclassification makes XLF a bit growth-centric. Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, on average, trade at about a 90% premium to the financials sector on a consensus forward P/E basis. This is a negative for the sector if rates continue to rise.With pure high-growth technology stocks gaining precedence in the fund, the fund will likely lose its relative value quotient. Rising rate environment will likely prove to be riskier for Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK).ConsumerConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) is another sector ETF that deserves definite mention. UBS estimates that the weight of the consumer discretionary sector in the S&amp;P 500 will likely fall by 0.5% and consumer staples will likely gain by 0.5%. Dollar Tree and Target beat on both lines in latest earnings season while Dollar General offered mixed results. UBS indicated that valuation of those discount retailers was at par with consumer staples. Hence, the impact would be minimal. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY rather now became slightly richly-valued.IndustrialsAutomatic Data Processing ADP, Broadridge Financial Solutions BR and Paychex Inc. PAYX come from industry and sectors that have upbeat Zacks ranks. These outsourcing stocks will join Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) with larger weights, post reclassification. The valuation of the sector ETF will go up slightly as ADP and PAYX trade at around 35% premium to XLI.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The growth of firms in the  cybersecurity, semiconductors, personal computer makers and smartphone sectors all slowed, and their share prices pushed lower. And yet, cloud-computing stocks managed to outperform. According to research firm Gartner, the public-cloud sector grew 20% in 2022, with the industry now worth about $500 billion, up nearly 2,000% from $26 billion a decade ago. That growth is truly impressive and indicates the speed at which companies are migrating their data to the cloud. Here are seven cloud-computing stocks that can make you a millionaire as the phenomenon continues to boom.CRMSalesforce$180.75MSFTMicrosoft$263.50SNOWSnowflake$137AMZNAmazon$94.70IBMIBM$122.15VEEVVeeva Systems$169GOOG/GOOGLAlphabet$95.50/$95.23Salesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffsSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comWe’ll start with the world’s largest cloud computing company, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).  The company, which specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software, has had a tumultuous time over the past year, having been targeted by several activist investors and having endured the departure of several of its most senior executives. The turmoil has impacted CRM stock, pushing its price down nearly 60% between November 2021 and December 2022.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe good news is that CRM stock appears to have bottomed last December at $126.34 per share. The company’s stock jumped 16% in one day after it delivered better-than-expected earnings and issued strong guidance. Earlier this month, Salesforce reported fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $1.68 compared to the $1.36 that Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected. Its  Q4 revenue jumped 14% year-over-year to $8.38 billion, versus analysts’ average estimate of $7.99 billion.Salesforce also announced that it was raising its stock buyback program to $20 billion, up from $10 billion previously. Looking forward, Salesforce said that it expects to report earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.61 per share and revenue of $8.16 billion to $8.18 billion for the current quarter.Story continuesThat guidance was better than the $1.32 in earnings per share and $8.05 billion of revenue that analysts, on average, had anticipated. So it looks, for the time being, like Salesforce may have turned a corner.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comAll the news pertaining to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) these days is about the company’s pivot to artificial intelligence, especially after it sunk $10 billion into ChatGPT creator OpenAI. However, all the hype surrounding AI obscures the fact that Microsoft remains a major player in the cloud-computing space through its Azure unit.According to market research firm Statista, Microsoft currently controls 23% of the global cloud infrastructure services market, second only to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, which controls 32% of the market.The revenue of Microsoft’s main cloud unit, Azure, along with the sales generated by the firm’s “other cloud services,” jumped a cumulative 31% year-over-year last quarter.  The company, however did lower its overall forward guidance, saying it now expects revenue for its current first quarter of $50.5 billion to $51.5 billion. That is below the $52 billion of revenue that analysts, on average, had penciled in for the current quarter.MSFT’s current slowdown, however,  is temporary for sure and not unique to Microsoft. But over  the long term, the tech giant and its stock remain a buy.  Meanwhile,  Microsoft’s commitment to cloud computing has not changed, and It remains a force in the space.MSFT stock is down 10% over the past 12 months.Snowflake (SNOW)Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.Source: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) offers cloud-based data storage and analytics services that are often referred to as “data-as-a-service.” The company had the misfortune to go public in September 2020 during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic. After initially running up 63% and peaking at just under $400 a share, SNOW stock pulled back 72% to bottom at $110 a share in June of last year.Despite the lack of profits, Snowflake remains in red-hot growth mode. In fiscal 2023, Snowflake’s revenue jumped 69% year-over-year. to $2.1 billionThat brings the company’s revenue growth over the past three years to 680%.The company also has a number of notable fans, including famed investor Warren Buffett who owns more than 6 million shares of the company, a stake worth nearly $850 million. In fact, Buffett got in on Snowflake’s IPO, something he almost never does. Buy the dip of SNOW.Amazon (AMZN)An image of pills surrounding the Amazon (AMZN( logo representing ONEM stock.Source: MACH Photos / Shutterstock.comAs already mentioned, Amazon Web Services is the global leader of the cloud infrastructure services market. Increasingly, Amazon Web Services is a primary focus of the e-commerce giant as the company continues to diversify its business.In the company’s most recently reported quarter, Amazon Web Services earned $21.4 billion, which was just under the $21.87 billion that analysts, on average, had expected. During the final quarter of 2022, AWS grew 20% year-over-year, down from annualized growth of 27.5% in the previous quarter.Despite the slowdown of AWS’ growth, Amazon is not pivoting away from the cloud anytime soon. In fact, Amazon Web Services is now expanding to target artificial intelligence developers.AMZN stock has declined 38% over the past 12 months.IBM (IBM)International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) has many business segments, including a sizable one that is focused on cloud computing. Last month, the company unveiled a new supercomputer that is based in the cloud, leading to speculation that IBM was developing a real-life Skynet, the computer system that triggers Armageddon in “The Terminator” film franchise.Histrionics aside, IBM is a formidable player in the cloud computing space, primarily through its Red Hat subsidiary that provides open-source software products to enterprises around the world.The company also has a cloud business that’s dedicated to the financial services sector. IBM today works with more than 130 financial firms through its “IBM Financial Services Cloud Council.” IBM says it is working to incorporate greater compliance and security into its cloud offerings.That’s exactly what financial firms want.Veeva Systems (VEEV)Why Xenetic Biosciences Just Surged 28 PercentSource: ShutterstockVeeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) is a lesser-known cloud computing company with a niche focus. Founded in 2007 and publicly traded since 2013, Veeva Systems is a cloud-computing company that focuses on the pharmaceutical and life-sciences industries.The company refers to itself as a “software as a service in the life science industry.” And while it is lesser known than the other names on this list, VEEV stock has been a quiet outperformer over the past decade.So far in 2023, VEEV stock has gained 5%. Over the past five years, the stock has increased an impressive 125%.Since its market debut ten years ago, the share price has nearly tripled. Key to the company’s success is that its cloud-based solutions are extremely valuable and sticky with its clients.That’s because Veeva’s offerings allow its offerings to succeed in the heavily regulated, capital intensive healthcare industry.Also, companies cannot switch their cloud-based software providers without disrupting their businesses and incurring high costs. So Veeva System’s customers are likely to stick with the cloud company.Alphabet (GOOG / GOOGL)GOOG stock: letters spelling out googleSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.comAlphabet  (NASDAQ:GOOG / NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a bit of an outlier in the cloud-computing space. The firm’s Google Cloud business is growing at a brisk clip but remains unprofitable.With a current market share of 10%, Google Cloud is in third place globally behind Amazon and Microsoft. Google Cloud lost nearly $700 million in last year’s third quarter alone. However, Google Cloud is growing, as its sales and revenue have been climbing forseveral years .And Alphabet remains fully committed to its cloud offering. While the company has closed other unprofitable divisions such as its Stadia video game unit, the tech titan continues to invest in the growth of Google Cloud, primarily through acquisitions.Alphabet acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant last September for $5.4 billion, marking one of its biggest ever purchases. Mandiant promises to bolster Google Cloud’s security functions at a time when remote workers have grown to 60% of the U.S. workforce.GOOGL stock is down 25% over the last 12 months, giving it an attractive price-earnings ratio of 20.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in MSFT and GOOGL.

A brewing banking crisis is adding fuel to the already weak economy mired by stubborn inflation and Fed's hawkish stance. Many economists project that the United States could slip into recession sooner than expected.With consumers rather downbeat about economic outlook, they are less likely to spend heavily on high-ticket items, which may hurt vehicle sales. Additionally, high commodity and labor costs are adversely impacting the margins of the industry participants. While robust deliveries of electric vehicles (EV) are acting as a booster, the overall prospects of the industry don't appear bright, at least for the near term.Nonetheless, we recommend keeping a close eye on three auto giants namely General Motors, PACCAR and Harley-Davidson, which are better positioned to brave the multiple industry challenges.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Industry?Intensified Economic Uncertainty: At a time when the U.S. economy is already mired in uncertainty amid Fed's aggressive rate hikes, the sudden collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank has just added to the gloom. The banking crisis has prompted Goldman Sachs to ratchet down U.S. GDP forecasts. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs lowered its U.S. growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 1.2% for 2023. The investment banking giant also raised the probability of a U.S. recession from 25% to 35%.The highly cyclical Domestic Auto industry is likely to feel the heat of a fragile economy. Demand for vehicles is expected to cool off as consumers are gradually becoming apprehensive about buying high-ticket items when recessionary fears are growing. While auto sales in 2022 fell to a decade low, primarily owing to supply chain issues, this year, the industry is likely to suffer from macroeconomic challenges. The supply crunch is most likely to morph into a demand slowdown in 2023.High Commodity &amp; Operational Costs: Prices of raw materials like steel, aluminum and others are soaring and adversely impacting the gross margins. Commodity inflation, although gradually abating, is far from over. Most automakers have already warned that high raw materials and labor costs will remain a major headwind for quite some time. Manufacturing inefficiencies and logistic challenges are expected to keep playing spoilsports. Additionally, massive R&amp;D expenses for the development of high-tech cars would also likely strain near-term cash flows.Soaring EV Popularity: Amid all the gloom and doom, buyers' inclination toward green cars is a silver lining. Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles' adoption by both automakers as well as customers. Legacy automakers are going the extra mile to gain a strong foothold in this red-hot e-mobility space. Demand for electric cars is off the charts. While sales of passenger vehicles declined last year, EV sales in the country shot up 65%. In fact, sales of EVs topped 5% of U.S. new vehicle sales for the first time in 2022. The EV momentum is likely to offer some respite.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 20-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it in the bottom 33% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 20.5% over the past three months.Despite the industry's tepid near-term prospects, we will present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio. Before that, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 40.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector's decline of 11.5% and 34%, respectively, over the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 11.27X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 11.87X and the sector's 12.21X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 53.78X, as low as 8.44X and at a median of 15.05X.3 Stocks Worth Holding OntoGeneral Motors: This legacy U.S. automaker's hot-selling brands in America, like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra, are driving its top line. General Motors' massive EV push is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. This year, it will have nine EV models in the North America market. Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 are expected to buoy top-line growth.General Motors has enough cash on the balance sheet to weather short-term headwinds and navigate economic cycles. The firm had total automotive liquidity of $39.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, including $24.4 billion of cash/cash equivalents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM's 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 3.2%. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 10 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 13 cents over the past 30 days. General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PACCAR: PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising XF, XG and XD models, augurs well. New launches have improved the company's product mix. PACCAR's accelerated efforts toward electrification and connected vehicle services are praiseworthy.Continued growth in the aftermarket parts—which is a high margin and a less cyclic business— thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine bodes well.High truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts results. The company's strong balance sheet is complemented by A+/A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR's 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 13% and 6.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 13 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has increased by a cent over the past 30 days. PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of A.Harley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle maker in the United States is reaping the benefits of its Hardwire strategic plan.The Hardwire strategy aims at long-term profitability and growth through refreshed product offerings. In sync with its long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, Harley-Davidson will be focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends.As an integral part of its Hardwire strategy, Harley-Davidson launched an online platform for its used motorcycles, namely HD-1, last year. The H-D1 marketplace platform is also set to fuel the company's prospects. The LiveWire unit—dedicated to e-bikes— will particularly help the company gain a solid foothold in a sportier market environment with its innovative and differentiated offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG's 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 7%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 4 cents over the past seven days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 5 cents over the past seven days. Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of A.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The collapse of SVB rattled investors’ confidence, as they started pulling their assets and deposits out of the bank soon after the crisis. According to a report by Bloomberg, top executives at 15 banks lost $267 million in wealth in the span of days following the collapse. The rippling effects of this fallout were felt in Europe as well.As investors registered their fears regarding the fallout, President Biden assured the nation of the banking system’s safety. He announced that investors will have access to their deposits whenever they need. In a joint statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg also attempted to boost investor confidence by offering loans to banks for up to one year. Here are some comments from the Fed:“This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.”Despite government intervention, bank stocks continue to fall in value. The S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index declined by 12.88% in the past five days, compared with a 2.28% return of the S&amp;P 500.Considering this slump in the banking sector, wealth advisors recommend putting money across different asset classes. Patrick Dwyer, managing director at NewEdge Wealth, spoke to CNBC about possible investment strategies to follow. He asserted that investors should put money into Treasuries and money markets as they can offer around 5% risk-free return during elevated interest rate periods. Similarly, Michael Zeuner, managing partner at WE Family Offices, also highlighted the importance of cash in this environment. He mentioned:Story continues“For so many years, cash was just not an interesting investment. It was paying zero, so people weren’t really paying attention to cash. Over the last year, as rates came up, and as the fear of a recession kicked in, a lot of families started to take some risk off the table. It went into cash. And so cash, from an investment perspective, [has] all of a sudden become a much more important part of the portfolio.”During such economic environments, the main focus of investors is to generate stable and regular income. Investing in dividend stocks is one of the best ways to achieve this goal as these companies reward investors with monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts.Keeping in mind the current situation of the banking sector, we will discuss the best bank dividend stocks in this article. Some of these companies include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

(NASDAQ:ISRG)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-120046677.html,1679140846.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) recent performance, when its stock has declined 10% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Intuitive Surgical's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intuitive Surgical is:12% = US$1.3b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Intuitive Surgical's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo begin with, Intuitive Surgical seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 12% seen over the past five years by Intuitive Surgical.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Intuitive Surgical's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Intuitive Surgical is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Intuitive Surgical Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Intuitive Surgical doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Intuitive Surgical's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. From the palm of your hand, to your refrigerator, and your car, technology is everywhere. Alongside disrupting consumers' lives, tech has also transformed industries and shaken up the way in which firms manage their plants and warehouses. Robots and drones are everywhere, from the hospital bed to the factory floor and the skies of a warzone, and powering all this innovation is the automation sector.Before we get to the nitty gritty of the industry, it is important to take stock of what automation really means. According to Electrical Technology, industrial automation is a step beyond simple mechanization. While mechanization involves operators running machines on the factory floor, automation replaces them with logic boards that come preprogrammed with commands instead. However automation is not limited to industrial applications, and neither is it a new concept. You'd be surprised to learn that one of the first applications of automation came in 1892 in the form of the telephone switchboard, which automated the process of connecting phone calls between users.Since then, the industry has rapidly evolved. As of 2022 the global industrial application market was worth $206 billion according to research from Fortune Business Insights. From 2022 until 2039, the research firm expects that the sector will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% to sit at an estimated $395 billion at the end of the forecast period. Fortune Business Insights believes that the pairing of digital technology into commercial operations and a growing interlinkage of firms within the sector will drive this growth. It adds that Europe was the dominating player in the industrial automation industry in 2021, as it accounted for $61.8 billion of the $192 billion market, but adds that Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region due to rapid industrialization.Story continuesWhile so far we have talked about industrial automation, one area that you might not know that is being affected by this change is the finance industry. Investment bank UBS, which deals with countless client orders for stock trading, is using artificial intelligence to sort through these requests. According to Deloitte, this has reduced the time that it takes for UBS to sort these allocation requests by a stunning 96%, as it has dropped from an earlier 45 minutes to now just two minutes. Deloitte further expects that up to 861,000 public sector jobs within the U.K. will be replaced by automation by 2030, allowing a £15 billion cost reduction compared to 2015. This will be done through a subsegment of the automation market called Robotic Process Automation (RPA). This segment is purely software based, with the software robots aiding firms in decision making and taking the workload off of human employees.Finally, alongside software robots, hardware robots have also made their mark. One of the strongest examples of this is Boston Dynamics, whose robot dog, Spot, is already aiding a variety of sectors with their daily operations. These range from SpaceX using the robot to manage chemicals around its launch pad, to the British Royal Air Force using it to navigate through rough terrain during patrols.Best Automation Stocks To Buy NowImage by Computerizer from PixabayAnother robot that has made waves is the one made by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). This is used to aid surgeons during their surgeries. Surgeries are among the most complex operations performed by humans, and during a recent earnings call, Intuit's head of investor relations Mr. Brian King commented on the current state of the industry as he outlined:Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a three-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the US and 22% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The US procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, US procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the US, fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year, compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in UK, Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the UK, we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy. Turning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid, with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter. Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery, with strong early stage growth in colon resection and hysterectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures.Today, we'll look at some of the best automation stocks that are on hedge funds' watchlist, with their top picks being NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NYSE: BXP) may be affected by the problems regional banks are experiencing, investors dumped enough of the real estate investment trust’s (REIT) shares Tuesday to take it to a new 52-week low. That it continued lower while the benchmark REIT exchange-traded funds (ETFs) found support is a concern.According to its website, Boston Properties is “the largest publicly traded owner, developer and manager of premier workplaces in the United States.” The real estate investment trust runs properties in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.The REIT’s market capitalization is relatively big for the sector at $9.04 billion. Shares trade at 1.37 times book value with a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.9. The price-to-free-cash-flow metric is better than many at 21.49. Funds from operations over the past five years grew by 13% and by 70% over the most recent 12-month period.Boston Properties’ long-term debt exceeds shareholder equity by 2.26 times, which may be excessive for value investors.Shares are actively bought and sold with an average daily volume of 1.42 million.The company pays a dividend of 7.34%.In early January, Deutsche Bank AG downgraded its opinion of Boston Properties from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $91 to $74.The daily chart is here:From an early February high of $78 to the mid-March low of $52 amounts to a quick drop of 33%. Note that the selling bars (reddish, below the price bars) are the heaviest on the chart. It’s a bearish look that Boston Properties trades so far below both the downtrending 50-day moving average (the blue line) and the downtrending 200-day moving average (the red line).The monthly chart looks like this:The most troubling aspect is that the price has slumped to convincingly below the lows of March and October 2020. It’s not attractive that shares trade below the downtrending 50- and 200-week moving averages.

Also, its unsecured senior debt ratings of BBB+ from S&amp;P Global Ratings and Baa1 from Moody’s render it favorable access to the debt market.With ample financial flexibility, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities.BXP’s current cash flow growth is projected at 30.59% compared with 9.37% growth estimated for the industry. Further, its trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) is 10.31% compared with the industry’s average of 3.60%. This reflects that the company is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Nonetheless, a choppy office market environment is likely to soften the demand for the company’s properties, hurting leasing volume in the near term.Also, the elevated supply of office properties weighs on Boston Properties. Intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate limits its ability to retain tenants at relatively higher rents and dents its pricing power.Interest rate hikes are likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting the company’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 20.8% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s fall of 0.3%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Alexandria Real Estate Equities ARE, Terreno Realty TRNO, each currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and Service Properties Trust SVC, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This will influence 14 S&amp;P 500 companies. The current GICS structure includes 11 sectors, which will remain unchanged.The reclassification of firms will occur across five GICS sectors. These are consumer discretionary, consumer staples, financials, industrials, and information technology. The financials and information technology sectors will see the largest impact. UBS estimates financials weight in the S&amp;P 500 will increase by 2.7% and information technology will decline by 3.2%.Moreover, food, household, and personal care products firms like Target TGT, Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR will leave the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY and join the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF XLP The new discount stores companies will constitute about 6.5% of the new staples sector, per the UBS article.Below we describe the likely impact of this reclassification on concerned sector ETFs.Sector ETFs in FocusFinance &amp; Information TechnologyFinancial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF takes the spotlight.Eight S&amp;P 500 stocks from the data processing &amp; outsourced services subindustry will move to the newly created transaction and payment processing services subindustry in the financials sector.The securities include Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc., Fiserv Inc., Fidelity National Information, Global Payments Inc., FleetCor Technologies Inc. and Jack Henry &amp; Associates Inc. Each of the stocks will have larger weightings within their new sector.Visa V, Mastercard MA, and PayPal PYPL will form roughly 17% of the financials sector, larger than Berkshire Hathaway's weight (currently the largest component), per the article published on UBS.com. Digital payments have been in the front and center of consumer behavior lately.Apart from showing an increased interest in online shopping, customers are resorting to digital payments to clear their bills. Even, merchants and utility providers are increasingly advocating the same. In the ongoing earnings reporting season, PayPal beat earnings estimate while Mastercard and Visa beat on both lines.Story continuesHowever, the reclassification makes XLF a bit growth-centric. Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, on average, trade at about a 90% premium to the financials sector on a consensus forward P/E basis. This is a negative for the sector if rates continue to rise.With pure high-growth technology stocks gaining precedence in the fund, the fund will likely lose its relative value quotient. Rising rate environment will likely prove to be riskier for Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK).ConsumerConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) is another sector ETF that deserves definite mention. UBS estimates that the weight of the consumer discretionary sector in the S&amp;P 500 will likely fall by 0.5% and consumer staples will likely gain by 0.5%. Dollar Tree and Target beat on both lines in latest earnings season while Dollar General offered mixed results. UBS indicated that valuation of those discount retailers was at par with consumer staples. Hence, the impact would be minimal. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF XLY rather now became slightly richly-valued.IndustrialsAutomatic Data Processing ADP, Broadridge Financial Solutions BR and Paychex Inc. PAYX come from industry and sectors that have upbeat Zacks ranks. These outsourcing stocks will join Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLI) with larger weights, post reclassification. The valuation of the sector ETF will go up slightly as ADP and PAYX trade at around 35% premium to XLI.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:MAR) has continued to showcase its resilience by delivering an exceptional performance. Despite the challenges posed by inflation, the company's operations remain robust. This can be attributed to its efficiency and growth in business and leisure travel, which has driven a strong recovery.However, it is important for the hospitality company to not become complacent, as the possibility of a recession may hinder its progress. Nonetheless, the company's solid fundamentals are the bedrock of its success in an unpredictable market. Its cash inflows remain steady, providing ample coverage for borrowings and dividends.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MAR. Click here to check it out. MAR 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MARPeter Lynch Chart of MARMarriott is back to pre-pandemic levelsDespite its stature as an industry giant, Marriott was not immune to the effects of the pandemic as restrictions caused a significant decline in its financials. However, the company has proven to be resilient.Thanks to its prudent asset management, the company experienced a clear upswing last year. That momentum is expected to continue.In February, Marriott reported its adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 came in at $1.96, surpassing the prior-year quarter's adjusted earnings of $1.30. Quarterly revenue of $5.92 billion reflects a 33.2% increase from the previous year. The strong top-line growth was driven by increased lodging demand and unit growth, with base management and franchise fee revenues totaling $287 million and $658 million.Additionally, other non-revenue per available room-related franchise fees contributed to the growth, with $215 million reported compared to $186 million in the year-ago quarter, largely due to solid co-brand credit card fee contributions.Marriott's RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties rose by 4.6% in constant dollars compared to 2019, driven primarily by a 12.8% increase in the average daily rate. However, occupancy declined by 5.1% from 2019 levels.Story continuesIn Asia Pacific (excluding China), RevPAR increased by 5.5%, with a 4.8% decline in occupancy but a 12.8% increase in ADR. Comparable system-wide RevPAR in China fell by 42.3% compared to 2019. On an international scale, RevPAR increased by 3.4%, with an 8.3% decline in occupancy and a 17.3% increase in ADR.RevPAR increased by 7.4% in Europe, while the Caribbean &amp; Latin America experienced a 27.6% increase from 2019 levels. The fourth quarter saw adjusted Ebitda of $1.09 billion, up from $741 million in the prior-year quarter.In the fourth quarter, Marriott incurred $107 million in net interest expense, up from $91 million in the same period of the previous year. The increased interest expense primarily drove this rise from higher debt levels.As of the end of 2022, Marriott's total debt was $10.1 billion, while its cash and equivalents amounted to $507 million. In comparison, the company had $10.1 billion in debt and $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of 2021. Nonetheless, Marriott has the financial capacity to manage its debt burden, as evidenced by its free cash flow of $2.03 billion at the end of the latest quarter, compared to $994 million a year earlier.The company's solid financial position enabled it to return $2.9 billion to shareholders in 2022 through share buybacks and dividends.Digging further into the numbersMarriott's higher-priced brands are experiencing a recovery, despite the usual seasonal decline in demand during the winter months. This trend is evident across the Ritz-Carlton brand, where RevPAR decreased from the second quarter of 2022 but remained higher than the previous year for the three months ending Dec. 31, 2022.Additionally, the average daily rate at the Ritz-Carlton during the fourth quarter of 2021 was $519.73, which saw a slight decrease to $516.85 during the same period in 2022. This suggests the revenue growth is driven by demand rather than price increases, as evidenced by the continuing rise in RevPAR despite the stagnant ADR.Over this same period, occupancy rates for the Ritz-Carlton also increased from 58.5% to 63.8%. Notably, the occupancy rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 72.9%. In my opinion, there is still potential for the hotel chain's occupancy rates to increase further, which could lead to continued growth in RevPAR going forward.A busy yearMarriott International is one of the leading hospitality companies, but is far from resting on its laurels, as evidenced by its averaging two agreements per day in 2022, a 21% increase from the previous year.The company has continued to progress in 2023, expanding its reach by opening new hotels in various countries, including Europe, the Middle East and Thailand. Given the lucrative nature of the midscale hotels market in the current economic conditions, it inked a timely acquisition agreement with City Express last October.The company's acquisition of the City Express portfolio has gotten the nod from Mexico's Federal Economic Competition Commission. The deal includes 17,000 rooms, allowing Marriott to expand into 70 cities in Mexico and three Latin American countries. Following this acquisition, the firm's share of the Caribbean and Latin American market will grow by over 40%, establishing it as the leading hotel company in that area.In addition, Marriott is expanding its presence in luxury destinations through a series of recent partnership agreements. The company will build three hotels on Saudi Arabia's Sindalah Island, including two Luxury Collections properties, one- to four-bedroom residences and an Autograph Collection Hotel with 66 rooms and villas.The company has also agreed to rebrand the Westin Siray Bay Resort &amp; Spa as The Ritz-Carlton on Phuket Island and transform the Hotel Grande Bretagne on Lake Como into another Ritz-Carlton property.These projects are set to open between 2024 and 2026. They are expected to contribute to the company's growth, which has seen a 28.8% increase in revenue per available room globally in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is projected to increase by 30% in 2023.A safe dividend at a discountIn light of the pandemic, Marriott, like many other copanies, made the difficult decision to suspend its dividend payment. It has since resumed them, however, as the number of cases began to decrease.Since reinstating its payouts last year, the hospitality giant has steadily increased its distribution. However, it is important to note that its dividend yield remains modest at 0.88%. This places its dividend yield performance lower then 77.93% of companies in the same industry and is notably lower than the industry median of 2.19%.However, Marriott's dividend payout ratio range over the past 10 years, with a minimum of 0.14, a median of 0.31 and a maximum of 0.49, is a good sign for investors. This indicates the company has consistently returned a significant portion of its profits to shareholders as dividends. With the current dividend payout ratio of 0.14, Marriott also maintains its dividend payments to shareholders.Compared to other travel and leisure industry companies, Marriott's dividend payout ratio of 0.14 is ranked better than 81.78%. This indicates the hotel operator is in a good position to provide value to its shareholders by consistently paying dividends. Furthermore, the industry median of 0.35 is higher than Marriott's dividend payout ratio, which indicates it is potentially retaining more earnings to reinvest in the business to drive growth further.Overall, Marriott's consistent dividend payout ratio over the past decade and its position in the industry's top quartile in terms of payout ratio is a good indication of the company's financial strength and commitment to providing value to its shareholders.Macroeconomic headwinds remain the biggest thorn in its sideThe multinational hospitality giant is experiencing a robust recovery that has surpassed pre-pandemic levels.The U.S. Travel Association Consumer Quarterly Tracker by Ipsos reports that 52% of Americans plan to travel for leisure in the first half of 2023, with 23% indicating they will travel more than they did in 2022.Further, the United Nations World Tourism Organization predicts that international travel will rebound to more than 80% of pre-pandemic levels, which is expected to benefit Marriott, which has over 8,000 properties in 139 countries.China's relaxation of travel restrictions and lockdowns has already positively impacted Marriott's search history, with an uptick in leisure demand during the Chinese New Year, according to Chief Financial Officer Kathleen Oberg.However, Marriott must remain vigilant in the face of inflationary pressures that have raised prices for gas, hotels and flights. The potential impact of an upcoming recession also threatens its recovery. As such, Marriott International may face a potential risk of reduced booking demand due to worsening economic conditions.While there has been a significant rebound in demand during the post-Covid recovery, there is a possibility that demand could plateau due to rising prices, resulting in a revenue growth ceiling for the summer months.TakeawayMarriott International has demonstrated robust revenue growth, defying the effects of inflationary pressures, across its higher-end and mid-priced brands.It is a good stock as the travel industry continues to recover from the pandemic. As one of the largest hotel chains in the world, Marriott is well positioned to benefit from the increase in travel demand.Moreover, Marriott's diversified portfolio of hotels and brands and its strong loyalty program provide a competitive advantage. The company's financial strength and consistent dividend payments make it a potentially attractive investment option for investors looking for stability and growth potential in the travel industry.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. From the palm of your hand, to your refrigerator, and your car, technology is everywhere. Alongside disrupting consumers' lives, tech has also transformed industries and shaken up the way in which firms manage their plants and warehouses. Robots and drones are everywhere, from the hospital bed to the factory floor and the skies of a warzone, and powering all this innovation is the automation sector.Before we get to the nitty gritty of the industry, it is important to take stock of what automation really means. According to Electrical Technology, industrial automation is a step beyond simple mechanization. While mechanization involves operators running machines on the factory floor, automation replaces them with logic boards that come preprogrammed with commands instead. However automation is not limited to industrial applications, and neither is it a new concept. You'd be surprised to learn that one of the first applications of automation came in 1892 in the form of the telephone switchboard, which automated the process of connecting phone calls between users.Since then, the industry has rapidly evolved. As of 2022 the global industrial application market was worth $206 billion according to research from Fortune Business Insights. From 2022 until 2039, the research firm expects that the sector will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8% to sit at an estimated $395 billion at the end of the forecast period. Fortune Business Insights believes that the pairing of digital technology into commercial operations and a growing interlinkage of firms within the sector will drive this growth. It adds that Europe was the dominating player in the industrial automation industry in 2021, as it accounted for $61.8 billion of the $192 billion market, but adds that Asia Pacific will be the fastest growing region due to rapid industrialization.Story continuesWhile so far we have talked about industrial automation, one area that you might not know that is being affected by this change is the finance industry. Investment bank UBS, which deals with countless client orders for stock trading, is using artificial intelligence to sort through these requests. According to Deloitte, this has reduced the time that it takes for UBS to sort these allocation requests by a stunning 96%, as it has dropped from an earlier 45 minutes to now just two minutes. Deloitte further expects that up to 861,000 public sector jobs within the U.K. will be replaced by automation by 2030, allowing a £15 billion cost reduction compared to 2015. This will be done through a subsegment of the automation market called Robotic Process Automation (RPA). This segment is purely software based, with the software robots aiding firms in decision making and taking the workload off of human employees.Finally, alongside software robots, hardware robots have also made their mark. One of the strongest examples of this is Boston Dynamics, whose robot dog, Spot, is already aiding a variety of sectors with their daily operations. These range from SpaceX using the robot to manage chemicals around its launch pad, to the British Royal Air Force using it to navigate through rough terrain during patrols.Best Automation Stocks To Buy NowImage by Computerizer from PixabayAnother robot that has made waves is the one made by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). This is used to aid surgeons during their surgeries. Surgeries are among the most complex operations performed by humans, and during a recent earnings call, Intuit's head of investor relations Mr. Brian King commented on the current state of the industry as he outlined:Overall procedure growth for the full year 2022 was 18% and increased 15% on a three-year compound annual growth basis. Overall procedure growth was comprised of 16% growth in the US and 22% growth outside of the US. In the US, fourth quarter 2022 procedures grew 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 18% last quarter. The US procedure growth rate reflected a favorable comparison to the quarter a year ago, given the impact of the Omicron variant in December of last year. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, US procedure growth was 13%. Outside of the US, fourth quarter procedure volume grew approximately 18% year-over-year, compared to 28% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 24% last quarter. On a three-year compound annual growth basis, procedure growth was 19%. Turning to Europe. Procedure growth in the quarter was led by strong growth in UK, Germany and Italy. In the regions noted, procedure growth outside of urology was strong in general surgery and gynecology categories. Specifically in the UK, we experienced strong early-stage growth in colorectal surgery and continued strong growth in hysterectomy. Turning to Asia. Growth outside of China continued to be solid, with notable strength in capital and procedure growth in Japan. Procedure growth in Korea was healthy and India and Taiwan continue to experience strong early-stage growth. In Japan, as Jamie noted earlier, 51 systems were placed in the country, the most in a single quarter. Overall procedure growth in Japan for the quarter was led by general surgery, with strong early stage growth in colon resection and hysterectomy and also in urology with newly reimbursed nephrectomy procedures.Today, we'll look at some of the best automation stocks that are on hedge funds' watchlist, with their top picks being NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CHRW)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-c-h-142141962.html,1679062901,STORY,['CHRW'],"[Let's talk about the popular C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$105 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$90.01. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether C.H. Robinson Worldwide's current trading price of US$98.21 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at C.H. Robinson Worldwide’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide Is C.H. Robinson Worldwide Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 26%, trading at US$98.21 compared to my intrinsic value of $77.67. This means that the opportunity to buy C.H. Robinson Worldwide at a good price has disappeared! In addition to this, it seems like C.H. Robinson Worldwide’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from C.H. Robinson Worldwide?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, it is expected to deliver a highly negative earnings growth in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe CHRW is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to reduce your total portfolio risk. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CHRW for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Its price has risen beyond its true value, on top of a negative future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?If you want to dive deeper into C.H. Robinson Worldwide, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Canadian Solar (CSIQ) earns a Zacks Rank #2 four days from its next quarterly earnings release on March 21, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.98 a share.Canadian Solar's Earnings ESP sits at 102.76%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.98 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.48.CSIQ is one of just a large database of Oils-Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP).Helmerich &amp; Payne, which is readying to report earnings on April 26, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.10 a share, and HP is 40 days out from its next earnings report.For Helmerich &amp; Payne, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 is 3.77%.Story continuesCSIQ and HP's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

IDCC recently secured a favorable verdict from UK’s High Court for its longstanding licensing dispute against Lenovo. The litigation is based on the fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms of a license for InterDigital's patents and has featured five separate trials since the lawsuit was first filed against Lenovo in 2019.Per the court ruling, the China-based technology firm is liable to pay about $138.7 million as a “lumpsum” compensation for all the past and future sales of mobile devices from 2007 until the end of 2023. The court further observed that previous offers of $337 million for a six-year license to InterDigital’s portfolio of 3G, 4G and 5G patents were not made on FRAND terms and it will determine in due course of time whether any additional interest payments were required.The verdict reinforces InterDigital’s patent licensing rights and is likely to thwart any potential breaches in the future. Although the company has welcomed the favorable verdict, it intends to appeal against certain aspects of the decision that it feels do not truly reflect its licensing program.InterDigital’s commitment to licensing its broad portfolio of technologies to wireless terminal equipment makers, which allows it to expand its core market capability, is laudable. It has leading companies, such as Huawei, Samsung, LG and Apple, under its licensing agreements. Consequently, the company expects to generate solid recurring revenues from the patent licensing business in the forthcoming quarters as well.InterDigital’s global footprint, diversified product portfolio and ability to penetrate different markets are impressive. Apart from the company’s strong portfolio of wireless technology solutions, the addition of technologies related to sensors, user interface and video to its offerings is likely to drive significant value, considering the massive size of the market it licenses. Furthermore, the company remains committed to pursuing acquisitions to drive its product portfolio and boost organic growth.The company is focused on pursuing agreements with unlicensed customers in the handset and consumer electronics markets. InterDigital aims to become a leading designer and developer of technology solutions and innovation for the mobile industry, IoT and allied technology areas by leveraging its research and development capabilities, technological know-how and rich industry experience. At the same time, it intends to enhance its licensing revenue base by adding licensees and expanding into adjacent technology areas that align with its intellectual property position.Additionally, more and more companies are increasingly offering the work-from-home option to employees to ensure their safety and well-being. Several firms are also providing a secure and connected workplace setup through quick onboarding and enablement services to support the seamless continuity of businesses and enable employees to fulfill their professional obligations. This, in turn, is likely to create new revenue-generating opportunities for InterDigital, as humans become solely dependent on the digital platform to stay connected not only for their professional lives but also for online education, shopping, dining and entertainment.The stock has gained 15.1% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 17.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInterDigital currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Key PicksArista Networks, Inc. ANET, sporting a Zacks Rank #1, is likely to benefit from strong momentum and diversification across its top verticals and product lines. The company has a software-driven, data-centric approach to help customers build their cloud architecture and enhance their cloud experience. Arista has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.5% and delivered an earnings surprise of 12.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.It holds a leadership position in 100-gigabit Ethernet switching share in port for the high-speed datacenter segment. Arista is increasingly gaining market traction in 200- and 400-gig high-performance switching products and remains well-positioned for healthy growth in data-driven cloud networking business with proactive platforms and predictive operations.Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 7% and delivered an earnings surprise of 1.6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Juniper is leveraging the 400-gig cycle to capture hyperscale switching opportunities inside the data center. The company is set to capitalize on the increasing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence.Deutsche Telekom AG DTEGY, carrying a Zacks Rank #2, is likely to benefit from the accretive post-merger integration of T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprite in the United States, in which it owns about 43% stake. The removal of forced cable TV access in multiple dwelling units in Germany through telecom legislation is likely to help Deutsche Telekom expand its broadband market.Moreover, an aggressive fiber rollout strategy across the country is expected to augment its domestic market hold. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings for Deutsche Telekom has been revised 21.8% upward over the past year. It has a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth expectation of 15.7%. The stock has gained 38% in the past year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy Is Devon Energy Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.79bUS$3.50bUS$3.33bUS$3.30bUS$2.82bUS$2.71bUS$2.65bUS$2.63bUS$2.63bUS$2.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ -3.87%Est @ -2.09%Est @ -0.84%Est @ 0.03%Est @ 0.64% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.6% US$3.5kUS$2.9kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.6%– 2.1%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 9.6%)10= US$15bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$34b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$46.2, the company appears about fair value at a 11% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Devon Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.260. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Devon EnergyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatDividends are not covered by cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Devon Energy, we've compiled three important elements you should assess:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 3 warning signs for Devon Energy (1 is a bit unpleasant!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does DVN's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

When there is market uncertainty, the right way to park your funds is in dividend stocks since they keep your money safe and will ensure healthy and consistent cash inflows. If you are here to generate passive income, you need to look out for dividend growth and not the dividend yield. Several companies pay regular dividends, and reward investors, but not every company will pay handsomely each quarter. Let’s take a look at those that do. Here are the three dividend stocks that will pay you quarterly.MMM3M$103.28LMTLockheed Martin$477.45DVNDevon Energy$50.333M (MMM)a photo of 3M protective masksSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com3M (NYSE:MMM) is a solid dividend stock that has increased its dividend by 0.7% in the recent dividend declaration in February. The company paid a dividend of $1.5 this quarter and an annual dividend of $5.96 in 2022. It also returned $4.8 billion to the shareholders last year through share repurchases and dividends. And it is one company that has over 100 years of uninterrupted dividend payments. This is one of the most attractive dividend stocks that pay quarterly. 3M stock is currently trading at $104, down 27% in the year. However, the stock has the potential to bounce back once the demand for its products improves.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor 2023, the company expects a 3% decline in organic sales growth and the selling prices up towards the low single digits. However, it aims for an adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $9. While the company is facing a tough market and macroeconomic environment right now, there is a high chance of improvement in the second half of the year. The earnings might not have been impressive, but it is still a solid long-term investment.3M is a company with healthy financials and a strong balance sheet. The company has high liquidity and several investment options ahead. This means it could spend more on research or make some strategic investments this year. The company has a dividend yield of 5.77% and has consistently paid shareholders each quarter. A dividend yield above 5% is attractive, and with 3M, there is a certainty that the company will not stop or reduce the dividend payouts.Story continuesLockheed Martin (LMT) LMT Stock Is a Case Study for Buying on the DipSource: ShutterstockAnother dividend stock to own is Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT).

The company manufactures fighter jets which are vital weapons during wars, and while the demand for its products cannot be predicted, it is something that a country will always require. It is also a huge player in the aerospace industry and has a solid satellite business. LMT stock is up 16% over the past six months, trading at $477 today. It is consistently setting new all-time highs. LMT is one of the top dividend stocks that pay quarterly.The company has been recently awarded $106.95 million Navy contract modification for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program. It is a modification to a previously rewarded contract, and despite a decrease in defense spending in this budget, this is one stock that could pay off in the long term.If you are here to generate a handsome passive income through stock investment, LMT stock is worth considering. It recently declared a dividend of $3. Another reason to bet on the stock is that it is a robotics company, and robots today are used in military operations. The company is leading the race and has already developed a robotic mule for $500,000, which carries the equipment for a soldier while they are on missions. The use of robots in the military is still early, but there is massive potential. This is where Lockheed Martin could enjoy an early-mover advantage.LMT stock is a blue-chip stock worth considering, and it might have a dividend yield of only 2.5%, but the annual dividend payout is a whopping $12 per share.Devon Energy (DVN)An image of a hand holding a smartphone displaying the Devon Energy Corporation logo in front of a computer screenSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comEnergy companies are here for the long term, and one such player is Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). The company is engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and is one of the top dividend stocks to own. It has a dividend yield of 8.73% which is much better than several blue-chip companies today.DVN stock is trading at $50 today, down 27% in the past six months. With a rise in crude oil prices, the company saw massive growth and reported a free cash flow of $2.1 billion. Through this, it managed to reduce the outstanding shares by 4%. The stock dropped after the company showed lower production and higher capital expenditure targets for this year. This drop gives a better entry point for investors looking to add the dividend stock to their portfolio. It announced a dividend increase of 11% in 2023 which came in at $5.17 for the year, and it announced a dividend of $0.89 for this quarter. The company has not indicated that its dividend is in danger. Looking at the balance sheet, we can see that the firm has enough resources to keep rewarding the shareholders.The stock has been steady, and it rarely falls. After the massive drop in 2022, the stock did snap back and rewarded patient investors. DVN stock is also one of the best oil and gas stocks to own in 2023.On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Vandita Jadeja is a CPA and a freelance financial copywriter who loves to read and write about stocks.

The company's success over the long term is going to come from the next generation of people” Goldberg says. “So it behooves executives to help them grow, help them learn and show them the ropes.“It’s a two-way street,” he concludes.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ]"

(NYSE:YUM) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 80%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-inc-nyse-yum-130027842.html,1679144427,STORY,['YUM'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Yum! Brands implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 16 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 80% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Yum! Brands. See our latest analysis for Yum! Brands ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Yum! Brands?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Yum! Brands. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Yum! Brands' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Yum! Brands. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 9.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.5% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Yum! BrandsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Yum! Brands, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$41m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Yum! Brands. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks for example - Yum! Brands has   4 warning signs  (and 2 which are significant)  we think you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

BrandsYum! Brands, Friday, March 17, 2023, Press release pictureTaco Bell BlogAt Taco Bell, we empower our teams to be fearless, embrace difference and drive change. We believe that each one of us has a story to tell.This year's nationwide Women's History Month's focus is Celebrating Women Who Tell Our Stories, which you can learn more about on nationalwomenshistoryalliance.org.To honor and celebrate this year's focus and women at The Bell, we will continue to tell their stories and amplify their voices. We will share their stories every week in the month of March in hopes that they not only educate but inspire you to drive positive and intentional impact within your community.But first, a little Women's History Month background... March is dedicated as Women's History Month in the U.S., United Kingdom, and Australia. In 1982, Women's History Week was officially launched in the United States. Five years later, the entire month of March was devoted to acknowledging courageous trailblazers across all backgrounds - creating room to celebrate the cultural impact of past, current, and future generations.Throughout the year, we will continue sharing the incredible stories of our Taco Bell teams; the sharing and celebration doesn't stop here.Jasmine B. - Live Más ScholarEven at young age, Jasmine knew she wanted to be a journalist and did everything she could to gain experience, including editing videos and photos. When she was a senior in high school, she was a news anchor on the student newscast, and even co-directed a documentary named A Woofing Inspiration, which won third place in the Virginia High School League Competition. She used her video skills to create a Live Más Scholarship submission and her hard work was rewarded - she received a $25,000 Live Más Scholarship from the Taco Bell Foundation to pursue her college education. The Taco Bell team, the school staff and her mother were all there to give her the news, which gave her a sense of pride and even more confidence to take the next step in her education journey.Story continuesIn high school, she wanted to attend a four-year university with a major in Mass Communication and Minor in Creative writing. At the time, she was stressing about her financial situation and how she could afford college, especially her dream school... Hampton University. This scholarship helped make all those dreams come true, ""I feel very lucky to be working at this restaurant [Taco Bell] that has provided me with these types of opportunities. I do not know where I would be if I had not applied to Taco Bell in my junior year of high school. I know that other companies provide opportunities to their teams, but I feel like Taco Bell has a family environment that I could never get anywhere else. I know when I come home for a break from school, I have a second home where I can come and feel a sense of nostalgia from a place that has given me a chance to follow my dreams.""But Jasmine is not only a student - she's a big sister, was co-captain of her dance team, and a seasonal Taco Bell restaurant team member at franchise organization BurgerBusters, Inc. And now, she attends Hampton University, is a member of the Freshman Executive Council, a member of Hampton University Chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists and has her very own YouTube channel. All in all, there is never a dull moment in her life.But she couldn't do it without the support and love of her family, especially her mother and grandmother. The women in her family taught her determination and strength.""As a woman, I'm proud to have a month [like Women's History Month] that celebrates me being a woman and all the accomplishments women have made in the world. But it means more to me as an African American woman. It's double the impact for me because I can appreciate all the achievements these women have made that enhanced the world in a positive way.""She uses that knowledge every time she steps out of her comfort zone and tries new things, and she knows that her mother will always be there to support her on her new adventures. She thanks her mother, grandmother and all the women before her for the way they have nurtured her to become a leader and role model.""As an aspiring leader, I know it can be difficult to lead others when you aren't 100% sure what you want to do. To be a good leader, you must also know how to follow. This means you must be comfortable in your confidence in order to learn how to be a better leader.""With this new chapter ahead at Hampton University, she's ready to take on her dream of becoming a broadcast journalist. As a future woman in journalism, Jasmine hopes that she will become a role model for little girls, especially her two little sisters. With all she has accomplished thus far, there is no doubt that she will make a true impact in the world.""I'm excited for the future and what the world will challenge me with. My hard work and determination to be successful will help me achieve any new goals I make. The future is unknown to everyone and that's exciting because you never know where you will end up so it's essential to live life to the fullest.""Her favorite color is blue. She's a Libra. She loves Nacho Fries. She's a powerhouse. She's Jasmine; she's a Live Más Scholar and future broadcast journalist.

This will be the highest spending on record, up $1 billion from the last year. St. Patrick's Day has also become the largest beer-drinking holiday in the United States, with Irish beers like Guinness and Smithwick’s being the most popular brands.That being said, let’s raise a toast to the stocks from the sectors most likely to benefit from the day and try to find some hidden luck on this Irish festival. These include Diageo plc DEO, Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, BJ's Restaurants BJRI, McDonald's Corporation MCD, and Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. SFM.About 61% of Americans are expected to celebrate the festival this year, with average spending of $43.84. This is up from the last year record of 54% of Americans spending. Men tend to spend more than women, shelling out an average of $48.71 versus $39.15 for women.Special AttractionsAbout 72% of the people celebrating the day are between the age group of 18 to 34 years, followed by 38% in the age group of 35-54 years and 45% for 55 years plus age. Americans plan to celebrate the holiday in a number of ways, with 80% wearing green, 31% planning a special dinner, 15% attending private parties, and 25% attending a party at a bar or a restaurant. Additionally, 15% plan to attend a St. Patrick’s Day parade.Further, about 48% of Americans, including children will be spending on holiday-themed food, 43% on beverages, 36% on apparels, 35% on decoration, 25% on candy, 10% on greeting cards and 9% on gifts.According to the Numerator data, more than one-third of the people celebrating St. Patrick’s Day expect to raise a glass this year. Of the total, 36% plan to purchase alcoholic beverages for the holiday, with beer being the most popular choice (70% of those planning to buy alcohol), followed by spirits (34%) and wine (29%). For those choosing beer, 50% plan to drink American lagers (Budweiser, Coors Original, Miller High Life), 31% are likely to opt for stouts (Guinness, Imperial), and the rest will choose international lagers like Corona Extra, Heineken and Red Stripe.Thus, this festival, also called St. Paddy’s Day, leads to pots of gold for bars and restaurants. Many restaurants are offering specials and turning treats green, from Krispy Kreme doughnuts to McDonald's Shamrock Shake and Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.In the United States, St. Patrick's Day is associated with the consumption of corned beef though it is not an Irish national dish. Corned beef is used as a substitute for bacon by Irish-American immigrants and many companies produce this product in various forms.Story continuesStocks to Raise a Toast toDiageo produces, markets, and sells alcoholic beverages.

A brewing banking crisis is adding fuel to the already weak economy mired by stubborn inflation and Fed's hawkish stance. Many economists project that the United States could slip into recession sooner than expected.With consumers rather downbeat about economic outlook, they are less likely to spend heavily on high-ticket items, which may hurt vehicle sales. Additionally, high commodity and labor costs are adversely impacting the margins of the industry participants. While robust deliveries of electric vehicles (EV) are acting as a booster, the overall prospects of the industry don't appear bright, at least for the near term.Nonetheless, we recommend keeping a close eye on three auto giants namely General Motors, PACCAR and Harley-Davidson, which are better positioned to brave the multiple industry challenges.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Industry?Intensified Economic Uncertainty: At a time when the U.S. economy is already mired in uncertainty amid Fed's aggressive rate hikes, the sudden collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank has just added to the gloom. The banking crisis has prompted Goldman Sachs to ratchet down U.S. GDP forecasts. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs lowered its U.S. growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 1.2% for 2023. The investment banking giant also raised the probability of a U.S. recession from 25% to 35%.The highly cyclical Domestic Auto industry is likely to feel the heat of a fragile economy. Demand for vehicles is expected to cool off as consumers are gradually becoming apprehensive about buying high-ticket items when recessionary fears are growing. While auto sales in 2022 fell to a decade low, primarily owing to supply chain issues, this year, the industry is likely to suffer from macroeconomic challenges. The supply crunch is most likely to morph into a demand slowdown in 2023.High Commodity &amp; Operational Costs: Prices of raw materials like steel, aluminum and others are soaring and adversely impacting the gross margins. Commodity inflation, although gradually abating, is far from over. Most automakers have already warned that high raw materials and labor costs will remain a major headwind for quite some time. Manufacturing inefficiencies and logistic challenges are expected to keep playing spoilsports. Additionally, massive R&amp;D expenses for the development of high-tech cars would also likely strain near-term cash flows.Soaring EV Popularity: Amid all the gloom and doom, buyers' inclination toward green cars is a silver lining. Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles' adoption by both automakers as well as customers. Legacy automakers are going the extra mile to gain a strong foothold in this red-hot e-mobility space. Demand for electric cars is off the charts. While sales of passenger vehicles declined last year, EV sales in the country shot up 65%. In fact, sales of EVs topped 5% of U.S. new vehicle sales for the first time in 2022. The EV momentum is likely to offer some respite.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 20-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it in the bottom 33% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have declined 20.5% over the past three months.Despite the industry's tepid near-term prospects, we will present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio. Before that, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 40.8% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector's decline of 11.5% and 34%, respectively, over the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 11.27X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 11.87X and the sector's 12.21X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 53.78X, as low as 8.44X and at a median of 15.05X.3 Stocks Worth Holding OntoGeneral Motors: This legacy U.S. automaker's hot-selling brands in America, like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra, are driving its top line. General Motors' massive EV push is commendable. The automaker plans to roll out 30 fresh EV models by 2025-end. This year, it will have nine EV models in the North America market. Solid demand for GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV, Cadillac crossover EV, Equinox EV, Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Blazer EV and BrightDrop Zevo 600 are expected to buoy top-line growth.General Motors has enough cash on the balance sheet to weather short-term headwinds and navigate economic cycles. The firm had total automotive liquidity of $39.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2022, including $24.4 billion of cash/cash equivalents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GM's 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 3.2%. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 10 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 13 cents over the past 30 days. General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PACCAR: PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising XF, XG and XD models, augurs well. New launches have improved the company's product mix. PACCAR's accelerated efforts toward electrification and connected vehicle services are praiseworthy.Continued growth in the aftermarket parts—which is a high margin and a less cyclic business— thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine bodes well.High truck utilization and increased average fleet age are positively impacting PACCAR Parts results. The company's strong balance sheet is complemented by A+/A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR's 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 13% and 6.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 13 cents over the past 30 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has increased by a cent over the past 30 days. PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of A.Harley-Davidson: This iconic motorcycle maker in the United States is reaping the benefits of its Hardwire strategic plan.The Hardwire strategy aims at long-term profitability and growth through refreshed product offerings. In sync with its long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, Harley-Davidson will be focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends.As an integral part of its Hardwire strategy, Harley-Davidson launched an online platform for its used motorcycles, namely HD-1, last year. The H-D1 marketplace platform is also set to fuel the company's prospects. The LiveWire unit—dedicated to e-bikes— will particularly help the company gain a solid foothold in a sportier market environment with its innovative and differentiated offerings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG's 2023 and 2024 sales implies year-over-year growth of 4% and 7%, respectively. The consensus mark for 2023 earnings has moved north by 4 cents over the past seven days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has risen by 5 cents over the past seven days. Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has a VGM Score of A.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

224,6795f5be-6e04-3051-ab0b-8a48e2e3474b,UPS,2023-03-18,United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) three-year earnings growth trails the 30% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-services-nyse-ups-140020296.html,1679061620,STORY,['UPS'],"[It might seem bad, but the worst that can happen when you buy a stock (without leverage) is that its share price goes to zero. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) share price has soared 101% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. In the last week the share price is up 3.5%.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, United Parcel Service achieved compound earnings per share growth of 38% per year. The average annual share price increase of 26% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how United Parcel Service has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling United Parcel Service stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of United Parcel Service, it has a TSR of 119% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveUnited Parcel Service shareholders are down 12% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -12%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 17%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   3 warning signs  we've spotted with United Parcel Service (including 1 which is concerning) .Of course United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy.

(AMEX:ZOM) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 15, 2023Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Zomedica's Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and all participants are in a listen-only mode. The call will be open for questions and answers following the presentation. On today's call is Zomedica's CEO, Larry Heaton; and CFO, Ann Cotter. Before we begin, the company would like to remind everyone that various remarks about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Zomedica cautions that these are forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause their actual results to differ materially from those indicated including risks described in the company's filings with the SEC.Any forward-looking statements made on this conference call speak only as of today's date, Wednesday, March 15, 2023. And the company does not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today. I will now pass the call over to Zomedica's Chief Executive Officer, Larry Heaton. Please go ahead.Larry Heaton: Thank you. I'd like to start by thanking our shareholders for their support, and wishing our prospective investors and analysts and others a good afternoon, and welcome you to the Zomedica fiscal year 2022 earnings release call. On this call, I'll be providing an update on the business, followed by Ann Cotter, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results. After our prepared remarks, we'll open the line to your questions. In a bit, Zomedica will be releasing its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022. As we reflect on these results, we're very pleased with the progress the team has made on multiple fronts as we continue our transformation into a market leader in point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic products for companion animals.Story continuesAt Zomedica, we're bringing products to veterinarians to help them do the things they really love to do, improve the quality of care for the pets and the satisfaction of the pet parents, and to help them do the things that they really need to do, improve workflow, cash flow and profitability. 2022 was another transformational year for Zomedica through acquisitions of products that meet the standard, along with significant improvements in infrastructure, manufacturing capacity and commercial capabilities. In 2022, we significantly expanded our product portfolio to include five high-value technology platforms, expanded our sales and marketing organization and capabilities, built a comprehensive internal support infrastructure, grew our revenues from zero in 2020 to $4 million in 2021 to almost $19 million in 2022, and established a pipeline of several new product launches for 2023.We were pleased with our progress with our TRUFORMA platform during the year. This platform is a great example of the razor and blade model and that we provide the instruments at no cost to the customer in return for a lifetime and enduring revenue stream from high-value diagnostic tests. To build the value of this platform, we expand the installed base of instruments and expand the menu by introducing new assays. During the year, we launched two new TRUFORMA assays for ACTH and Free T4, both providing the only assay of their type available at the point-of-care. In January of this year, we entered new license agreements with our TRUFORMA development partner, giving us the opportunity to develop and manufacture assays and instruments ourselves.We are planning to continue our investment in the development of additional assays, which we believe will increase the utility of the TRUFORMA for our customers over time and generate higher revenue per installed instrument. For 2023, these include planned assays for non-infectious gastrointestinal disease and our first assays for horses both of which we expect to launch this year. Our PulseVet platform continues to perform strongly. While historically used in the treatment of horses, the recent introduction of the X-Trode hand piece, which enables use with small animals without sedation, is now being marketed to small animal veterinarians. Over the last decade, aquiline patients have benefited significantly from this clinically proven non-invasive therapy.Now small animals could be readily treated with Shock Wave Therapy for over 20 clinical applications, backed by peer-reviewed clinical literature and providing alternatives to costly medication therapy that carries potentially harmful side effects or expensive surgeries. We've been pleased with the uptake of this technology, which is covered by most pet insurance policies by small animal veterinarians and pet parents alike. In fact, small animal device sales grew 405% in 2022 from 21 devices in 2021 to 106 devices in 2022. We believe PulseVet set sales will remain strong into 2023, especially given the efforts around development of the small animal market. Our Assisi LOOP of products, which joined Zomedica's portfolio of offerings in the third quarter proved to be a solid contributor to our 2022 results with roughly $2.1 million in sales for the year.Like our PulseVet products, the Assisi LOOP products, which generate targeted pulsed electromagnetic wave therapy to reduce inflammation and pain, they provided non-invasive and non-pharmacological approach to pain relief for pets. Also like PulseVet, our Assisi products showed year-over-year growth, both as part of Zomedica as well as when they were a standalone company. The difference between the two is that the Assisi products are positioned to be used at home by pet parents, including them in the treatment pathway for their pets. So the vet can treat the patient in the clinic with PulseVet Shock Wave therapy and then send the healing home with the Assisi LOOP products. As we leverage our communication and marketing networks, we expect Assisi recognition and brand awareness to increase resulting in expected growth in 2023.Although not part of our 2022 results, we do expect additional growth in revenue in 2023 from sales of the VetGuardian zero-touch wireless vital science monitoring system, which launched in early January, as well as our new TRUVIEW digital microscopy platform, featuring the first automatic slide preparation system available anywhere to improve both workflow and image quality, which is expected to launch in the second quarter. Overall, we're pleased with our progress in 2022 and excited to continue building on this traction and growth trajectory. In addition to putting in place measures to grow our top line results, we have also put forth considerable focus and effort into developing and enhancing our internal processes, including hiring additional people, with significant increases in R&amp;D, business development and sales and marketing.Included in these hires are industry experts, scientists, veterinarians and other personnel with extensive experience and knowledge in the companion animal field and investing over $1 million to develop our manufacturing capability and capacity through our new global manufacturing and distribution center in Roswell, Georgia. This facility, which we moved into in August of 2022, expands our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, enabling us to meet growing commercial global demand and support future growth and new product offerings. With a healthy cash position and projected sales growth at 2023, we feel we are setting ourselves on a strategic pathway to create and enhance shareholder value. We're pleased with our progress along the pathway to cash flow breakeven and profitability, which we consider to be significant milestones for growth and shareholder value.We believe these require a combination of substantial growing revenue and efficient manufacturing producing substantial margins, while at the same time, investing in operating expense to enable both growth from organic sources and drove by acquisition. We have invested in an experienced leadership and growing commercial team and a robust marketing capability, along with expanding our manufacturing capacity. Now, we have the opportunity to leverage these investments by launching and growing new products and acquiring new ones as well, to generate increased revenue to move us further on the path to profitability. In closing, we are optimistic about Zomedica's future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Anne to take us through Zomedica's 2022 fiscal performance and provide additional thoughts on what to expect in fiscal 2023.Ann Cotter: Thank you, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. During this portion of the call, I will be focusing on selected aspects of our income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet. While I will be providing brief explanations on various drivers, much of this information is covered and broader depth within our recently filed 10-K. I encourage you to review this document for additional detail and commentary. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was a very healthy $6.2 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 51% from the fourth quarter of 2021. The primarily driven by an increase in PulseVet sales and the inclusion of our recently acquired Assisi products, we saw an upward trend of increasing revenue in 2022, going from $3.7 million in sales in Q1, $4.2 million in sales in Q2, $4.8 million in sales in Q3, and $6.2 million in sales in Q4.Revenue for the year ended 2022 was $18.9 million, an increase of $14.8 million or 361% from the year ended 2021. Again, primarily driven by a full year's worth of PulseVet sales and the inclusion of the recently acquired Assisi products. When considering stand-alone sales or sales exit we had owned Assisi and PulseVet from January 1, 2021, our sales were up 25%. Given the continued uptick in sales of our current offerings, that is TRUFORMA, PulseVet and Assisi as well as our expected launch of VetGuardian and Revo related products. We expect revenue to continue to grow in 2023. Gross profit margin for the year ended 2022 was $13.7 million or 72% compared to $3.1 million or 74% for the year ended 2021, an increase of $10.6 million. Although, our margins continue to be extremely healthy, the drop in margin compared to 2021 relates to a changing mix of product sales, including Assisi, TRUFORMA and PulseVet small animal devices and trod.In general, we believe gross margins will remain relatively unchanged in percentage terms due to a variety of factors. Research and development expense for the year ended 2022 was $2.6 million, an increase of $0.9 million or 53% from the year ended 2021, primarily driven by an increase in contracted expenses for research fees and trials, as we continue to develop and test our next-generation TRUFORMA assays. Our new license agreements with our TRUFORMA development partner gives us the ability to expand our assay development program, which may result in increased total expenditures in the short term, although with a lower cost of development on a per-assay basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended 2022 were $33 million, an increase of $10.2 million or 45% from the year ended 2021, primarily driven by salaries and noncash stock compensation expense associated with increased hiring campaign, the inclusion of PulseVet, Revo Squared and Assisi headcount, acquisition-related intangible amortization, increase in office expenses, travel and trade show attendance associated with lifting COVID restrictions and the marketing of our new TRUFORMA assays and our new product lines.Our net loss for the year ended 2022 was $17 million, a decrease of $1.4 million or 8% from the year ended 2021. The net loss in each period was attributed to the matters described earlier. We expect to continue to record net losses in the future periods until time -- until such time as we have sufficient revenue from product sales to offset our operating expenses. Zomedica had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities of approximately $156 million, as of the year ended 2022, a decrease of $39 million or 20% from the year ended 2021, primarily driven by cash used in operating and investing activities, as I will discuss. Net cash and operating activities for the year ended 2022 was $11.7 million. The reduction -- the reduction in operating expense is a result of the increased revenue we recognized and a reduction of overall operating expenses compared to the prior year.Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2022 was $155.9 million, an increase of $84 million or 117% from the prior year 2021, primarily driven by significant investments in available-for-sale securities, our acquisitions of Assisi, Revo Squared, and other leasehold improvements and expenditures to improve our e-commerce internal sales and accounting programs. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended 2022 was zero. This is a 100% decrease from 2021 of $219.2 million, as we did not complete a public offering of our shares in 2022. Our balance sheet continued to show strong ratios in 2022. Our working capital is strong at $115.7 million. Our current and quick ratios are strong at approximately 16% showing a high amount of liquidity, our debt-to-asset ratio is approximately 4%, showing a high level of solvency.Assets remained flat at $280 million as cash used for Revo and Assisi purchases were offset by related increases in goodwill and intangibles, as well as cash used to purchase PP&amp;E associated with our manufacturing center upgrade. Liabilities increased primarily due to the earnout liability recorded from the acquisition of Revo and larger accruals in AP for inventory and other operating expenses, all of which are growth oriented. Due to our projected increase in sales and decrease in operating cash needs and a very strong balance sheet, we believe Zomedica has a strong future, and we are optimistic about the future of the company. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Larry.Most Affordable Veterinary Schools in the USLucky Business/Shutterstock.comLarry Heaton: Thank you, Ann. And before we move to Q&amp;A, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you, Ann, not only for this report, but for your many years of tireless service to Zomedica. Ann has decided to retire from Zomedica and we have worked out a transition plan, whereby she will continue with the company for the next 30 days to ensure a smooth transition to a new CFO and is planning on continuing to consult with Zomedica afterwards. We'll provide more information on the timing and transition over the next few days. But for now, on behalf of myself, our colleagues and the Board of Directors, I'd like to extend our deepest gratitude to Ann for her considerable contributions to Zomedica over the years, and thanks in advance for her assistance going forward.Ann Cotter: Thank you.Larry Heaton: And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&amp;A.Operator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. There are no audio questions at this time.Larry Heaton: Okay. So can you turn this over to our IR team now, so that we could get questions off the web?Paul Kuntz: Yes. This is Paul Kuntz with the IR team. We have a lot of questions on the webcast of 400-some people on here, so we'll just jump into some of these right now. Larry, one of our first questions was, does the recent bank crisis have any impact on Zomedica?Larry Heaton: In a word, no. We have had no cash on deposit with either Silicon Valley Bank or with Signature Bank. And we also have pulled our major vendors to see whether they have any exposure and the answer has been no. And this is, of course, notwithstanding the fact that the government has also stepped in to address the issue. But we have -- we see no impact on Zomedica from it.Paul Kuntz: Thank you, Larry. And we've had quite a few questions on this subject. Can you talk a little bit about when the company -- the path to profitability, when the company will become profitable?Larry Heaton: Sure. So, we're really striving to reach two important milestones: cash flow breakeven and profitability. And to get an idea of what it takes to get the cash flow positive, let's dig into a couple of metrics. In 2022, per GAAP, we lost around $17 million, with operating expenses of $36 million. But of the OpEx, $12 million was booked for non-cash expenses, depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock comp for the many employees that we've hired over the last 18 months. So to get to cash flow breakeven, if everything else was equal year-over-year, we would need to generate an additional $5 million in cash. At 70% gross margins, that's another $8 million in sales or about 42% up from 2022. Of course, sales above that or reduced expenses would push us past cash flow positive and further on the path to profitability.Now D&amp;A and non-cash stock comp decrease over time. But if they didn't, then we would need to generate an additional $17 million in sales to get to profitability, which explains why we are heavily focused on investing in revenue growth, both organic and through M&amp;A. So given our cash position and track record of acquiring, integrating and growing products through M&amp;A, you can be sure that we're focused in this area so that we can accelerate reaching profitability. So, near-term goal is cash flow breakeven and cash flow positive, and then a little beyond that, trailing that will be our quest for profitability.Paul Kuntz: Thank you, Larry. And our next question, with the recent uptake of AI in the world, is there anything in the works to maybe acquire AI products or partner up with an AI company to take advantage of technology in the pet industry?Larry Heaton: I'm going to ask Greg Blair, our Vice President of Business Development, who's working in this area to comment.Greg Blair: Thank you, Larry. AI is definitely gaining awareness and prominence across industries and the animal health industry is no exception. Through our My Zomedica platform, we do indeed collects data of varying types for most of our product lines. As we launch new product lines, including the TRUVIEW platform, we do see a role for AI going forward with our product lines. And we would anticipate that, that will play a part in managing the data that we're collecting and improving the diagnostic capability of the products that we offer to our customers.Paul Kuntz: Thank you. And our next question is stock manipulation and naked short selling something you would consider addressing at all? And -- or would you solely focus on the growth prospects of the company and believe the stock price will eventually follow.Larry Heaton: Right. So the easy answer to that is that we're focused on building the value for our shareholders by building the value of the company, by generating revenue at high margins and ultimately getting to cash flow positive and profitability. A little more complex is the fact that, we've seen other companies fall victim to short selling. And we've seen other companies take action in this regard by engaging law firms and so on and so forth. As we look at it, we note that our stock price is relatively low at, I think, around $0.25 today. I haven't checked it in the last hour or so, but $0.24, $0.25 and our market cap then is around $250 million, and we have $156 million in cash, and we've had significantly rising revenues at high margins.So it just doesn't make a lot of sense to us that people would regard us as a significant target for short selling, because they're upside is significantly limited while their downside is, I mean, it's my boggling what could happen. And in fact, anyone that's followed the stock over the last few years saw it really take a flyer a couple of years ago. So, my goodness, if you were shorted at that point, you would have not been really pleased. So I guess what I'm saying is that we continue to keep a look, keep a watch on it. We think that we're probably more susceptible to swing traders, people that see that, for whatever reason, and I think it's largely a result of the lack of institutional ownership of the stock, they see that it kind of travels pretty freely between around 23, 24 and 27 and trade those swings, which ends all legitimate and anyone that's buying our stock, we're a fan.On the other hand, we would encourage people to consider holding it for the long-term, because we think for the mid to long-term we have a great opportunity to increase shareholder value as reflected in share price.Paul Kuntz: Very good. Thank you, Larry. And our next question, how much is your customer acquisition cost? And do you see this number becoming lower in the future?Larry Heaton: So, easy to answer the second part. The first part is a little more difficult. As you know, we currently are commercializing three product lines. Actually, it's 2023. We're now selling four different products. We have another one that we're launching next quarter. So there's not an easy answer to customer acquisition costs on the whole. For example, our PulseVet products are sold primarily by direct sales representatives, while our Assisi products are sold through distribution and online. So it varies by product line. What I would say, however, is that the second part of the question is, I see it going down for sure. In fact, that's been our strategy, right? When 18 months ago, we had only the single product and revenues were nominal, and we began to build the infrastructure and the sales and marketing engine that would expand to really any channel through which an animal health customer would like to acquire their products.And we did that in anticipation of first growing revenues with the products that we had, but also being able to plug additional products into those sales channels without any additional expense associated with them. And so hard to answer the first question with any sort of a broad answer that is going to vary significantly between the products, but easy to answer that we expect considerable operating leverage from our commercial organization as we add new products.Paul Kuntz: Thank you, Larry. And our next question, can you talk a little bit about the outlook for the coming year?Larry Heaton: Sure. We -- I think as we have spoken in our prepared remarks, we expect continued growth, for sure, both from the organic growth of PulseVet, Assisi and TRUFORMA products, but also the introduction in January of the VetGuardian and next quarter of the TRUVIEW. Having said that, though, I do want to say that we do expect sales to be sequentially down in the first quarter of this year, due to the seasonality of PulseVet capital purchases, which are always highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the following or first quarter, due to year-end tax rates for purchasing capital. We're not providing revenue guidance for the full year as we prefer to wait to do that until after we've gained some experience with our newest products, the VetGuardian system, which was launched in January, which we're pleased with, and the TRUVIEW digital microscopy platform, which we expect to launch next quarter.So we expect to see growth in the year, driven by organic growth as well as the new products. Obviously, we also will continue a robust M&amp;A set of activities, but obviously can't forecast that just now. So we should expect revenue down sequentially in Q1 and then up at each of the subsequent quarters.Paul Kuntz: Great. Thank you, Larry. And our next question, when will we do an official launch of the Revo Squared products, including the MicroView and there's a second part, any prospect of releasing the cancer assay in late 2023?Larry Heaton: Okay. So two very different questions there, so let's start with the Revo Squared. So, Revo Squared brought to us two products, the MicroView, which is what the product was called when we acquired it, which we've now transformed into the TRUVIEW System and we expect to launch that next quarter. In fact, we're beginning to build those systems now in our facility in Georgia. So we expect to launch that next quarter. We also, while we haven't made a big to do of it. We continue to sell the Revo Ultrasound System, which they call SonoView. It's not one of our major products. There are plenty of competitors out in the animal health space. The thing that differentiates the SonoView is the fact that our staff can guide individual users in the vet clinic, as they perform Ultrasound, they can train them, they can coach them, they can proctor those Ultrasound procedures.So we have sold some systems. And as we look forward, we expect that we may expand that, but for now, we're just sort of doing business as usual in Revo. On the other hand, the microscope, the TRUVIEW is something that we're really looking forward to launching next quarter. The second part of that question was to do with the cancer test. So as you may, if you followed Zomedica for a while, you may know that, years ago they had a program, a partnership with a company called Celsee to develop a test for detection of cancer in dogs. Celsee was sold to a company called Bio-Rad and Bio-Rad has focused on other projects. They haven't -- they do not have an active program now in this Cancer Detection area. We note that we received issuance of a patent in 2022 that relates to the technology.But as of now, we do not have an active program underway to develop that product. And we would need a new partner if we decided to do that. We also note that there are a couple of other companies that are out in the market now, which wasn't the case several years ago, that are already providing this product into the marketplace. So we have no immediate plans. And please don't read into that that we, -- well, it's not immediate, but it's downstream. We don't have any plans at this point.Paul Kuntz: Great. Thank you, Larry. And actually the next two are related in this case. One of the questions is, it has been previously mentioned, considering a reverse split when markets and core business momentum is in the company's favor. Is that still the plan, or would share buybacks also be in consideration with increasing revenue and condition of the business. And a related question is, is there a chance that the company could be de-listed as it's been under $1 more than a year?Larry Heaton: All right. So I'll take the last part of that first, because it's pretty easy. There are some exchanges that require the stock price to be at $1 for or not below $1 for a certain period of time. That does not apply to the New York Stock Exchange -- American Exchange, which is where we're listed. There -- they -- their expectation is that your stock will remain above $0.20 per share and not go below $0.20 per share for some period of time. So, we're currently trading above $0.20 a share. We did dip below that toward the end of last year into the first few days of this year. On the other hand, we did not receive any official notice of delisting or whatnot. So, it's all up to the market. That's who prices our shares.But as long as we stay above $0.20, we'll be good. And it's good that that's the case because many times companies that are struggling with one or other aspect of their activities finds themselves in a position where they're trying to do a reverse stock split really from a position of weakness. They need to do it to get the stock price above, but the reverse stock split in and of itself doesn't make a company that's been struggling all of a sudden not struggling. And so off times, those reverse stock splits are not -- they don't have great outcomes. In our case, we do believe that at some point, a stock -- a reverse stock split would make sense, not because we're in a position of weakness or we're struggling, but rather because it would enable us to fairly quickly enable certain institutional investors that may otherwise have an interest in acquiring Zomedica stock, but can't do it because our stock is not above the threshold that their charters require of $1 in some cases $2, in some cases, heck, I've heard of some of that you can't invest in the stock that's less than $5.So, for us, we think that it would be desirable to have institutions be able to acquire stock in Zomedica, not at the expense of retail investors, not at the expense of our many shareholders, but rather as a complement because these institutions typically take a large positions and longer view. They hold it for a little bit longer, normally. And we think that that sort of foundation, not only will that reduce the actively traded float, but it may also dissuade short sellers or swing traders from viewing Zomedica as an attractive target. So, what I have said before and what I'll say now is that I think that in the future, a reverse stock split would make sense for us, but it's not something that we would do until we believe that our shareholders and other potential investors would view us as doing it from a position of strength.In other words, we get cash flow positive. We get much closer to or realize profitability. And at that point, I think people would understand we're not -- this isn't the beginning of a downward cycle, but rather the beginning of an upward movement. With respect to a stock buyback, we continue to believe that the best use of our available capital is to fund organic growth and enable additional M&amp;A activity. So, we have no near-term plans for a stock buyback.Paul Kuntz: Thank you, Larry. And I'm going to pass the call now back to the operator for -- we have a few callers in the queue. And for the rest of our webcast participants that have entered questions, we will request a follow-up with everyone in the next 24 to 48 hours. But for now, we're going to go back to the phone queue.

The collapse of SVB rattled investors’ confidence, as they started pulling their assets and deposits out of the bank soon after the crisis. According to a report by Bloomberg, top executives at 15 banks lost $267 million in wealth in the span of days following the collapse. The rippling effects of this fallout were felt in Europe as well.As investors registered their fears regarding the fallout, President Biden assured the nation of the banking system’s safety. He announced that investors will have access to their deposits whenever they need. In a joint statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg also attempted to boost investor confidence by offering loans to banks for up to one year. Here are some comments from the Fed:“This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.”Despite government intervention, bank stocks continue to fall in value. The S&amp;P Banks Select Industry Index declined by 12.88% in the past five days, compared with a 2.28% return of the S&amp;P 500.Considering this slump in the banking sector, wealth advisors recommend putting money across different asset classes. Patrick Dwyer, managing director at NewEdge Wealth, spoke to CNBC about possible investment strategies to follow. He asserted that investors should put money into Treasuries and money markets as they can offer around 5% risk-free return during elevated interest rate periods. Similarly, Michael Zeuner, managing partner at WE Family Offices, also highlighted the importance of cash in this environment. He mentioned:Story continues“For so many years, cash was just not an interesting investment. It was paying zero, so people weren’t really paying attention to cash. Over the last year, as rates came up, and as the fear of a recession kicked in, a lot of families started to take some risk off the table. It went into cash. And so cash, from an investment perspective, [has] all of a sudden become a much more important part of the portfolio.”During such economic environments, the main focus of investors is to generate stable and regular income. Investing in dividend stocks is one of the best ways to achieve this goal as these companies reward investors with monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts.Keeping in mind the current situation of the banking sector, we will discuss the best bank dividend stocks in this article. Some of these companies include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for American Express The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At American ExpressOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, for US$8.6m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$161). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In total, American Express insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).American Express Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of American Express shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$9.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of American ExpressFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. American Express insiders own about US$162m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The American Express Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold American Express shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - American Express has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.But note: American Express may not be the best stock to buy.

Shares have lost about 10.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Martin Marietta due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Martin Marietta Tops on Q4 Earnings, Misses on RevenuesMartin Marietta Materials, Inc.  mixed results for fourth-quarter 2022. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues (products and services) missed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics declined due to inclement weather in a number of key markets and higher operating costs.Pertaining to 2022 results, Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of MLM, stated, “2022 marked our Company’s eleventh consecutive year delivering increased products and services revenues, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as our most profitable year ever. We achieved record financial results and world-class safety incidence rates while also seamlessly integrating a large platform acquisition and completing non-core asset divestitures against a backdrop of rapid monetary tightening, a resulting housing slowdown and cost inflation at 40-year highs.”Nye added, “Entering 2023, near-term product demand visibility is supported by healthy customer backlogs driven by an acceleration in public infrastructure investment and announced large-scale energy and domestic manufacturing projects.”He further stated, “In total, we expect full year 2023 aggregates shipments to be relatively flat but, given the carryover effects of our 2022 commercial actions and broad acceptance of our January 1, 2023 price increases, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver accelerated margin expansion.”Story continuesInside the HeadlinesMartin Marietta reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $3.04 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 by 0.7% but decreased 3.5% from the year-ago quarter’s $3.15 per share.

Products and services revenues of $1.38 billion, contributing 93.4% to total revenues, decreased 1.9% year over year and missed the consensus mark of $1.43 billion. Higher pricing gains and value-enhancing acquisitions were offset by lower shipments due to unfavorable weather.Segmental DiscussionBuilding Materials (including aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt, paving product lines and Freight) reported revenues of $1,406.9 million, which decreased 1.1% year over year. Within the segment, product and service revenues amounted to $1,314.9 million, down from the year-ago quarter’s $1,337.3 million.

Inclement weather in certain key markets led to a decrease in shipments.Cement shipments declined 10.8% year over year due to wet and cold weather in Texas. Pricing increased 20.8% year over year.Within the Downstream business, ready mixed concrete shipments declined 46.4%, with pricing growth of 19.6% from the prior-year quarter.Total Asphalt shipments declined 8.7% but pricing jumped 21.4%.Magnesia Specialties reported product and services of $63.5 million (down 6.1% year over year) and freight revenues of $6.1 million (up from $6 million a year ago) due to lower demand for chemical and lime products.Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit decreased 2% year over year.

230,06a267e2-3ada-3002-9331-9239e0636f60,NTAP,2023-03-18,3 Storage Devices Stocks to Look For Amid Industry Weakness,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-storage-devices-stocks-look-151803985.html,1679066283,STORY,"['PSTG', '^GSPC', 'TDC', 'NTAP']","[Weakening global macroeconomic conditions and rising inflation are affecting the IT spending environment. Lower IT spending coupled with continued cloud cost optimization does not bode well for the Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry participants in the near term. Slowdown in PC shipments and elevated component costs are additional near-term headwinds. However, the industry is likely to benefit from momentum in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), auto, connected devices, virtual reality and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the long run. These factors propel the demand for robust data storage solutions, bolstering the requirement for computer storage products. This favors the prospects of prominent industry players like NetApp NTAP, Pure Storage PSTG and Teradata TDC. Democratization of higher internal memory smartphones, faster Internet speed and 5G is likely to be a tailwind for the industry participants. Rapid deployment of 5G networking is driving the proliferation of IoT, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry houses companies that design, develop, manufacture and market various hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). These drives are utilized in PCs, laptops, mobiles, servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, video game consoles, digital video recorders and other consumer electronic devices. A few industry participants, including Pure Storage, provide software-defined all-flash solutions that are uniquely fast and cloud-capable for customers. Many industry players offer high-performance modular memory subsystems, mount and blade server systems, enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Some industry participants also provide purpose-built servers for storing and accessing data over a shared network or the Internet.4 Trends Shaping the Computer - Storage Industry's FutureNew Normal Trends &amp; Rapid Implementation of 5G Opening New Business Avenues: The adoption of a hybrid work model has triggered demand for data-intensive applications like video conferencing and cloud services. Effective storage is essential for harnessing data and is expected to raise demand for high-storage capable SSDs and internal memory in advanced smartphones. Accelerated deployment of 5G and rebound in the smartphone market will likely propel the industry to newer heights. Extensive implementation of cloud computing solutions, increased Internet usage and rapidly-growing media and regulatory compliance, driven by coronavirus-led work-from-home setup, have led to a data explosion for enterprises.Story continuesInnovation in Cloud Storage Technologies to Drive Adoption: Extensive storage options from collocated hardware (such as hard disks and tape drives) to many cloud storage solutions have put the industry on a growth trajectory. The industry players are well poised for growth on the back of a rapid increase in the amount of data, the complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals. The companies rely on Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) to manage and optimize storage solutions. To streamline data storage, companies are relying on virtualization technologies. As more data is amassed from IoT, companies are turning to edge computing architecture to reduce latency and boost flexibility. Kubernetes storage is becoming increasingly popular as it facilitates greater agility and scalability. This has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is a positive for industry players.Macro Headwinds Likely to Prove a Drag on IT Spending: Per a Gartner report, worldwide IT spending is expected to increase 2.4% in 2023 compared with 2022 levels and reach around $4.5 billion. The research firm’s earlier forecast stood at growth of 5.1%. The geopolitical disruptions, inflationary pressures and protracted supply chain troubles are a major concern. Consumers are deferring spending on the purchase of devices, which is likely to affect the IT spending growth in 2023. However, the report added that despite headwinds, enterprises are increasing spending on digital business initiatives, which bodes well for industry participants.Slowing Momentum in PC Shipments Might Hinder Growth Prospects: Worldwide PC shipments dropped 28.5% to 65.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the data compiled by Gartner. The latest Gartner report depicts the end of the massive spike in PC demand due to the pandemic-led work-from-home and online learning wave. In the fourth quarter, sales were affected by the anticipation of a global recession, inflation and higher interest rates. This has led to careful IT spending by business organizations. A slowing PC market does not augur well for the industry participants.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Computer Storage is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #194, which places it in the bottom 22% of more than 249 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks you may want to consider for your portfolio, considering bright prospects, let us look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices industry lags both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index and the broader sector in the past year.The industry has lost 26.3% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 12.5%. The broader sector has declined 15.6% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E (or Price/Earnings), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer storage devices companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 25.22X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.77X. It is also above the sector’s forward-12-month P/E of 22.38X.In the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 30.63X and as low as 10.28X, with the median being 15.27X, as the charts below indicate.Forward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) RatioForward 12-Month P/E Ratio3 Computer-Storage Devices Stocks to Add to WatchlistNetApp: NetApp’s performance is benefiting continued strength in the Public Cloud segment. The company is well-positioned to gain from data-driven digital and cloud transformations. Frequent product launches and secular trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing bode well.The company is likely to benefit from new product launches like BlueXP. Strategic collaborations with VMware and Amazon Web Services bode well in the long term. However, the weakening IT spending environment, especially cloud cost optimization and the shift from high-performance all-flash arrays to low-cost solutions amid a lower spending environment are likely to remain as headwinds, at least in the near term.NetApp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings for the company has remained unchanged at $5.41 per share in the past 30 days. Its long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 8.8%.Price and Consensus: NTAPPure Storage: Pure Storage’s performance is driven by continued momentum in product and subscription services’ revenues. In the last reported quarter, the quarterly revenues jumped 14% to $810.2 million. Subscription revenues is gaining from robust adoption of Evergreen subscription services. Frequent product launches and increasing customer base are major tailwinds.Also, the share repurchase program is noteworthy. For fiscal 2023, PSTG returned $219 million to shareholders by repurchasing 7.8 million shares. The company authorized an incremental $250 million share-repurchase plan.Going ahead, the slowdown in customers’ purchasing expectations owing to rising concerns about tightening monetary actions by the Federal Reserve System are headwinds.Pure Storage carries a Zacks Rank #3. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings for the company improved 3.1% to $1.32 per share in the past 30 days. Its long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 9.2%.Price and Consensus: PSTGTeradata: Teradata Corporation is a leading provider of hybrid cloud analytics software. It has evolved from an enterprise database company to an enterprise analytics platform provider. The company was spun off from NCR Corporation in August 2007.Teradata’s performance is buoyed by solid growth in public cloud annual recurring revenues. Increasing cloud deals and strong momentum in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East &amp; Africa and the Asia Pacific and Japan regions is driving cloud recurring revenues. Cost improvements in subscription and cloud business remain positive. The company is gaining momentum among customers on the back of its analytics platform Vantage on-prem, which remains a tailwind. However, declining recurring, perpetual and consulting revenues affected the quarterly performance.Teradata carries a Zacks Rank #3.

232,7eee48e6-5bbd-3d21-8633-3a95c49d2b9a,NI,2023-03-18,NiSource (NYSE:NI) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.25,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nisource-nyse-ni-announced-increasing-120851810.html,1679141331,STORY,"['NI', 'NIMC']","[The board of NiSource Inc. (NYSE:NI) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.25 on the 19th of May, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This takes the annual payment to 3.6% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for NiSource NiSource's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Prior to this announcement, NiSource's earnings easily covered the dividend, but free cash flows were negative. Since a dividend means the company is paying out cash to investors, this could prove to be a problem in the future.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 0.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 57%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.92, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $1.00. Its dividends have grown at less than 1% per annum over this time frame. We're glad to see the dividend has risen, but with a limited rate of growth and fluctuations in the payments the total shareholder return may be limited.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. NiSource has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 36% per annum. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Our Thoughts On NiSource's DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think NiSource's payments are rock solid. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 2 warning signs for NiSource (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

But these two financial institutions were relatively small. Moreover, Silvergate got into trouble primarily because it focused on the doomed crypto sector. At the same time, SVB made very poor investment decisions, took on too much debt, and was hurt by the anemic IPO market. Most analysts are saying that the banking sector as a whole does not have similar problems and is, in the words of Wells Fargo, “well-capitalized.” Meanwhile, heading into a pivotal election year, Washington unsurprisingly took major steps on March 12 to prevent a major banking crisis. And, by all accounts, the labor market remains extremely strong. The services sector on which the American economy is based is also still rapidly expanding, despite the Fed’s interest-rate hikes. Given these points, long-term investors should not fear buying the best consumer discretionary stocks.The three consumer discretionary names below are reporting great financial results, have strong, positive catalysts, and are trading at attractive valuations. Most importantly, big investors are pouring a great deal of money into them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceDKSDick’s Sporting Goods$149.36TSCOTractor Supply$229.03ULTAUlta Beauty$521.92Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks: Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.Source: George Sheldon via ShutterstockCapitalizing on America’s increased emphasis on health in general and fitness in particular since the pandemic, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) earlier this month reported exceptionally strong fourth-quarter results, given its status as a very large, well-established retailer.Specifically, the company’s revenue climbed 7.2% year-over-year to a record $3.6 billion, while its comparable store sales jumped 5.3% YOY. Compared with 2019, the retailer’s top line soared by 41%.Story continuesPushed down by inflation and supply-chain issues, Dick’s earnings per share, excluding certain items, did drop 20% to $2.93. But very encouragingly, CEO Lauren Hobart expects the retailer’s “merchandise margin” to climb this year. Moreover, Hobart provided 2023 EPS guidance of $12.90-$13.80. At the midpoint of that range, Dick’s EPS would climb 11% compared with 2022.And in a sign of tremendous confidence in its outlook, Dick’s raised its annual dividend by over 100% to $4 per share.Dick’s forward price-earnings ratio of 12.25 is quite attractive, while the stock’s 11% rally between March 6 and March 10, on very high volume and amid a struggling stock market, indicates that the “big money” has become quite fond of the shares.The retailer’s strong results, high dividend, and the big money’s confidence in it make it one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy now.Tractor Supply (TSCO)The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) storeSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) sells various products, including food for livestock and pets, to consumers. Ironside Research, a Seeking Alpha contributor, describes TSCO’s core customers as “the affluent rural.”With most American farmers prospering tremendously amid high food prices, TSCO has unsurprisingly delivered great financial results over the last year.Last quarter, for example, the company’s net sales jumped 21% versus the same period a year earlier, and its comparable store sales increased 8.6% YOY. Meanwhile, its operating income jumped 22.6% YOY to $359 million. For all of last year, its OI climbed 9.8% to $1.43 billion.And according to Investor’s Business Daily, the highest-rated 30% of stock funds over the last three years bought a huge $2.9 billion of TSCO stock during the previous three months.TSCO stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.7 times.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) sells cosmetics products. With travel continuing to be extremely popular and many Americans still very eager to socialize and attend events after being unable to do so for many months during the pandemic, the demand for Ulta’s products has been huge over the last two years. And that trend should continue to be very powerful in 2023.Last quarter, the retailer’s comparable sales soared 15.6% versus the same period a year earlier, “driven by a 13.6% increase in (the number of) transactions.” On the bottom line, its earnings per share climbed to $6.68 from $5.41. During Ulta’s fiscal 2022, its net income jumped 26%.During the retailer’s current fiscal year, it expects its earnings per share to come in at $24.70-$25.40, up from $24.01 last year.Speaking on Ulta’s Q4 earnings call held on March 9, CEO Dave Kimball noted that “Over the last two years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth,” driven by a number of factors, including new offerings, “new social media platforms, , return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.”He believes that some of these drivers will ease going forward, with others persisting. Overall, Kimbell predicted that the annual growth of “the beauty category” would be around 5%. Given Ulta’s strong position in the space, I expect it to grow at an 8%-10% clip this year.According to Investor’s Business Daily, the highest-rated 30% of stock funds over the last three years bought a hefty $278 million of ULTA stock over the last three months.ULTA stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.2 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.71 billion, down 9.63% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.19 per share and revenue of $31.6 billion.

He has been buying shares of the energy company since the beginning of 2022. As the global banking crisis and the resultant global growth worries weighed on oil prices recently, Buffett’s Berkshire bought the dip in Occidental Petroleum.According to the filing, Berkshire paid about $466.68 million for 7.9 million Occidental shares between March 13 and March 15, as quoted on Benzinga. Earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway restarted its buying of Occidental Petroleum shares after a break of five months.Berkshire Hathaway purchased more than 5.8 million shares of Occidental Petroleum between March 3 and March 7, being the first purchase of Occidental shares disclosed by Berkshire Hathaway after Sept 2022, according to a Reuters report that put the Buffett-owned firm's current stake in the company at 22.2%, the Benzinga article noted. Berkshire Hathaway's company now owns about 208.04 million Occidental shares.Notably, United States Oil Fund LP USO is off about 12% past month and Occidental Petroleum has lost about 9.1% past month (as of Mar 16, 2023). This has encouraged Buffett’s company to scoop up those shares at cheaper valuation.Occidental Has a Bullish OutlookOXY has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with upbeat industry rank. The stock has an upbeat VGM (Value-Growth-Momentum) score of B.What Do Indicators Say About Occidental’ Valuations?Going by valuation metrics, P/E (ttm) of OXY is 6.3 times versus the industry-average of 5.0 times. Forward P/E of OXY is 9.3 times versus the industry score of 6.2 times. Though these measures point to the higher valuation of Occidental than the industry, a higher P/E is always not a sign of worry. It shows investors’ confidence in a particular stock among the bunch.Investors should note that return-on-equity of Occidental is 52.7%, higher than industry average of 33.3%. The estimated 3-5-year EPS growth of Occidental is now 22.0% versus 11.1% of the industry measure.Story continuesETFs to TapTo tap Buffett’s optimism associated with Occidental Petroleum, investors can play Occidental-heavy ETFs as the basket approach reduces company-specific risks.First Trust Nasdaq Oil &amp; Gas ETF FTXN – OXY has 6.61% WeightPacer US Cash Cows Growth ETF BUL – OXY has 4.94% WeightInvesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF RYE – OXY has 4.29% WeightRoundhill MEME ETF MEME – OXY has 4.27% WeightFirst Trust Natural Gas ETF FCG – OXY has 3.72% WeightWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

239,d9e8737d-affb-3ae6-8255-ff2f48cdf9e0,BSX,2023-03-18,Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) Has Fared Decently But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead For The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-corporation-nyse-bsx-110050389.html,1679137250,STORY,['BSX'],"[Boston Scientific's (NYSE:BSX) stock is up by 4.7% over the past three months. However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Specifically, we decided to study Boston Scientific's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific How Is ROE Calculated?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boston Scientific is:4.0% = US$698m ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Boston Scientific's Earnings Growth And 4.0% ROEAs you can see, Boston Scientific's ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 11%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 4.1% seen by Boston Scientific was possibly a result of it having a lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Boston Scientific's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is BSX fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Boston Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Boston Scientific doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Boston Scientific can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement.

But these two financial institutions were relatively small. Moreover, Silvergate got into trouble primarily because it focused on the doomed crypto sector. At the same time, SVB made very poor investment decisions, took on too much debt, and was hurt by the anemic IPO market. Most analysts are saying that the banking sector as a whole does not have similar problems and is, in the words of Wells Fargo, “well-capitalized.” Meanwhile, heading into a pivotal election year, Washington unsurprisingly took major steps on March 12 to prevent a major banking crisis. And, by all accounts, the labor market remains extremely strong. The services sector on which the American economy is based is also still rapidly expanding, despite the Fed’s interest-rate hikes. Given these points, long-term investors should not fear buying the best consumer discretionary stocks.The three consumer discretionary names below are reporting great financial results, have strong, positive catalysts, and are trading at attractive valuations. Most importantly, big investors are pouring a great deal of money into them.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTickerCompanyPriceDKSDick’s Sporting Goods$149.36TSCOTractor Supply$229.03ULTAUlta Beauty$521.92Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks: Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.Source: George Sheldon via ShutterstockCapitalizing on America’s increased emphasis on health in general and fitness in particular since the pandemic, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) earlier this month reported exceptionally strong fourth-quarter results, given its status as a very large, well-established retailer.Specifically, the company’s revenue climbed 7.2% year-over-year to a record $3.6 billion, while its comparable store sales jumped 5.3% YOY. Compared with 2019, the retailer’s top line soared by 41%.Story continuesPushed down by inflation and supply-chain issues, Dick’s earnings per share, excluding certain items, did drop 20% to $2.93. But very encouragingly, CEO Lauren Hobart expects the retailer’s “merchandise margin” to climb this year. Moreover, Hobart provided 2023 EPS guidance of $12.90-$13.80. At the midpoint of that range, Dick’s EPS would climb 11% compared with 2022.And in a sign of tremendous confidence in its outlook, Dick’s raised its annual dividend by over 100% to $4 per share.Dick’s forward price-earnings ratio of 12.25 is quite attractive, while the stock’s 11% rally between March 6 and March 10, on very high volume and amid a struggling stock market, indicates that the “big money” has become quite fond of the shares.The retailer’s strong results, high dividend, and the big money’s confidence in it make it one of the best consumer discretionary stocks to buy now.Tractor Supply (TSCO)The exterior of a Tractor Supply (TSCO) storeSource: James R. Martin/Shutterstock.comTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) sells various products, including food for livestock and pets, to consumers. Ironside Research, a Seeking Alpha contributor, describes TSCO’s core customers as “the affluent rural.”With most American farmers prospering tremendously amid high food prices, TSCO has unsurprisingly delivered great financial results over the last year.Last quarter, for example, the company’s net sales jumped 21% versus the same period a year earlier, and its comparable store sales increased 8.6% YOY. Meanwhile, its operating income jumped 22.6% YOY to $359 million. For all of last year, its OI climbed 9.8% to $1.43 billion.And according to Investor’s Business Daily, the highest-rated 30% of stock funds over the last three years bought a huge $2.9 billion of TSCO stock during the previous three months.TSCO stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.7 times.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)ULTA stock Ulta Beauty store front sign located at Laurel Town Centre in Laurel, Maryland.Source: Ryan P Stephans / Shutterstock.comUlta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) sells cosmetics products. With travel continuing to be extremely popular and many Americans still very eager to socialize and attend events after being unable to do so for many months during the pandemic, the demand for Ulta’s products has been huge over the last two years. And that trend should continue to be very powerful in 2023.Last quarter, the retailer’s comparable sales soared 15.6% versus the same period a year earlier, “driven by a 13.6% increase in (the number of) transactions.” On the bottom line, its earnings per share climbed to $6.68 from $5.41. During Ulta’s fiscal 2022, its net income jumped 26%.During the retailer’s current fiscal year, it expects its earnings per share to come in at $24.70-$25.40, up from $24.01 last year.Speaking on Ulta’s Q4 earnings call held on March 9, CEO Dave Kimball noted that “Over the last two years, the U.S. beauty category experienced unprecedented growth,” driven by a number of factors, including new offerings, “new social media platforms, , return to work and resumed social activities, and the elevated connection between beauty and overall self-care.”He believes that some of these drivers will ease going forward, with others persisting. Overall, Kimbell predicted that the annual growth of “the beauty category” would be around 5%. Given Ulta’s strong position in the space, I expect it to grow at an 8%-10% clip this year.According to Investor’s Business Daily, the highest-rated 30% of stock funds over the last three years bought a hefty $278 million of ULTA stock over the last three months.ULTA stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.2 times.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 1.1%. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.19%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.27%.Heading into today, shares of the drugmaker had gained 2.94% over the past month, outpacing the Medical sector's loss of 2.4% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.02% in that time.Vertex Pharmaceuticals will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals to post earnings of $3.10 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 11.93%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.3 billion, up 9.66% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $14.21 per share and revenue of $9.64 billion. These totals would mark changes of -4.5% and +7.9%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Vertex Pharmaceuticals. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

248,02f5706f-f023-3155-86b1-fa4aa2b93840,VRTX,2023-03-18,Biogen Inc. (BIIB) Down 2.3% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biogen-inc-biib-down-2-153003922.html,1679067003,STORY,"['BIIB', 'VRTX']","[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Biogen Inc. (BIIB). Shares have lost about 2.3% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Biogen Inc. due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales BeatBiogen reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.05, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.51. Earnings rose 19% year over year, driven by lower costs.Sales came in at $2.54 billion, down 7% on a reported basis (4% on a constant-currency basis) from the year-ago quarter, hurt by lower sales of Tecfidera. However, sales of Spinraza improved in the quarter. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $2.44 billion and $2.43 billion, respectively.Product sales in the quarter were $1.91 billion, down 13% year over year. Revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs rose 8% from the year-ago period to $448 million. The revenues include royalties on sales of Roche’s Ocrevus and Biogen’s share of Roche’s drugs, Rituxan and Gazyva. Revenues from Ocrevus royalties increased 19%, partially offset by a 14% decline in revenues from profit share on Rituxan due to biosimilar competition. Contract manufacturing and royalty revenues rose 52% in the quarter to $192.0 million.Multiple Sclerosis RevenuesBiogen’s MS revenues were $1.27 billion in the reporter quarter, down 17% on a reported basis and 14% on a constant currency basis year over year.Tecfidera sales declined 39% to $297.1 million as multiple generic versions of the drug have been launched in the United States and new generic launches are ongoing in several EU countries. Tecfidera sales were better than our model estimate of $249.5 million as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $291 million.U.S. Tecfidera revenues declined 45.5% to $87.4 million. Outside U.S. revenues fell 35.7% to $209.7 million, hurt by generic competition in some markets. Biogen is seeing new generic launches in several EU countries.Biogen was granted an additional patent in the EU for Tecfidera, which is expected to expire in 2028. Biogen is filing actions to enforce this patent. It obtained preliminary injunctions in some countries to prevent generic entry. Generics continue to be sold in markets where preliminary injunctions are not in place.Vumerity recorded $150.8 million in sales, up 20.7%. Vumerity sales were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $153 million.Regarding supply constraints for Vumerity, Biogen said it has resolved the previously reported manufacturing issues at its contract manufacturer and is also working to get regulatory approvals for a secondary source of supply. Biogen does not expect a supply shortage in 2023.Total Fumarates (Tecfidera + Vumerity) revenues were $447.9 million in the quarter, down 26.7% year over year.Tysabri sales declined 4.7% year over year to $488.4 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $504 million.In 2023, Tecfidera revenues are expected to continue to decline as a result of increasing generic competition. Biogen expects increased sales volumes of Vumerity in 2023 compared with 2022, mostly driven by demand growth. Tysabri revenues are expected to be flat in 2023 compared with 2022 despite increased competitive pressure and price reductions in certain European markets. A potential biosimilar of Tysabri may be launched in the United States and European markets as early as 2023.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the quarter were $309.6 million, down 17.9%, hurt by a continued shift from the injectable platform to oral or high-efficacy therapies.Story continuesOther ProductsSales of Spinraza rose 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis to $459.0 million. Spinraza sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $427 million.Spinraza’s U.S. sales rose 5% year over year. Biogen said it is seeing some signs of stabilization in patient use in the United States.In ex-U.S. markets, Spinraza sales rose 4% at actual currency and 12% at constant currency due to volume growth in certain Asian markets, partially offset by increased competition in Europe.In 2023, Spinraza’s sales growth is expected to be relatively flat from the 2022 level. Moderate growth in the United States and the emerging markets is expected to be offset by the impact of increased competition and loading dose dynamics as patients transition to dosing once every four months.In the quarter, biosimilars revenues decreased 21% year over year (15% in constant currency) to $175 million due to pricing pressure and some net pricing adjustments in the quarter. Biogen announced with its fourth-quarter results that it is considering strategic options for its biosimilars business.Biosimilars revenues are expected to be modest in 2023 as continued launch of Byooviz is expected to make up for pricing pressure in certain markets.Alzheimer’s drug, Aduhelm recorded sales of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $1.6 million in the previous quarter. Fumaderm sales were $1.8 million, down 33.3% year over year.Research and development expenses were $602.0 million, down 14% year over year. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses declined 19% year over year to $632.0 million due to the company’s cost-savings initiatives.Biogen repurchased 3.6 million shares worth $70 million in 2022. No shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2022. Biogen had $2.05 billion remaining under its share buyback plan of $5 billion, which was authorized in October 2020.2022 ResultsFor 2022, Biogen generated revenues of $10.17 billion, down 7% year over year on a reported basis and 5% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.07 billion and came ahead of the guidance range of $10.0 to $10.15 billion.Earnings were $17.67 per share, down 8% year over year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.13 and exceeded the guidance range of $16.50 to $17.15.2023 Guidance IssuedThe company issued fresh earnings and sales guidance for 2023.Total revenues are expected to decline at a mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 from the 2022 level.Biogen expects Leqembi to generate “modest in-market revenue” in 2023 though costs to market the drug will exceed revenues. The drug is not expected to contribute much to revenues until the CMS grants reimbursement for the drug under Medicare plans. This is expected to happen once Leqembi gets traditional approval. Accordingly, Leqembi will represent a negative headwind to revenues in 2023.In October, the advocate general of the European Court of Justice issued a non-binding advisory opinion. Biogen expects Tecfidera to have statutory market protection in Europe until at least February 2024, if the court adopts the advisory opinion. The guidance assumes a favorable decision by the European Court of Justice relating to generic entry for Tecfidera in Europe.Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of $15.00 to $16.00 per share.Biogen expects R&amp;D costs to increase by approximately $100 million in 2023 as it will no longer be sharing Aduhelm R&amp;D costs with Eisai. Overall, operating expenses are expected to increase in 2023 due to investments to support potential news launches (Leqembi and zuranolone).First-Quarter 2023 OutlookThe first quarter is a seasonally weaker quarter compared with the fourth quarter for the U.S. MS business due to channel dynamics and the higher discounts and allowances. The fourth quarter of 2022 benefited from the favorable timing of some shipments of Spinraza, which is expected to reverse in the first quarter of 2023. Operating expenses are also expected to be higher earlier in the year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -17.98% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Biogen Inc. has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Biogen Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerBiogen Inc. is part of the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Over the past month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.9%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.Vertex reported revenues of $2.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $3.76 for the same period compares with $3.37 a year ago.For the current quarter, Vertex is expected to post earnings of $3.10 per share, indicating a change of -11.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.The overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Vertex.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, Textron has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Airbus Group has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TXT is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.TXT currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.54, while EADSY has a forward P/E of 21.17. We also note that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1.21. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. EADSY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.71.Another notable valuation metric for TXT is its P/B ratio of 1.98. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, EADSY has a P/B of 15.58.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help TXT earn a Value grade of A, while EADSY has been given a Value grade of C.TXT stands above EADSY thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that TXT is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Waste Management How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Waste Management is:33% = US$2.2b ÷ US$6.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.Does Waste Management Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Waste Management has a superior ROE than the average (13%) in the Commercial Services industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Waste Management visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Waste Management's Debt And Its 33% Return On EquityWaste Management does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 2.14. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Waste Management may not be the best stock to buy.

However, an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 21 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last eight quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Better pricing ensures improved premiums and prudent claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023The insurance industry is rate sensitive. The Fed has already made seven hikes in 2022 and one this year. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers. The Fed has announced taking the interest rate to 5.1% in 2023. The current federal interest rate currently stands at 4.75%. Thus, there is more room for rate hikes in 2023.Catastrophic events weigh on the underwriting profitability of insurers.

Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.While a solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level continues to aid insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.The industry has declined 3.3% year to date versus the Finance sector’s decrease of 2.7% and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s rise of 3.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHere we focus on two property and casualty insurers, namely Cincinnati Financial Corporation CINF and CNA Financial Corporation CNA.  Cincinnati Financial, with a market capitalization of $17.4 billion, markets property and casualty insurance.

259,84f6c22c-f344-33af-94be-8ff30006fb9b,VLO,2023-03-18,Here's Why Murphy USA (MUSA) is a Compelling Energy Pick,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-murphy-usa-musa-142202343.html,1679062922,STORY,"['MUSA', 'SUN', 'VLO']","[Leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States, Murphy USA MUSA has been impressive over the past year. The company also has strong earnings trends to back up its performance.This El Dorado, AR-based company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2013 spin-off of Murphy Oil Corporation’s downstream business into a separate, independent and publicly-traded entity. Murphy USA markets refined products through a chain of retail stations, almost all of which are located near a Walmart supercenter, primarily in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest United States.Let’s discuss the reasons that make Murphy USA an attractive pick:Macro TailwindsEven as fears revolving around high inflation and slowing growth somewhat cloud the outlook for Oil/Energy, it has remained the best S&amp;P 500 sector over the past year. The space has generated a total return of around 9.4% in the past 12 months compared with the S&amp;P 500’s loss of 9.1%. Apart from a relatively constructive fundamental picture, the sector is enjoying support from geopolitical uncertainty amid Russia’s military operations in Ukraine. In March 2022, crude prices surged to multi-year highs of $130 on concerns about supplies from Russia, which is one of the world's largest producers of the commodity.Agreed, oil has pulled back from those lofty levels, However, the commodity still has enough reasons to stay elevated in the near-to-medium term, with the conflict showing no signs of a quick resolution, the risk of dwindling inventory and the influential oil exporters’ group OPEC sticking to a conservative production profile.Solid Rank and VGM ScoreMurphy USA is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry, which carries a Zacks Industry Rank #17. Its industry rank places it in the top 7% of around 250 Zacks industries. In addition to the favorable rank, MUSA enjoys a Value and Growth Score of A and B, respectively, each helping it round out with a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential.Story continuesCurrent Pullback a Buying OpportunityAfter MUSA shares bottomed out (around $80) during the start of the pandemic, they have turned it around in style. Murphy USA peaked in October at $323 but has fallen to around $250 since then. Despite this drop, the stock is still up 27.4% in a year while the markets have gone lower. This powerful uptrend during a bear market indicates that investors should take advantage of the discounted levels and start looking at the name to see if it’s right for their portfolio. With the company experiencing the best market conditions in years, we believe that the MUSA stock has enough firepower left to keep chugging along.Analyst Estimates RaisedMUSA’s earnings revisions have also trended in the right direction over the past 60 days, as analysts have consistently taken up their numbers. As a matter of fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Murphy USA’s 2023 bottom line has gone up from a profit of $17.79 to a profit of $18.40 during this timeframe, while the next year’s projection has gone up from a profit of $15.25 per share to $17.83.Fundamental StrengthMurphy USA’s unique high-volume, low-cost business model helps it retain high profitability even in the fiercely competitive retail environment. The company, which sells more than 4 billion gallons of retail fuel annually, owns more than 90% of its gasoline stations. This allows Murphy USA to keep its operating expenses low. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract, thereby driving above-average fuel sales volume.The industry’s improved fundamentals in the form of constrained supply and robust demand for refined products like gasoline have led to rising refining profitability for the players involved. As a reflection of this, Murphy USA’s average retail gasoline price in 2022 came in at $3.63 per gallon, up from $2.63 per gallon a year ago.Murphy USA’s 2021 acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — has helped the company to improve its offerings. In particular, QuickChek’s presence in large population centers like the New Jersey/New York region is likely to have driven Murphy USA’s merchandise revenues and margins.Finally, MUSA’s disciplined capital allocation strategy between growth and stock buybacks has been a key differentiator. While organic growth remains the top priority for Murphy USA, the company’s high cash flow generating ability is expected to support its $1 billion repurchase plan.Bottom LineGiven this backdrop, it should be prudent to consider buying shares of Murphy USA. While there are some apprehensions that the company may have gotten too far ahead of itself, especially with the prevailing inflationary pressure, the tightness in product demand should keep gasoline margins elevated going forward. This suggests strong long-term cash flows that should support higher price points for its shares.Other Energy Stocks to BuyAlong with Murphy USA, investors interested in the energy sector might look at operators like NOW Inc. DNOW, Valero Energy VLO and Sunoco LP SUN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) currently.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NOW Inc.: DNOW beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters.

260,99007c52-f10f-3de1-90bb-9c47950a3c06,VLO,2023-03-18,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Valero Energy, AXA, Siemens Aktiengesellschaft and SSE",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-valero-121512246.html,1679055312,STORY,"['VLO', 'SIE.DE', 'SIEGY', 'AXAHY', 'SSEZF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – March 17, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Valero Energy Corp. VLO, AXA SA AXAHY, Siemens Aktiengesellschaft SIEGY and SSE plc SSEZY.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Listen to the Experts When Preparing to Buy StocksAnalyst opinion this year has varied widely on the possibility and timing of a recession. Some said that a recession was not likely, given the strength in labor. Others said that we are only putting off what's bound to happen because rate hikes in the past have always gone too far, with the economy inevitably slipping into a recession. Others pointed out that we've had a couple of quarters of negative GDP already and the improvement in the back half of 2022 is muted since the December quarter was weaker than September.CPI and PPI still look to be a challenge and manufacturing is not doing that well. The housing market is treading water. So while we may not technically be in a recession, we sure seem to be headed that way. Therefore, some estimate an official recession in the back half of this year while a few think it could happen in 2024.With nearly a whole quarter into 2023, this picture has not changed much. We still may or may not be headed to a recession. But disconcerting news continues to pour in. With two U.S. banks going down, Credit Suisse in trouble stoking fears of a global slowdown, and First Republic Bank exploring options including a sale, things certainly aren't looking pretty. The fear of a global slowdown is taking a toll on oil prices, which are cooling down rapidly.Investors pulling out of banks and depositors looking for other alternatives need safer options for their cash. And strange though it may seem, the stock market still offers opportunities. The one thing I would avoid right now is an expensive stock -- even one with good long term prospects -- unless you really have the stomach for it. And even if you do, there are certainly cheaper options out there. A winning combination would be one with improving prospects and declining prices, but that may be too much to hope for.Story continuesIn general, though, improving prospects are reflected in earnings estimates. So when estimates rise, the potential cash flows to the company also rise. Rising cash flows raise the intrinsic value of the shares, encouraging investors to pay more for them. And as more investors get into a stock it can create a kind of momentum that attracts even more investors. Therefore, rising estimates tend to send shares up or at least keep them buoyant in the most trying circumstances.And to take this a step further, it might be a good idea to also check the average broker rating on a stock. If the majority of brokers are in favor of buying the shares, the average broker rating would reflect a Buy recommendation. It goes without saying that the larger the number of brokers in the recommendation, the safer the selection, since a single broker could make a mistake but the majority rarely would. If after checking all these, you find companies that also pay dividends, then that's even better. Who wouldn't want some buffer in these uncertain times?With this in mind, I've selected a few stocks that may be worth adding to your portfolio. Let's take a look:Valero Energy Corp.San Antonio, Texas-based Valero Energy manufactures and sells transportation fuels and petrochemical products in the U.S., Canada, UK and Ireland. The company operates through three segments: Refining, Renewable Diesel and Ethanol.The average broker rating of 1.21 on Valero shares translates to a Strong Buy rating and considering the fact that 14 brokers are contributing to this average, the chances of error are low.The Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) coupled with a Zacks-classified industry (Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing) position in the top 8%, there is a good chance of near-term upside.Estimates on this stock continue to rise steadily. In the last 30 days, they've jumped 60 cents (2.5%). Estimates for 2024 increased a couple of cents during the same period.Valero's dividend yields 3.28%.The shares trade at a P/E of 5.47X, close to the industry's 5.45X. They are however trading at a 14.3% discount to their median level over the past year. Therefore, they may be considered cheap.AXA SAParis, France-based AXA provides insurance, asset management and banking services worldwide. The company operates through France, Europe, Asia, AXA XL, International and Transversal &amp; Central Holdings segments. It offers life and savings insurance products, such as savings and retirement, health and personal protection products.The average broker rating of 1.00 implies a Strong Buy sentiment from the four contributing brokers.The Zacks #2 (Buy) rank on the stock and its position in the Insurance - Multi line industry which is in top 23% are also positive.As may be expected, estimates on this stock are on the rise. The 2023 EPS estimate is up 14 cents (3.9%) in the last 30 days and the 2024 estimate is up 30 cents (7.9%).AXA also pays a dividend that currently yields 4.72%.The shares trade at 7.41X P/E, which is a 12.0% discount to the industry and 6.8% discount to its median level over the past year. So they are cheap by both considerations.Siemens AktiengesellschaftMunich, Germany-based Siemens Aktiengesellschaft sells automation and digitization software and systems into industrial, energy, automotive, healthcare and IoT markets, as well as financial services in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the Americas, Asia and Australia.The average rating of 2.00 from the contributing six brokers matches the Buy rating from Zacks. Although not as exciting as some of the others, this rating too suggests that buying the shares would not be out of line. Moreover, the stock belongs to the Industrial Services industry, which is in the top 12% of Zacks-classified industries, further supporting accumulation.The estimate revisions trend is also supportive. For the year ending in September 2023, the EPS estimate is up 13 cents (2.9%) in the last 30 days while for 2024, it is up 14 cents (2.8%).Siemens' dividend yields 2.28%.Siemens shares trade at a 28.8% discount to the industry. Therefore, although this is a 12.9% premium to its median value over the past year, further upside may be possible, or at least downside risk looks limited.SSE plcPerth, UK-based SSE is involved in electricity generation (from water, gas, coal, oil, other), transmission, distribution and supply to approximately 3.8 million homes and businesses across northern-central Scotland and central-southern England. The company also owns, operates and develops high voltage electricity transmission systems in the north of Scotland and remote islands. It also produces, stores, distributes, and supplies gas. Other lines of business include electricity and utility contracting, telecommunications, energy trading, insurance and property holding, and maintenance services.Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) ranked SSE belongs to the Electronics - Power Generation industry, placing it in the top 8% of industries. This normally indicates upside potential.Sell-side analysts are also rooting for the stock: their average recommendation of 1.83 translates to a Buy rating.Estimates for the year ending in March 2023 have jumped 33 cents (23.7%) while 2024 estimates have increased 35 cents (22.3%).SSE also pays a dividend that currently yields 3.13%.The shares are trading at a 25.4% premium to the industry but at a 30.2% discount to its median value over the past year. While in the past the shares have mostly traded at a premium to the industry, the current premium to its median value looks a but too much. Therefore, upside potential exists.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

261,c02bace5-3cff-399a-979c-6052231deeca,UNH,2023-03-18,"5 HMO Stocks to Watch Despite Elevated Tech Costs, Nursing Shortage",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hmo-stocks-watch-despite-151903771.html,1679066343,STORY,['UNH'],"[The U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is likely to benefit from a solid Government business that fetches higher premiums to industry players. Contract wins, a growing customer base and a solid merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy are added tailwinds for the space. Though technology investments are pursued to expand digital capabilities, they might often elevate costs for industry participants. Shortage of nurses is another headwind. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH are better placed to counter the industry downsides.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Defining the HMO Industry FutureContinuous Technology Advancements: Owing to the ongoing digitization across every sphere of life, individuals often prefer healthcare services from the comfort of their homes. The demand for digital healthcare services is expected to remain high in the days ahead. As a result, players in the HMO space are compelled to undertake significant technology investments to stay up-to-date with the digital trend. Digital investments for health insurers are often directed toward developing telehealth platforms and boosting operational efficiencies. This, in turn, expands digital capabilities and diversifies revenue streams of the players. However, bringing its share of worries, these investments might escalate costs and dampen the margins of health insurers.Story continuesScarcity of Nurses: The U.S. healthcare industry has been grappling with an acute shortage of nurses and other medical personnel for quite some. As more U.S. people continue to reach retirement age, the nursing shortage will likely persist. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to arrange for discounted care access for plan members. This feature remains lucrative for individuals to opt for a particular health insurer’s plan. Thereby, an insufficient nursing workforce can dampen a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services to the plan members. This, in turn, can indirectly impact the customer base of health insurers. It can be problematic as the premiums of the HMO players depend, to a large extent, on healthy membership growth. According to a McKinsey report, the United States will likely see a dearth of 200,000 to 450,000 nurses within 2025. This further points toward the challenging days that await health insurers.Growing Premiums: A well-performing Government business provides an impetus to the most vital component of a health insurer’s top line —  premiums. Through this business, the insurers devise affordable health plans and extend them across several U.S. communities. These plans, integrated with some eye-catchy features, fetch federal or state contracts to the HMO players from time to time. These contract wins boost their customer base. An aging U.S. population sounds well for health insurers as it can sustain the demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above) offered through Government business. But the continued impact of inflation can take a toll on the spending habits of consumers and infuse some uncertainty in their uninterrupted healthcare premium payments.An Active M&amp;A Strategy: Participants of the HMO space frequently resort to the M&amp;A strategy to upgrade their capabilities and solidify their nationwide presence. Industry players place a keen eye on M&amp;A strategy to increase customer base, introduce new products and services, enter new markets and delve deeper into existing ones. The primary aim behind these deals is to bring diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. An exciting year awaits, with respect to M&amp;A deals, according to PwC’s Global M&amp;A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #219, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can buy or retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth looking at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has lost 7.9% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 14.1% decline and the Zacks Medical sector’s decline of 18.6%.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 16.84X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.46X and the sector’s 21.72X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.49X and as low as 12.93X, with the median being at 17.93X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12-Month Price/Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye onWe present five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group benefits on the back of strong contributions from its UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses. Several contract wins have resulted in the membership growth of UNH, which in turn, boosts its top line. It pursues an M&amp;A strategy, which has bolstered its capabilities and extended its nationwide presence. Robust Medicare and Medicaid plans have extended UNH’s access across inaccessible regions. The healthcare provider has resorted to developing telehealth services for which it has undertaken significant investments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.91 per share, indicating a 12.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues indicates a 10.7% improvement from the year-ago actual. UNH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.38%. Even though its shares have lost 6.7% in a year, solid fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Price &amp; Consensus: UNHZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to be driven by solid performances of the Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare segments. CI has maintained a solid record of reporting average annual adjusted earnings per share growth higher than the long-term target of 6-8%. An aging U.S. population is expected to sustain solid demand for Cigna’s Medicare plans. It also benefits on the back of continuous product expansions and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.77 per share, suggesting 6.5% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues implies a 3.9% improvement from the year-ago actual. CI’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 9.98%. Its shares have gained 13.8% in a year.Price &amp; Consensus: CIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana: Headquartered in Kentucky, Humana is aided by growing premium revenues from an increasing customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The strength of the cost-effective health plans devised by HUM continues to fetch numerous contract wins and renewed agreements with the company from time to time. An array of buyouts undertaken over the years, such as those of Family Physicians Group, onehome, Curo and Inclusa, has expanded Humana’s capabilities and diversified income streams.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $28.06 per share, indicating a 11.2% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 11.5% growth from the year-ago actual. HUM’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 12.95%. Its shares have rallied 12.% in a year.Price &amp; Consensus: HUMZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCentene: Based in Missouri, Centene’s revenues witnessed an uptick from strength in its Medicare and Medicaid businesses. A well-diversified healthcare suite and solid nationwide presence have fetched numerous contract wins and deal renewals for CNC. It follows an inorganic growth route, which in turn, bolsters its capabilities and provides an opportunity to boost top-line growth. Partnerships with healthcare providers of a particular region enable CNC to deliver effective healthcare services and better serve the local community.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.34 per share, indicating a 9.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure. CNC’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed the mark once, the average being 4.16%. Its shares have lost 28% in a year, but solid fundamentals of the stock will likely help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Price &amp; Consensus: CNCZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Molina Healthcare:  This California-based health insurer is driven by a well-performing Government business. The business enables MOH to devise affordable Medicare and Medicare plans based on which it wins several contracts from time to time. Such contract wins result in a growing customer base for MOH.

262,878b3469-2759-373d-9047-6b467388f507,UNH,2023-03-18,Wall Street Analysts See UnitedHealth (UNH) as a Buy: Should You Invest?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-unitedhealth-133001520.html,1679059801,STORY,['UNH'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about UnitedHealth Group (UNH) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.UnitedHealth currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.45, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 19 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.45 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 19 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.4% and 15.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for UNHBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for UNHCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for UnitedHealth here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying UnitedHealth, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is UNH Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for UnitedHealth, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $24.91.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for UnitedHealth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pricing actions have played a key role in uplifting sales trends for industry participants. The companies focused on transforming operations, digital commerce growth, innovation and brand building have been gaining amid macro hardships.Nevertheless, the companies continue to toil with headwinds related to higher manufacturing and logistic costs, increased commodity costs, and lower volume. Also, elevated advertising and sales promotion spending is expected to dent margins in the near term. Some of the players have been undertaking cost-curtailment actions to support margins, while coming up with the latest products and improved marketing efforts. Companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG, Colgate-Palmolive CL, Henkel AG &amp; Co. HENKY, Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. CHD and The Clorox Company CLX have stayed upright on these efforts despite the continued cost inflation.About the IndustryCompanies involved in the manufacturing and supply of fast-moving consumer goods, including personal care, household and specialty products, primarily make up the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry. The personal care segment comprises skin and hair care products, deodorants, and oral care items. The household category covers home care products, including laundry care, house cleaning agents, bleaching products, air care, dishwashing liquids and other cleaning items. Laundry detergent is one of the largest markets among the above-mentioned ones. A few players in this space also offer baby and feminine care items. Some companies offer pet care products. These companies market and sell products through supermarkets, mass merchandisers, grocery stores, distributors, wholesalers, department stores, drugstores, specialty stores, dollar stores and pet stores, and websites.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Soaps &amp; Cleaning Materials IndustryFavorable Demand Trends &amp; Pricing Actions: The soaps and cleaning materials industry has been experiencing revived demand trends across markets. Solid demand for its products and brands, owing to continued brand relevance, and a favorable price mix have been boosting industry participants’ performance. Industry players have also been witnessing improved organic sales trends mainly on gains from robust pricing actions and revenue management initiatives. The companies have been adopting bold pricing initiatives across markets to combat rising costs due to the persistence of inflation, higher freight and currency woes. Some companies have resorted to cost-based pricing actions, which have proved beneficial.Product Innovation &amp; Strategic Efforts: Investments in product development to suit consumers’ changing needs have been supporting the companies in the soaps and cleaning products space. Investments in innovation, product portfolio and digital capabilities have been the key to driving sales of companies. Additionally, the players have been undertaking pricing, packaging and marketing initiatives, along with restructuring actions, including acquisitions and divestitures. Companies are also looking to expand into new markets and channels. Developing products with eco-friendly and natural ingredients is another area of focus among industry players, as consumers increasingly prefer environment-friendly ingredients in their daily use items. The online availability of products has been another key sales driver across various markets due to convenience and ease of shopping. Consumer goods companies are undertaking productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins.Elevated Costs: The soaps and cleaning materials industry players have been grappling with escalating raw material and logistic costs, particularly transportation, due to supply-chain issues and current industry dynamics. These have been hurting the industry participants’ margins. Elevated manufacturing and distribution costs, as well as increased advertising and sales promotion expenses, are other factors impacting margins. Additionally, the companies have been incurring higher SG&amp;A expenses on account of increased operational costs related to salaries and bonuses, as well as planned investments in digital capabilities and productivity enhancements. To overcome these shortcomings and improve margins, some players are focusing on cost-containment initiatives, including streamlining the supply chain and minimizing overhead costs. Most companies are resorting to price increases to cushion their margins.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #98, which places it in the top 39% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.We here present a few stocks that one can retain in their portfolio, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it is worth taking a look at the industry’s performance and current valuation.Industry Vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector and the S&amp;P 500 index in the past year.The industry has lost 2% in the past year compared with the broader sector’s and the S&amp;P 500’s declines of 2.9% and 14.1%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing Consumer Staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 21.87X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.46X and the sector’s 18.1X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.13X and as low as 17.56X, the median being 22.15X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)5 Stocks to Keep a Close WatchProcter &amp; Gamble: The Cincinnati, OH-based consumer goods giant has been benefiting from strength across all segments, coupled with robust volume, pricing and mix.

But the problem is that you never know for sure where the lowest or highest prices are.Regardless of price, with real estate investment trusts (REITs), buying low can often mean purchasing a stock for life with a very high dividend yield. Will that high dividend yield soon disappear with a nasty dividend cut, or is it an opportunity to lock it in for the long term?Take a look at three REITs that have been crushed in price over the past four weeks and now sport dividend yields much higher than their five-year averages. Are they yield traps or bargains? The following information may help you decide.Uniti Group Inc. (NASDAQ: UNIT) is a Little Rock, Arkansas-based specialty REIT that acquires and constructs mission-critical communications infrastructure in the form of fiber optics, copper and coaxial broadband networks.Uniti Group currently owns and operates 129,000 fiber route miles covering 270,000 commercial buildings, with most of its network in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. It’s one of the 10 largest fiber providers in the U.S. today. Its fiber optic leasing to anchor customers generates about 70% of its total revenue.Uniti Group pays a $0.15 quarterly dividend and its $0.60 annual dividend now pays 16%. The five-year average dividend yield is 8.86%.On March 10, President and CEO Kenny Gunderman bought 225,000 shares of Uniti Group stock at an approximate price of $4.37. The total transaction was $983,250. Does it seem logical that Gunderman would buy almost $1 million worth of stock now if he thought there was a possibility of a looming dividend cut?With forward annual funds from operations (FFO) of $1.03 and the forward annual dividend rate of $0.60, Uniti Group’s FFO payout ratio is 61%, which usually means a dividend is fairly safe.Story continuesBut Uniti Group is not without its risks. Its fourth-quarter results were mixed with revenue missing analysts’ target but FFO coming in above expectations. Forward guidance for 2023 was also below analysts’ expectations.This may all be baked into the stock price at this point. Uniti Group’s total return over the past four weeks is negative 34.05%. With a recent price of $3.71 and a price/FFO (P/FFO) of only $3.60, Uniti Group could be a tremendous bargain for investors with a long-term horizon. At present levels, an investor would be buying the stock at a 15% discount to what the CEO just paid. SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is an office REIT and the largest landlord of New York City office space, with 33.1 million square feet in 61 buildings.At a recent price of $27.41, SL Green shares are now below the COVID lows of 2020. One factor weighing on SL Green’s performance is its high short position of 15.46%, as investors bet that the work-from-home movement will continue and office occupancy levels will decline.But many companies are starting to require workers to return to the office, either full or part time. And New York City subway ridership numbers have been moving higher, which could indicate more workers are returning to offices.SL Green pays a monthly dividend of $0.271 per share. The annual dividend of $3.25 presently yields 11.7%. SL Green cut its monthly dividend by 12.8% from $0.311 in December, and its debt-to-equity ratio of 128 is still quite high, so there is some risk that the board of directors could decide to do it again.But the FFO payout ratio is only 59.7%, so there is little risk that SL Green will not meet its dividend obligations. The five-year dividend yield average is 5.39%, implying a grossly undervalued stock price. SL Green stock has a total return over the past four weeks of negative 29.49%.Morgan Stanley recently maintained an Equal Weight position on SL Green, while lowering its target price from $38 to $35. That gives SL Green a potential upside of 27.6%. Between the high dividend yield and the potential appreciation, SL Green could be a bargain right now, but it’s a long-term play. Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) is another large New York City landlord of offices and retail properties. Like SL Green, Vornado Realty has a high short interest level of 8.95%.The quarterly dividend is $0.375, and the annual dividend of $1.50 presently yields 9.4%. The five-year average dividend is 5.43%, and the FFO payout ratio is only 55.9%. But Vornado Realty also cut its dividend in January, from $0.53 to $0.375 per share, a 29% decline. The cut reduced its FFO payout ratio down from 79%.Vornado Realty’s fourth-quarter results were also mixed, with FFO of $0.72 beating estimates by $0.05, but revenue of $446.94 million falling below Street estimates of $452.88 million.On March 3, BMO Capital downgraded Vornado Realty from Market Perform to Underperform and lowered the price target from $26 to $18. On March 9, Morgan Stanley maintained its Underweight position on Vornado Realty, while lowering the price target from $19 to $18. Analysts said Vornado Realty will have many more lease expirations over the next two years than rival SL Green, and debt levels and expenses will continue to affect its bottom line.While the FFO payout ratio is at a safe level, the recent dividend cut and warnings about its lease expirations put this office REIT at a higher risk of being a yield trap than a bargain. Vornado Realty’s total return over the past four weeks is negative 29.67%, so more adventurous investors may be tempted to make this a contrarian type of purchase. But Vornado Realty will need to prove its dividend is stable for a few more quarters before more conservative investors can have confidence in this REIT.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

But in the coming months, inflation is widely expected to drop sharply. With that, now is a good time for long-term investors to find technology stocks to buy.For example, EY’s head economist, Gregory Daco, predicted last month that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) would tumble to 2.3% by the final month of this year. Meanwhile, in the wake of last weekend’s bank failures, some analysts predict that the central bank won’t raise rates anymore for the foreseeable future, while most others think that the Fed is only going to hike by roughly three-quarters of a percent for the rest of the year.So with inflation sinking and the Fed getting ready to pause, again now is a good time for long-term investors to find technology stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJBLJabil$81.93ETNEaton Corporation$169.58AVGOBroadcom$622.96FTNTFortinet$60.30ICADiCAD$1.44ROKURoku$60.77PUBMPubMatic$13.19Jabil (JBL)Graphic of side view of virtual financial charts with tech aesthetic, symbolizing fintechSource: shutterstock.com/whiteMoccaJabil (NYSE:JBL) manufactures electronic systems and components.  Its customers include automakers, data centers, and defense and aerospace companies. According to Seeking Alpha columnist Mike Zaccardi, Jabil is well-positioned to benefit from China’s relaxation of anti-coronavirus measures. Moreover, the columnist thinks that the company is “leveraged to…EV, renewable energy, and broader infrastructure.” With all three of those sectors growing rapidly and China’s economy poised to accelerate, Jabil should report very strong financial results this year.Meanwhile, the “smart money” appears to be very enthusiastic about JBL stock. Indeed, according to Investor’s Business Daily, the highest-rated 30% of stock funds over the last three years bought a fairly large total of $457 million of JBL stock in the last three months. Also noteworthy is that Jabil has a very low forward price-earnings ratio of just 10.Story continuesEaton Corporation (ETN)Close up of phone with creative forex chart on blue background. Trade, finance, technology and communication concept. 3D Rendering. Tech Stocks to Buy Before the Bull Market ReturnsSource: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.comAnother company that’s focused on electricity equipment, Eaton (NYSE:ETN), creates “electric components” and “power distribution” systems. It also develops “power reliability equipment and services,” and sells many components of commercial airplanes.As a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, D.C. is poised to spend a great deal of money on improving the electric grid. In fact,  the Biden administration plans to distribute $10.5 billion to bolster “the resilience and reliability of America’s electric grid.” Given Eaton’s focus on “electric components” and “power distribution” systems, those expenditures should greatly boost the company’s financial results and ETN stock.In fact, the government’s spending may already be lifting Eaton’s financial results, since, last quarter, the company’s “Electrical sector backlog soared 75% year-over-year, and [overall] its free cash flow jumped 36% YOY.”Meanwhile, the commercial airline sector appears to be thriving, as travel trends worldwide seem to be very strong. As evidence of the latter assertion, consider that General Electric (NYSE:GE) expects the bottom line of its Aerospace division to jump to $7.8 billion in 2025 from $5.5 billion in 2023, while Saudi Arabia is launching its own airlines and is reportedly “close to committing to a big order” of planes from Boeing (NYSE:BA).Analysts, on average, expect Eaton’s earnings per share to climb to $9.13 next year from $8.29 this year. The company’s EPS in 2022 was $7.57. ETN stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 21.5.Broadcom (AVGO)A concept image of robot hands with stock information in between themSource: Blue Planet Studio / ShutterstockChip maker Tokyo Electron expects global chip demand to “return to an exponential growth path next year,”  Bloomberg reported. Given the proliferation of AI, connected cars, and data centers, that assessment certainly seems legitimate to, and it’s positive for one of the world’s largest chip makers, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).Meanwhile, despite relatively weak chip demand amid consumers’ goods-to-services shift, Broadcom on March 2 reported quite strong results for its fiscal first quarter. Specifically, its revenue climbed 15.7% versus the same period a year earlier to $8.9 billion, and its net income soared 54% year-over-year to $3.77 bullion. Multiple banks were understandably very upbeat about AVGO stock in the wake of its results.For example. Bank of America wrote that the stock ” provides perhaps the most compellingly valued exposure to the fast-growing generative AI market.” The bank raised its price target on the shares to $725 and kept a “buy” rating on the name. Trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of just 14.8 and giving investors a dividend yield of 3%, AVGO stock looks like a great bargain at its current levels.Fortinet (FTNT)a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockGlobal cybersecurity spending will climb 13% this year,  research firm Canalys has predicted. That’s very good news for Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), one of America’s largest and most successful cybersecurity firms.Meanwhile, the Biden administration’s decision to develop a “comprehensive plan to regulate the security practices of cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle” looks poised to generate a great deal of additional growth for Fortinet.FTNT expects its product sales to climb 15% this year, and the company says that its ASIC chip enables it to offer more comprehensive, lower-cost products than its competitors. Analysts, on average, expect the company’s earnings per share to increase to $1.41 this year and $1.67 next year versus $1.19 in 2022. Also importantly,  the “smart money” appears to be enthusiastic about JBL stock.  That’s because Investor’s Business Daily reports that the highest-rated 30% of stock funds over the last three years bought a fairly large total of $102 million of FTNT stock in the last three months.iCAD (ICAD)DNA strand and Cancer Cell Oncology Research Concept 3D rendering. LIXT StockSource: CI Photos / Shutterstock.comA small quarterly revenue miss and an abrupt CEO change have caused iCAD (NASDAQ:ICAD) stock to drop sharply. The company markets its AI-based system that detects breast cancer. On March 13, the company announced that its CEO, Stacey Stevens, was stepping down due to “personal reasons.” On the same day, iCAD disclosed that it expected to report Q4 revenue of $6.5 million, slightly below analysts’ average estimate of $6.6 million.In typical Street fashion, large investors decided to sell first and think critically and strategically later, causing ICAD stock to tumble 35% on March 13.But long-term investors should consider a few important points about ICAD. First, after the decline of the shares, the stock has a tiny market capitalization of just $39.2 million.  Secondly, as I pointed out previously, Alphabet signed a deal to incorporate its AI technology into iCAD’s products, likely validating iCAD’s technology and probably giving Alphabet a financial incentive to market iCAD’s systems.As for the departure of Stevens, iCAD’s CEO, I think the development likely reflects Alphabet’s desire to work with a CEO with which it already has a solid relationship. And in a positive sign for ICAD stock, one of its board members, Rakesh Patel, on March 9 activated options on over 48,000 shares of ICAD stock “with an exercise price of $3.03.” With ICAD trading around the $1.60 level, investors should take a hint from Patel and exploit the overdone decline to acquire its shares. In my view, ICAD is definitely one of the best technology stocks to buy at this point.Roku (ROKU)The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock tumbled nearly 10% last week on news that 26% of its cash had been deposited at Silicon Valley Bank. Unfortunately,  Roku’s shares have not recovered much this week. However, after D.C. guaranteed that depositors would immediately receive all of the funds that they had at the failed bank, the decline of Roku created a good buying opportunity. Worth noting is that Roku is the leading operating system for streaming TV, which has become the most prevalent form of TV. Moreover, streaming TV continues to grow rapidly.Roku has faced a number of challenges in recent years. Specifically, the TV ad market has weakened amid recession fears and supply chain issues have hindered Roku’s ability to procure enough of its set-top boxes to meet demand.But, as I’ve stated in previous columns, I think that worries about a recession are far overdone, and a number of well-regarded economists, including Ed Yardeni and Jeremy Siegel, have expressed similar views. As marketers become less nervous about the economy later this year, TV ad spending should surge. Meanwhile, supply chains are improving. And after the recent retreat of ROKU stock, the shares traded at a very attractive trailing price-sales ratio of 2.75.PubMatic (PUBM)The company sign is seen at the headquarters of PubMatic, an American digital advertising technology company for premium content creators.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comLike Roku, PubMatic (NASDAQ:PUBM) should get a big boost from accelerating advertising growth amid brightening views about the economy later this year. Last quarter, PubMatic’s total top line inched down 1.7% year-over-year to $74.3 million. But it remained profitable, as its net cash from operating activities came in at $19.4 million.There were other, very encouraging signs within its Q4 and 2022 results. Specifically, its “Revenue from the omnichannel video” climbed 25% year-over-year last quarter, while its “Net dollar-based retention was 108% for the year,” indicating that its customers are very happy with its products.“Our business model is unique with respect to our ability to consistently generate cash and maintain 30% plus annual adjusted EBITDA margins while also investing in future growth opportunities,” CEO Rajeev Goel said on the company’s Q4 earnings conference call, held on Feb. 28.PUBM’s trailing price-earnings ratio is a very attractive 27., given its strong, long-0term growth outlook. Given its strong, positive, long-term catalysts, PUBM is one of the best technology stocks to buy at this point.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of PUBM, GE, and ICAD.

This is helping Simon Property Group and Federal Realty start to recover as well as owners and operators of these types of retail properties.Simon Property Group is the largest mall operator in the United States and internatinally with Federal Realty managing, developing, and re-developing shopping centers and mixed-use properties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic U.S., Florida, and California.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; RecoveryLooking at this year’s continued post-pandemic recovery, Simon Property Group’s fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to be up 1% and rise another 2% in FY24 at $12.27 per share. Earnings estimate revisions are slightly down over the last quarter.On the top line, sales are forecasted to be up 3% in FY23 and rise another 2% in FY24 to $5.56 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would only be 3% below 2019 sales of $5.75 billion as the company continues to move closer to pre-pandemic levels. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Federal Realty, earnings are expected to edge up 2% this year and pop 4% in FY24 at $6.70 per share. Even better, earnings estimates have trended higher throughout the quarter.Sales are projected to jump 5% in FY23 and rise another 4% in FY24 to $1.18 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent 26% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $936 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; ValuationSimon Property Group and Federal Realty stock have given back any year-to-date gains after the most recent selloff among the broader financial sector. Simon Property Group is now down -7% year to date near Federal Realty’s -6% with both underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s +2% and the REIT Equity Trust – Retail Markets -1%.Story continuesHowever, over the last three years, shares of SPG are up +85% to beat the S&amp;P 500 and its Zack Subindustry’s + 28% although FRT’s +3% has lagged.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors are hoping the recent market volatility created buying opportunities and both stocks can resume what had been strong performances to start 2023.Looking at the valuation of both companies this certainly seems plausible. Simon Property Group stock trades at just 9.1X forward earnings which is nicely below its decade high of 20.9X, the median of 14.3X, and the industry average of 12X.In comparison, Federal Realty stock trades above the industry average at 15X but still below its own decade-long high of 29.8X and median of 22X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividendsSimon Property Group and Federal Realty’s dividends could make up for the recent volatility and reward patient investors. In this regard, SPG’s 6.5% yield tops FTR’s 4.4% and the industry average of 4.7% but both are well above the S&amp;P 500’s 1.6% average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayAt the moment, Federal Realty stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with earnings estimates revisions trending higher with Simon Property Group landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Simon Property Group’s earnings estimates have slightly declined, its valuation and steady top and bottom-line recovery is intruiging and investors may be rewarded for holding shares at their current levels.In terms of  post pandemic recovery and growth, Federal Realty’s stock is starting to become attractive which also makes the recent selloff among shares of FRT look like a buying opportunity with investors hoping both stocks can get back to their impressive starts at the beginning of the year.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

273,ef626768-dc67-397b-85e1-f2a1ed609d54,FRT,2023-03-18,5 Reasons to Add Federal Realty (FRT) Stock to Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-add-federal-realty-154303537.html,1679067783,STORY,['FRT'],"[Adding Federal Realty FRT to your portfolio seems a wise idea, given the strength of its fundamentals and solid prospects.The increase in consumers’ preference for in-person shopping experiences, following the pandemic downtime, has been driving the recovery in the retail real estate industry. Given this backdrop, this retail real estate investment trust (“REIT”) is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of premium assets in the United States.Last month, Federal Realty reported fourth-quarter 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.58, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57. This also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $1.47.Results reflected healthy leasing activity and better-than-anticipated revenues. Quarterly revenues of $280.1 million topped the consensus mark of $276.3 million and improved 10.2% from the year-ago quarter. For the fourth quarter, FRT generated comparable property operating income growth of 5.4%. This retail REIT provided an upbeat outlook for 2023.For 2023, FRT estimates FFO per share of $6.38-$6.58.While shares of FRT have declined 5.8% so far in the quarter compared with the industry's dip of 1.5%, the recent estimate revision trend indicates that analysts are bullish on this stock. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 FFO per share has moved 1.1% upward to $ 6.45. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The current price indicates a good entry point and FRT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Factors That Federal Realty a Solid PickSuperior Property Location and Diversified Tenant Base: Federal Realty’s portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, DC, to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — along with a diverse tenant base, both national and local, positions it well for decent growth.The company has strategically selected the first ring suburbs of nine major metropolitan markets. Due to the strong demographics and infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. A well-diversified tenant base of retailers minimizes the risks related to any particular retail industry and assures a stable source of rental revenues.Expansion, Development and Redevelopment Efforts: Federal Realty has been capitalizing on expansion opportunities in premium markets, which leads to income growth and creates long-term value. In 2022, it acquired properties worth $443.1 million. Moreover, as of the fourth-quarter end, throughout the portfolio, Federal Realty has redevelopment projects underway, with a projected total cost of $228 million, which it expects to stabilize over the next several years. Also, this retail REIT has ongoing improvements at 25 properties to better position the assets to capture a disproportionate amount of retail demand post-pandemic. Such efforts bode well for the company’s long-term growth.Mixed-Use Focus: Federal Realty is exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps catch the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area. Per its latest Investor Presentation, the company had $500 million of mixed-use expansion projects underway located in the first ring suburbs of major metropolitan markets with significant growth drivers. This augurs well for long-term growth.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash Flow Strength: Federal Realty focuses on maintaining a decent balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. The company exited 2022 with $1.3 million of total liquidity comprising cash and full capacity on its $1.25 billion credit facility.FRT’s current cash flow growth is projected at 27.04% compared with 14.01% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (“ROE”) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 14.06% compares favorably with the industry’s 6.01%, reflecting that FRT is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers. Given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities.Dividend: Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and Federal Realty remains committed to that. Concurrent with the second-quarter 2022 earnings release, Federal Realty announced a hike in its regular quarterly cash dividend to $1.08 and has maintained its payment thereafter. The new dividend indicated an annual rate of $4.32 per share.The company has paid out uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962, and the latest hike marked the 55th consecutive year of common dividend increases by the company. Also, it has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, which is encouraging. Given the company’s solid operating platform, opportunities for growth and decent financial position compared with the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. UBA, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Essential Properties Realty’s 2023 FFO per share has been revised a cent upward over the past month to $1.64.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Urstadt Biddle Properties’ ongoing year’s FFO per share has been revised 2.6% upward over the past week to $1.60.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A question to answer is whether Sherwin-Williams' current trading price of US$220 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Sherwin-Williams’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams What's The Opportunity In Sherwin-Williams?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 4.12% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Sherwin-Williams today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $211.63, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Sherwin-Williams’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Sherwin-Williams generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Sherwin-Williams' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 34%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SHW’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SHW, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Sherwin-Williams, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Sherwin-Williams (including 1 which is a bit concerning).If you are no longer interested in Sherwin-Williams, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy for 2023. Jonathan Barratt, the CEO of CelsiusPro, suggests that investors should purchase copper during a downturn when there is a chance to do so. Referring to a shortage of resources and a significant requirement for copper in the renewable energy sector, Barratt told CNBC on March 2: “Our outlook for 2023 and 2024 is: when you get a dip in copper prices, it’s something to have in your portfolio. There is just not enough supply. And when we look at everything that’s happening in the environmental space, the renewables, everything, copper is a key component. So that’s a buy on dip at any chance you get.”Moody's Investors Service has revised its worldwide outlook for Metals &amp; Mining from negative to stable due to a slight improvement in business conditions in the US and Europe. Additionally, China's reopening of the economy has boosted demand for base metals, steel, and coal, further supporting this shift in outlook. Moody's stated that there are indications of an increase in demand for base metals, and their prices are being supported by limited inventories. The price of aluminum is expected to remain above the average historical level until early 2024 due to various factors, including its growing role in clean energy. Copper's prices will be supported by historically low inventories and ongoing industry supply disruptions. While nickel is expected to have a surplus in 2023, the electric vehicle market's gradual growth in demand will result in supply deficits. Finally, zinc prices will be supported by limited supply, low inventories, and high energy costs, which will push out high-cost producers.The copper industry is trying to become greener. The largest copper producers in the world have announced their plan to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. This initiative is aimed at attracting investment funds that prioritize environmental concerns. The International Copper Association (ICA) has projected a doubling of copper demand from 2020 levels to 50 million tonnes by 2050. Thus, it has set targets for its members to decrease their direct and indirect emissions by 30% to 40% by 2030, 70% to 80% by 2040, and ultimately reaching zero by 2050. The process of producing copper from scrap metal usually involves the use of electricity, making it a more straightforward process to reduce carbon emissions.Story continuesOn March 16, the European Union introduced legislation aimed at increasing the supply of metals critical to the energy transition, including copper and nickel, by categorizing them as critical raw materials. This move highlights the increasing political concerns regarding the long-term availability of these metals, as the rising demand for them due to global decarbonization efforts continues. Copper, which is one of the largest markets for industrial metals, was not included in the European Union's previous list of critical raw materials released in 2020. Due to its varied uses in manufacturing, construction, and industrial operations, it is widely considered a barometer of global economic activity. However, concerns are rising about potential deep shortages in the future due to its surging usage in electric vehicles and renewable energy. According to the CEO of Glencore Plc, Gary Nagle, copper production will need to nearly triple by 2040 to meet the targets for net-zero carbon emissions. This increase in demand is expected to cause a 15% surge in copper prices, pushing them above $10,000 per ton, where they will likely remain.To benefit from the boom in the copper industry, some of the best copper stocks to buy this year include Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). Our Methodology For this article, we selected copper stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”     Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023.    Suggested articles:13 Best Asian Stocks to Buy Now13 Best Depressed Stocks To Buy Now15 Best US Stocks for Foreigners Disclosure: None. 10 Best Copper Stocks To Buy For 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals managed to grow its earnings per share at 29% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward.

REGN have gained 9.3% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 15.2%.Last month, the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results even though lead drug Eylea (aflibercept) sales declined as Dupixent maintained its stellar performance, with progress on launches in pediatric atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.Eylea sales were negatively impacted by a short-term shift to off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab), a temporary closing in the fourth quarter of 2022 of a not-for-profit fund that provides patient co-pay assistance and an increase in sales-related deductions. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that Regeneron co-developed Eylea with the HealthCare unit of Bayer AG BAYRY. Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States and Bayer records net product sales of Eylea outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.While management believes that it has substantially recovered from the issue encountered in the fourth quarter, it continues to expect competitive pressures for Eylea.The Eylea injection was recently approved to treat preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity.Regeneron is now focused on the potential launch of aflibercept 8mg following a tentative approval. In February 2023, FDA accepted for Priority Review the biologics license application for aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy.

Dupixent maintains its dominant position in atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyps, and has been approved in new indications, geographies and younger populations. Dupixent was recently approved by the European Commission to treat adults with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Meanwhile, Regeneron is looking to diversify in the lucrative oncology space with Libtayo (cemiplimab-rwlc), indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use has adopted a positive opinion for Libtayo in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with ≥1% PD-L1 expression.Hence, Regeneron should maintain its solid performance in 2023 as well.However, stiff competition from the potential entry of generics and new treatment options weighs on Eylea.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Cisco Systems' (NASDAQ:CSCO) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cisco Systems is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$14b ÷ (US$96b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).Therefore, Cisco Systems has an ROCE of 21%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Communications industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems roceIn the above chart we have measured Cisco Systems' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Cisco Systems here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEYou'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Cisco Systems. The figures show that over the last five years, returns on capital have grown by 58%. That's a very favorable trend because this means that the company is earning more per dollar of capital that's being employed. In regards to capital employed, Cisco Systems appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 29% less capital to run its operation. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Cisco Systems' ROCEIn a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Cisco Systems has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. Considering the stock has delivered 38% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet.
