Not only should the insurance industry be prepared to experience total insured losses from natural catastrophes well in excess of $100 billion every year, but annual losses greater than $200 billion are also plausible. These values are up significantly over the decade, according to the 2023 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses Report published by Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK).“The growth in exposure values, driven primarily by continued construction in high-hazard areas, and rising replacement costs - largely due to inflation - are the most significant factors responsible for increasing catastrophe losses,” said Bill Churney, president of Verisk extreme event solutions. “The other significant factor is the impact of climate change, which is often cited as the primary reason for the increase in losses. But, while this plays a role, year-over-year growth of exposure and rising replacement values have a far greater short-term impact.”No longer just hurricanes and earthquakes, thunderstorms responsible for 70 percent of insured losses Losses from the hazards beyond the traditional peak perils of hurricanes and earthquakes, including flood, severe thunderstorm, and wildfire, now account for a much larger proportion of the overall annual losses, due to the combination of more frequent events and more valuable properties at risk.Severe thunderstorms have been responsible for a growing proportion of the losses over the last five years and can no longer be considered a “secondary peril”.  So far in 2023, severe thunderstorms have accounted for more than 70 percent of insured losses with eight multi-billion-dollar events and according to this year’s report, the contribution to the Global Average Annual Loss (AAL) insured from severe thunderstorms globally is nearly 40 percent. U.S. severe thunderstorms are the majority of these losses, and alone make up 21 percent of the total global AAL.Story continuesEconomic losses could exceed $400 billion, highlighting a global protection gap  Verisk has determined that the global insured losses only make up approximately a third of global economic losses. The company estimates that annual economic losses could exceed $400 billion, a staggering figure that highlights the insurance protection gap that exists around the world.The sizable difference between insured and economic losses—the protection gap—represents the cost of catastrophes to society. On a regional basis, the percentage of economic loss from natural disasters that is insured varies considerably. In North America, for example, about 51 percent of the economic loss from natural disasters is insured, while in Asia, insured losses account for only about 12 percent of economic losses, respectively, reflecting the very low insurance penetration in these regions.The Verisk AAL is generally the sum of losses that can be expected, on average, every year. The global exceedance probability curve generated by Verisk’s suite of models provides probabilities on many different levels of loss, with significantly higher losses expected to occur with relatively high frequencies. According to the year’s report, Verisk estimates the global insured 1 percent, or 100-year loss is $370B. With this information, companies can prepare for large loss years and truly own their risk with confidence so that they can help weather these challenging years without risking their solvency.Churney continued, “Probabilistic catastrophe modeling remains the best approach for understanding risk and (re)insurers can use these models, with current exposure information, to put recent losses in perspective, while accounting for the impacts of continued exposure growth, climate change, and the increased role of perils beyond tropical cyclones and earthquakes.”Download the 2023 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses report here.###About Verisk Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK) is a leading strategic data analytics and technology partner to the global insurance industry.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the financial implications of a gray divorce, go to 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Divorcing Over 50. Financial Implications of a Gray DivorceThe ever-evolving complexities of modern life are reshaping the narrative surrounding how older individuals navigate the journey of aging. Many of these adults are now reconsidering their ""happily ever after,"" wishing to make the most of the time they have left. Moreover, attitudes in people over 50 are increasingly shifting in support of divorces, highlights a study published in 2020 in the Journal of Family Issues.This demographic trend of rising divorce rates in couples over 50, known as gray divorce or silver splitting, is rising and turning into a revolution. Susan Brown, professor of sociology and director of the Center for Family and Demographic Research at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, notes that 36% of people getting divorced are 50 years or older. As of April 2021, the US Census Bureau notes that 34.9% of people who got a divorce in the previous calendar year were aged 55 and above. The question is, why are couples aged over 50 increasingly being inclined towards a divorce?Susan Myers, a divorce attorney in Houston with decades of experience, notes that there are plenty of reasons why her clients call it quits, as reported by CNN.“I had one client tell me, ‘I do not want to die next to that man – I’m out”.Many clients well off in their 80s believe that the rest of their lives that they have left is too precious to be spent with the wrong person. Yet others have suffered abuse, drifted apart, or even discovered shocking misdemeanors about their partners. As such, the grim picture of getting divorced after 50 often involves navigating complex financial and emotional challenges, as couples confront the realities of late-life separation.Financial consultants such as those by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) can help couples who are divorcing to adjust their financial plan and fine-tune investments to stay on track. As stated by Kiplinger, the longer a couple has stayed together in marriage, the more assets they have acquired over the years, and the more expensive their divorce procedure is going to be.Story continuesCouples can spend a crazy $200,000 or more in legal fees while fighting for real estate worth millions of dollars. An amicable divorce can cost a couple anywhere between $25,000 to $50,000 on average. Moreover, gray divorces are financially devastating for both men and women, affecting the latter more than the former. Brown, also the co-director of the National Center for Family &amp; Marriage Research, reports that the standard of living for older women who divorce declines by a whopping 45%, compared to a 21% decline faced by older men. This implies that surviving divorce after 50 as a man is much easier than it is for a woman.Women also suffer because historically, they have been earning much less than what men earn. CiCi Van Tine, a divorce attorney with Davis Malm &amp; D'Agostine in Boston, notes how""Divorce is a financially devastating situation -- 50% of the assets, 50% of the income. It's just math,""As a result, women fall into poverty because they haven't worked all their lives due to maternal duties or simply living as a housewife. Bowling Green researchers further note that such women can count on less than $14,000 per year in Social Security. Thankfully, there are many places where individuals can live on social security only.Retirement Savings and Social SecurityCouples who are married for 10 years or longer can claim social security benefits from their ex-spouse. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) notes that the law controls such handling of social security benefits and is rarely open to interpretation.It further notes that if the couple was married for at least 10 years before splitting, the ex-spouse could apply for monthly benefits worth up to 50% of the higher earner's full retirement age benefit. (If the lower earner remarries, however, he or she forgoes any claim to such benefits in most cases).Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) also notes that if couples do not have sufficient assets accumulated in order to live comfortably late in life, they will, in turn have a difficult time building an adequate retirement portfolio. Expenses such as long-term care are high on one’s priority list, which should be duly accounted for. As such, it is important to understand the value of assets and retirement accounts and their potential tax implications. Such clarity can allow individuals to be clear in the next phase of their life following a divorce.Since the financial stakes for couples who divorce after 50 years of marriage are high, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) advises that individuals must seek advice and guidance from a financial advisor who can help them get a financially secure life. There are many financial challenges that may arise, such as increased retirement spending thanks to their newly found freedom, inflation, and factors such as alimony and even taxes.Moreover, many alternatives to divorce for older couples are offered. Some of these include annulment, separation, conscious uncoupling, and mediation. These alternatives can help couples understand the financial and emotional implications associated with going through a divorce.13 Mistakes to Avoid When Divorcing Over 50Photographee.eu/Shutterstock.comMethodologyIn order to compile the list of 13 mistakes to avoid when divorcing over 50, we have gathered information from financial service companies such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), along with financial websites and media companies like Yahoo Finance, Investopedia, and Forbes, amongst others.A consensus approach was used to gather and score mistakes. Each time a source recommended a mistake, it was awarded by a point. Finally, they have been ranked from the lowest to the highest scores.Without further ado, here are the 13 mistakes to avoid when divorcing over 50:13. Forgetting about health insuranceInsider Monkey Score: 10Forgetting health insurance can leave you without coverage, strain your finances, and deplete your retirement funds. Having no insurance will also result in limited access to care. Moreover, obtaining coverage will be more challenging and expensive, especially if you develop health issues after losing insurance. This is one major mistake to avoid when divorcing over 50.A partner who was previously covered by their spouse-provided insurance plan will have the right to continue coverage for a set period after the divorce, likely at a higher cost. This coverage called COBRA, may be expensive but is also negotiable. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to related deadlines. Other options that an individual can pursue include employer insurance or signing up for the state's healthcare exchange under the Affordable Care Act.12. Maintaining ownership of the former residenceInsider Monkey Score: 10Holding onto the house may not be the wisest thing to do after a divorce. Doing so will possibly preclude other important needs and finances, such as a sound retirement plan. In addition to expenses such as taxes and mortgage, keeping the house also involves unexpected overheads related to upkeep and replacement. This is especially true for a house that has been lived in for more than two decades, possibly for a couple going through a gray divorce. Therefore, it is best to talk to a financial advisor about the responsibilities and implications of owning the house.11. Disregarding potential tax implicationsInsider Monkey Score: 11Every financial decision made during a divorce has tax implications, and you’re likely to face legal and financial consequences if you don't avoid this financial mistake when divorcing over 50. For instance, if a couple divides their assets without considering their tax consequences, they may face unexpected capital gains taxes or other tax liabilities and penalties. On the other hand, failing to optimize tax allocation may also mean losing out on certain valuable tax benefits, such as credits, deductions, and exemptions offered to divorced individuals. Moreover, disregarding tax implications may also impact the value of your retirement assets and impact your ability to live a comfortable retirement.10. Skipping asset inventoryInsider Monkey Score: 12Retirement plan assets are usually marital property, implying their division between the divorcing parties. They include individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans, and defined benefit plans as well. For a married couple, one partner is usually more aware of the value of their assets, cash available in their savings accounts, and other details. If you're unaware of these details, it is best to have an inventory of all assets for your financial well-being. If you don't avoid this mistake when divorcing over 50, it may lead to tax implications, impact your credit score, and even result in legal issues.9. Lacking an advisory teamInsider Monkey Score: 13A team of financial and professional advisors can be the most valuable asset during a divorce. In particular, an attorney, a financial advisor, and a tax consultant are optimal to help you make the right decisions around your divorce. Lacking an advisory team will result in uneven distribution of property, unexpected tax liabilities, tax compliance issues, and even impact your retirement plans. Financial companies such as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) can provide couples with financial advice during this difficult period.8. Misunderstanding divorce cost-sharingInsider Monkey Score: 14Understandably, you want to go through a divorce as quickly as possible, but overlooking or having miscommunication regarding cost-sharing can result in an uneven distribution of financial responsibility. It might also lead to disputes and conflicts between the spouses and prolong the divorce proceedings along the way. Furthermore, since divorce in late life requires careful financial planning, such misunderstandings will only negatively impact your retirement savings and goals.7. Not Realizing joint debt liabilitiesInsider Monkey Score: 15Disregarding joint debt liabilities is a big mistake to avoid when divorcing over 50, which can result in unnecessary financial strain, credit damage, financial stress, legal consequences, and, in extreme cases, seizure of assets. Your credit score will be impacted in case of non-payment, and there may be legal disputes and potential court actions as well.6. Underestimating a future pension’s valueInsider Monkey Score: 16Overlooking the value of a future pension can result in inadequate savings for retirement and additional retirement accounts and render you limited financial flexibility to meet unexpected finances along the way. Even worse, you may even have to delay your retirement if you realize later in life that your pension is insufficient to allow a comfortable retirement. The Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts (IDFA) suggests the nonemployee spouse to receive their share of a future benefit, present valuing the pension and offsetting it, or both.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Divorcing Over 50.

Dividends can form an important source of income for investors and are often more dependable than volatile markets where share prices can abruptly rise and fall. Taking sizable positions in high-paying dividend stocks provides peace of mind to investors who can sit back and enjoy regular and consistent payments.Dividends can also be reinvested, helping to grow a portfolio over time without the need to sell any positions. High yield dividends can sometimes be a sign of underlying problems with a company’s stock. And many mature and successful companies provide their shareholders with strong dividend payments. Look at these top recommendations for three dividend stocks to buy and hold until you reach your more mature years.Bank of America (BAC)A photo of the Bank of America (BAC) logo in neon red and blue on a tan wall.Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comBank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) stock is safe, reliable, and offers a quarterly dividend that yields a healthy 3.35%. The spring crisis that emerged among regional lenders, such as Silicon Valley Bank, has contributed to BAC appearing cheaper right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBank of America’s shares are down 14% since this year’s start and trading at a 52-week low. Also stock is changing hands at eight times future earnings, indicating that the stock is undervalued at current levels.This presents a great opportunity to scoop up BAC stock before it inevitably rises once sentiment towards the banking sector improves. The most recent earnings report from the country’s second largest lender, was typically good. The bank announced earnings per share (EPS) of 88 cents and revenue of $25.33 billion, both of which topped Wall Street forecasts. In terms of the dividend, it pays 24 cents a share each quarter, and Bank of America just raised it by 9%.Dow Inc. (DOW)Detail of chemical plant, silos and pipesSource: ShutterstockAlthough riskier, investors who chase yields will likely be interested in chemical company Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW).Story continuesDow remains one of the three largest industrial chemical producers worldwide and a specialist in chemicals that are needed to make plastics and rubber. Dow Inc. provides its stockholders with a quarterly dividend payout of 70 cents, which is equal to a yield of 5.12%. This represents the second highest of any stock listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 3M (NYSE:MMM), which has a slightly higher yield of 5.61%.An older, more established industrial company (founded 1897), Dow Inc. is more of a slow-moving stock. So far in 2023, DOW stock has risen 7% versus an 18% gain in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Over five years, the stock has grown a modest 13%. Still, the share price remains in the green. The dividend is an attractive option for income investors. Also, Dow Inc.’s Q2 print was beyond expectations. Additionally, the company expects to generate free cash flow this year of $2.5 billion, meaning the dividend is likely secure moving ahead.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comWhile many people still associate Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) with its scientific calculators, the company is a major player in the design and manufacture of semiconductors and integrated circuits. In business since 1930, Texas Instruments is another mature and reliable company.It pays a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share, which gives it a yield of aproximately 3%. Considering that most tech stocks pay no dividend at all, Texas Instruments’ offering looks quite attractive. Importantly, the dividend does come at the expense of stock performance.TXN stock is up a slight 3% this year. Compare that to the 245% year-to-date (YTD) gain in fellow semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Thus, the dividend starts to look like a good way to keep shareholders from hitting the “sell” button. Over the past year, Texas Instruments’ performance looks better. TXN stock has increased 50% through five years and is up 342% over the past decade.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and BAC.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Nucor. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nucor?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nucor. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Nucor's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Nucor. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm is the second largest shareholder owning 10.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 8.8% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of NucorThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Nucor Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$247m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 20% stake in Nucor. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Nucor better, we need to consider many other factors.

(NYSE:TMO) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-thermo-fisher-110031459.html,1694170831,STORY,['TMO'],"[Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has had a rough week with its share price down 4.6%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:13% = US$5.7b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.13 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo start with, Thermo Fisher Scientific's ROE looks acceptable. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This probably goes some way in explaining Thermo Fisher Scientific's significant 20% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 21% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is TMO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TMO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 5.8% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (94%) of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Besides, Thermo Fisher Scientific has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 4.9% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Thermo Fisher Scientific's future ROE will rise to 20% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Hatfield said there will be no pay cuts for current employees.“Consistent starting pay results in consistent staffing and better customer service while also creating new opportunities for associates to gain new skills from experience across the store and lay the groundwork for their career regardless of where they start,” Hatfield said.Hatfield said it was difficult to move employees to different areas of the store to fill in staffing holes because of the salary differences. Cashiers and hosts generally have the lowest pay.The moves come as the U.S. job market is starting to loosen up bit. America’s employers added 187,000 jobs in August, evidence of a slowing but still-resilient labor market.Walmart Inc. announced in January that U.S. workers would get pay raises the following month, increasing starting wages to between $14 and $19 an hour. Starting wages currently ranged between $12 and $18 an hour, depending on location.]"

In the video, he went through a Facebook post from a customer who shared a receipt from a 2020 Walmart mobile order and another more recent one. Many of the items were the company’s Great Value house brand, and the receipts showed a 100% price increase on some products.“It’s sad/funny. I have doubled my income between 2013 and 2023, yet I’m struggling more than I was back then,” a shopper commented, reported Eat This, Not That. Some also accused Walmart of price gouging and encouraged other shoppers to go to Aldi or Costco instead to get better savings.According to Delish, Aldi is one of the cheapest grocery stores in the U.S. (Walmart wasn’t even on the list). Aldi claims 90% of its products are private-label brands, and the company’s business model is designed to minimize the cost to the consumer.But how do these two grocery rivals really compare?

Shares have lost about 4.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Under Armour due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Under Armour Q1 Earnings Top, Revenues Down Y/YUnder Armour delivered better-than-expected results in first-quarter fiscal 2024, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both the top and bottom lines fell year over year. However, the company reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2024.The company reported adjusted earnings of 2 cents a share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents per share. The company recorded earnings of 20 cents a share in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, net revenues of $1,317 million came ahead of the consensus estimate of $1,298 million but fell 2% on a year-over-year basis. The metric also slipped 1% on a currency-neutral basis.The company’s wholesale revenues decreased 6% year over year to $742 million, while direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues inched up 4% to $544 million due to a 6% rise in e-commerce revenues, which represented 40% of the total DTC business. Sturdy results in the e-commerce and retail channels aided the performance. It recorded 3% growth in owned and operated store revenues.Let’s Delve DeeperBy product category, Apparel revenues edged down 5% year over year to $824.7 million, while Footwear revenues increased 5% to $363.7 million. Revenues from the Accessories category inched up 1% to $97.9 million. Meanwhile, Licensing revenues tumbled 10.9% to $25.1 million, driven by softness in the Japanese licensee and North American unit.Net revenues from North America decreased 9.1% to $826.7 million. Meanwhile, revenues from the international business increased 12% (up 15% on a currency-neutral basis) to $485 million.Within the international business, net revenues in EMEA jumped 10.5% to $226.6 million (up 11% at constant currency), 14.5% in Asia-Pacific (up 21% at constant currency), and 12.7% in Latin America (up 5% at constant currency).The company’s gross margin shrunk 60 basis points to 46.1% from the prior-year period due to increased promotions and adverse foreign currency movements, partly offset by supply-chain gains associated with reduced freight expenses. Selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses dipped 1% to $587 million.The company’s operating income fell to $20.9 million from $34.5 million. The operating margin was 1.6%, down from 2.6% in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsUnder Armour ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of nearly $703.6 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $594.1 million and total stockholders' equity of $2,005.4 million. The inventory jumped 38% to $1.3 billion.For fiscal 2024, management expects capital expenditures in the range of $250-$270 million.GuidanceManagement reiterated view for fiscal 2024. For the current fiscal year, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects the gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points, compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, backed by supply-chain tailwinds with respect to lower freight costs. The figure is likely to be partly offset by mix impacts stemming from higher off-price revenues and increased promotions in the company's DTC business. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat to slightly up.Under Armour expects the operating income to be between $310 million and $330 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $284 million.UAA expects earnings in the band of 47-51 cents per share, down from 84 cents per share reported in fiscal 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share for the comparable baseline period. Capital expenditures are likely to come in the band of $250-$270 million.For the fiscal second quarter, revenues are likely to be flat to down slightly year over year, including a low single-digit fall in the company’s North American business. This will be partly offset by mid-single-digit increase in the international business. In addition, it anticipates the year's highest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Under Armour has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with EQR. Click here to check it out. EQR 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of EQREquity Residential Seems OvercookedHowever, the question looms: Is Equity Residential ('EQR') still undervalued after its latest surge?Understanding Equity Residential's Business ModelEquity Residential ('EQR') is an umbrella REIT, meaning its business model allows property owners to sell their units for a share in the REIT, providing owners with significant tax advantages.Furthermore, the REIT is vertically integrated, allowing it to streamline its income statement by acquiring, developing, and managing prime real estate.According to its latest publicly released data, Equity Residential ('EQR') owns 304 properties spanning over 80,000 units. Most of its assets are in high-productivity areas such as Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco, and Southern Carolina.Focus on Internal Rate of ReturnA noteworthy feature of the real estate investment trust is its focus on the internal rate of return instead of the capitalization rate. The prior refers to the annualized cash-on-cash return generated during an assets holding period, whereas the latter points to an asset's going-in annualized rental yield relative to the acquisition price.Many REITs get dragged into lucrative capitalization rates without considering the total returns. However, as shown by Equity Residential ('EQR')'s latest $135.3 million disposition in Los Angeles, which yielded an internal rate of return worth 8.7%, the fund emphasizes both value additivity and rental income.Story continuesEquity Residential's Capital StructureLastly, a salient feature of Equity Residential ('EQR') is its welcoming capital structure, which consists of 77.7% equity in the form of preferred and ordinary shares.Sure, the REIT has debt on its books. However, approximately 93% of the burden is fixed, contributing to a weighted average cost of 3.6% with an average maturity of 7.8 years.At face value, it can be said that Equity Residential ('EQR') can acquire throughout the interest rate cycle with relative ease as the REIT's capital structure conveys that little shortfall risk is present.Recent Acquisitions and DispositionsLet's delve into a few of Equity Residential ('EQR')'s latest acquisitions and dispositions.Equity Residential ('EQR') acquired two properties during its second quarter, with the first being a $78.6 fully-leased residential building in Atlanta, which has a going-in capitalization rate of 6.6%. Additionally, Equity Residential ('EQR') acquired a $108 million, 287-unit property in Denver at a going-in capitalization rate of 5%.Furthermore, and as alluded to earlier in the text, the fund recently disposed of $135.3 million worth of assets in Los Angeles. The assets generated an internal rate of return worth 8.7% and a going-out capitalization rate of 5.3%. More importantly, at 25 years of age, the assets were at risk of obsolescence, meaning the sale frees up capital for investments in higher productivity properties.Interim Results and Future GuidanceEquity Residential ('EQR') affirmed its third-quarter and full-year guidance on Wednesday, September 6th.According to the firm's management, rents will scale by approximately 5.5% to 6.25% by the firm's financial year-end, which aligns with the narrative shared in the fund's July earnings release.Furthermore, the company's August update showed that same-store rents ticked up by 3.5% in the first two months of the firm's third quarter, while occupancy rose to 96% from the 95.9% recorded in Equity Residential ('EQR')'s second quarter.Valuation and Dividend ProfileAlthough Equity Residential ('EQR') possesses robust fundamentals, its stock seems overvalued, and its dividend profile is relatively underwhelming.Firstly, the fund has a $3.77 to $3.83 funds from operations guidance for 2023. If an absolute valuation is utilized, whereby the sector average price-to-funds from operations of 12.23 is multiplied by Equity Residential ('EQR')'s midpoint FFO guidance, the resulting figure would show that the REIT is overvalued by approximately 37%.Furthermore, a relative valuation communicates that Equity Residential ('EQR')'s price-to-funds from operations ratio of 17.53 is within the 30th industry percentile, indicating further worry signs.Another worrying sign for Equity Residential ('EQR')'s common shareholders is the dividend yield. The REIT's forward dividend yield of 4.12% is less than half of the 8.29% its preferred shareholders earn. Moreover, Equity Residential ('EQR')'s dividend yield sits within the 19th industry percentile, suggesting better income-based real estate investment opportunities exist.ConclusionAlthough Equity Residential ('EQR')'s robust portfolio provides much reason for optimism, key metrics suggest its stock might be overvalued on an absolute basis. Moreover, at a dividend yield of less than half its preferred shares' distribution, it is worth questioning whether the vehicle is set to provide best-in-class returns to its common stockholders.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
24,ef2df66c-9295-3610-9f6c-7e9a4ce9b12e,EQR,2023-09-08,Apartment Rents Level Despite Healthy Demand & Supply Surge,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apartment-rents-level-despite-healthy-151300374.html,1694099580,STORY,"['AVB', 'EQR']","[The U.S. apartment rental market is currently experiencing a seismic shift. For the first time in decades, the growth in apartment rents is leveling rapidly, and there's even the possibility of negative growth on the horizon, per a recent RealPage report.What is intriguing is that this development is taking place at a time when demand is healthy and jobs are continued to be produced by the economy. The culprit seems to be the unprecedented surge in apartment construction, which is reshaping the dynamics of the rental market and tilting the balance of power toward renters.In August, on a year-over-year basis, same-store effective asking rents for new leases increased by a mere 0.28%, and this figure is poised to potentially slip into negative territory by September. Interestingly, while rent growth takes a breather, the demand for rental properties remains healthy, with occupancy rates stabilizing in the mid-94% range since January, aligning closely with long-term norms.This is happening because, with the influx of new supply into the market, renters have a plethora of choices, resulting in increased tenant turnover. However, to stay competitive and maintain occupancy rates and cash flow, property operators are giving up on prices.AvalonBay Communities AVB serves as a prime example of a company navigating this changing landscape successfully. Per its recent operating update, this residential REIT reported a 5.3% increase in same-store residential rental revenues for the two months ended Aug 31, 2023 compared with the prior-year period. This is roughly 40 basis points higher than the company’s most recent expectation on Jul 31, 2023. This demonstrates its adaptability in the face of market shifts.Physical occupancy for its same-store residential communities of 95.6% in August increased from 95.2% in the prior month. AvalonBay had recorded physical occupancy of 95.5% in the second quarter. However, the like-term effective rent change for same-store residential communities dropped to 3% in August from 3.9% in July. The figure also marked a decline from 4.9% in the second quarter.Equity Residential EQR, another prominent player in the industry, also seems to have weathered the changes with poise. The REIT concluded the leasing season with healthy demand and pricing for its apartment units. Also, the company said that its same-store revenue growth is on track with the guidance it issued during the second-quarter earnings release.Consistent with seasonal trends, rents peaked in early August, and the company anticipates rent moderation for the remainder of the year. Despite a 3.5% increase in same-store residential blended rates for the third quarter through Aug 31 compared to a 4.3% increase in the second quarter EQR reported an uptick in physical occupancy. Same-store physical occupancy increased to 96% in the same period from 95.9% in the prior quarter.Story continuesWhat Lies Ahead?Supply volumes are expected to remain elevated through 2024, and this is likely to put pressure on rents. However, residential REITs with well-positioned properties in strategic markets are expected to navigate through this environment efficiently, with demand remaining healthy. Moreover, amid financing issues and other challenges, new construction starts have tapered off in 2023. This suggests a significant reduction in supply by the latter half of 2025 and into 2026.In the short term, as supply remains elevated, renters may find themselves in a favorable position. However, market dynamics can change rapidly, and investors should keep a close eye on the evolving landscape to make informed decisions in this shifting market.Currently, AvalonBay and Equity Residential each carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

(Patrick Semansky/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Solomon made the argument in July that the worst was over, noting more ""risk-on sentiment"" that month. Other banks made the same point, predicting ""green shoots"" ahead.There was also plenty of caution from some CEOs who warned that it was too early to declare a turnaround. It remains that way inside some big banks.One equity markets banker at a major investment bank told Yahoo Finance that the IPO market in the US is ""still probably not going to get close to historical levels in 2023"" even after counting Arm and Instacart.Another concern, this banker said, is that if Arm ""doesn’t trade well people will be pretty concerned and it will have an impact on the broader market.""Jim Cooney, head of Americas equity capital markets for Bank of America (BAC), said there are 10-15 companies that investors and investment banks are expecting to go public between now and the end of the year.

The details of the program have not yet been reported.""The impact (of AI) will be very significant,"" potentially comparable to the advent of the internet, said Sal Cucchiara, Morgan Stanley's chief information officer of wealth and investment management, who is among the executives driving the bank's push into AI.Cucchiara, tasked with constantly scanning Silicon Valley for potential tech vendors, met OpenAI executives in 2022, before fast-growing app ChatGPT got mainstream usage.""It quickly became clear we needed to partner with them, they were far ahead of everybody else,"" he said.Andy Saperstein, Morgan Stanley's co-president and head of wealth management, then flew to California to discuss a partnership with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Boris Power, a technical staff member at the company.They signed a deal last summer in which Morgan Stanley has preferred access in product development for wealth management. Executives from the two companies celebrated over a dinner hosted by Saperstein, a candidate to become the bank's next CEO.Story continuesOpenAI declined to comment.While the bot will give insights and administrative support to financial advisers, investment advice will remain the purview of humans.""The adviser is still at the center,"" said Cucchiara. For now, employees view the technology as a helpful tool and aren't worried that they'll be replaced by bots, he said.WEALTH RACEThe AI initiative is part of Morgan Stanley's strategy to drive its wealth division, where net revenue surged 16% to a record in the second quarter and new client assets grew $90 billion.CEO James Gorman, who has spearheaded a series of major deals that funneled more money into the wealth business, aims to reach $10 trillion in assets under management.Morgan Stanley is not alone in its AI efforts. While banks already use AI to crunch numbers, detect fraud and analyze customer transactions, Wall Street giants are developing more sophisticated uses of generative AI that is capable of generating text, images and other data.JPMorgan Chase named Teresa Heitsenrether its chief data and analytics officer in June to lead AI adoption across the largest U.S. lender. Rival Bank of America's virtual assistant, Erica, has had more than a billion interactions with clients since it was introduced in 2018.Elsewhere, Moody's Analytics is also working with OpenAI and Microsoft to develop a research assistant that can be used by clients, said Nick Reed, its chief product officer.Large banks are the most advanced among financial firms in their adoption of AI, but asset managers, traders and insurers are also deploying it, said Michael Abbott, global banking lead at consulting firm Accenture.""We're beginning to see customer services led by artificial intelligence spread among the largest banks,"" said Abbott, who is working on hundreds of case studies with lenders looking to use AI.(Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer and Lananh Nguyen in New York; editing by Megan Davies and Nick Zieminski)]"

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders.

This major milestone makes the program among the largest residential customer demand response programs in the country.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)As California confronts climate change impacts including extreme heat events, demand response programs have become a critical and necessary tool for utilities to manage the grid to ensure reliability for their customers. Last year, the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's transmission grid, recorded an all-time peak load of 52,061 megawatts (MW) on a September day during a 10-day heat wave.The 100,000 enrollment milestone demonstrates the important role that energy customers can play in shifting energy load to help balance the grid. Device enrollments in the Uplight-run SmartAC™ Smart Thermostat program have tripled from this time last year, and load shift per device has also increased by 60% on average. More participants combined with more load shift per device significantly increases the level of support for the grid during high demand periods. In a recent event, the program achieved an estimated 40 MW of load shift, which will be verified at the end of the season. That's half the capacity of a typical 80 MW peaker plant and enough power for the instantaneous demand of 30,000 homes at once.""The scale of this program has become an important resource in managing demand and improving grid reliability for PG&amp;E customers,"" said Jake Zigelman, PG&amp;E's Senior Director of Load Management Solutions. ""It's a win-win for our customers and the grid, providing real incentives to participate while helping stabilize the grid during times of high demand.""Story continues""Grid resiliency is dependent upon strategic partnerships like the one between Uplight and PG&amp;E, enabling consumers to play an active role in decreasing strain on the grid and rewarding them for their efforts,"" said Luis D'Acosta, Uplight CEO. ""We are proud to contribute to this major milestone and the growing number of enrollments.""How SmartAC Smart Thermostat Program WorksSmartAC Smart Thermostat is a voluntary program for customers who can be flexible with their air conditioning (AC) load during periods of high demand when the grid may become stressed. When extreme heat strikes and PG&amp;E anticipates increased energy demand, the Smart Thermostat program automatically makes small changes to enrolled participants' energy use, shifting AC usage outside of the hours of high energy demand, while still maintaining comfortable home temperatures. During these demand response events, enrolled customers always maintain control of their comfort and may opt out of any event simply by changing the setpoint on their thermostat.Participants receive an incentive when they enroll with an existing smart thermostat, and significant discounts are also available for those who purchase a new, pre-enrolled thermostat through PG&amp;E's SmartAC marketplace, powered by Uplight. Discounts are applied at checkout through Uplight's demand response pre-enrollment feature, making the process simple and seamless. Participants still enrolled at the end of the program's season are eligible to receive an additional reward.Customers can still purchase a new smart thermostat, enroll in the SmartAC Smart Thermostat program, and participate in an event before California's summer season ends in late October. PG&amp;E electric service customers with at least one Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostat connected to central AC and Wi-Fi can enroll through the end of 2023.Visit PG&amp;E's SmartAC™ Thermostats page to learn more about the program.

An In-Depth Exploration,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pg-e-pcg-true-worth-163253594.html,1694104373,STORY,['PCG'],"[On September 07, 2023, PG&amp;E Corp (NYSE:PCG) reported a daily gain of 2.28% and a 3-month loss of -2.48%, with an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 0.91. However, the question remains: is the stock significantly overvalued? This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of PG&amp;E's valuation, offering insights to potential investors. Read on for a comprehensive examination.Introduction to PG&amp;E Corp (NYSE:PCG)Warning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with PCG. Click here to check it out. PCG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PCGPG&amp;E is a holding company whose primary subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric, is a regulated utility operating in Central and Northern California. The company serves 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers across 47 of the state's 58 counties. With a market cap of $42.10 billion and a stock price of $16.83 per share, PG&amp;E's valuation appears significantly overvalued compared to its fair value (GF Value) of $12.36.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally be traded at. If the stock price significantly exceeds the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on this analysis, PG&amp;E (NYSE:PCG) appears significantly overvalued. Given this overvaluation, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.PG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationFinancial Strength of PG&amp;EIt is crucial to assess a company's financial strength before investing in its stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. A good indicator of financial strength is the cash-to-debt ratio. Unfortunately, PG&amp;E's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01 is worse than 95.2% of 479 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This poor financial strength score of 3 out of 10 indicates that PG&amp;E's financial health is less than ideal.Story continuesPG&amp;E (PCG)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationProfitability and Growth of PG&amp;EInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially if the company has demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. PG&amp;E has been profitable 6 years over the past 10 years. However, its profitability ranks as fair, with an operating margin of 9.35%, worse than 57.26% of 496 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.One crucial factor in a company's valuation is its growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Unfortunately, PG&amp;E's average annual revenue growth of -32.1% ranks worse than 98.54% of 480 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another method to evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to finance its assets. If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders.

PCG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PCGPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 5/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 1/105. Momentum rank: 6/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned PG&amp;E Corp the GF Score of 53 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.PG&amp;E Corp Business OverviewPG&amp;E Corp is a holding company whose main subsidiary is Pacific Gas and Electric, a regulated utility operating in Central and Northern California. It serves 5.3 million electricity customers and 4.6 million gas customers in 47 of the state's 58 counties. PG&amp;E operated under bankruptcy court supervision between January 2019 and June 2020. In 2004, PG&amp;E sold its unregulated assets as part of an earlier postbankruptcy reorganization. The company has a market cap of $41.97 billion and reported sales of $22.26 billion. Its operating margin stands at 9.35%.Story continuesPG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0.89 positions it worse than 94.37% of 426 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.43, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years.The company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.35, which is worse than 89.82% of 452 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 8.18, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 83.03% of 436 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.Profitability AnalysisPG&amp;E Corp's low Profitability rank can also raise warning signals. PG&amp;E Corp's Operating Margin has declined over the past five years (-22.59%), as shown by the following data: 2018: 12.36; 2019: 7.83; 2020: 10.86; 2021: 10.37; 2022: 9.57.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where PG&amp;E Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -32.1 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 98.54% of 480 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, PG&amp;E Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.PG&amp;E Corp (PCG): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven PG&amp;E Corp's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a rich history and a significant market presence, its financial indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its performance in the future.

ALGN recently introduced a new SmartForce feature, attachment-free aligner activation. The new SmartForce attachment-free aligner activation feature, which builds on Align Technology’s foundational biomechanics for clear aligners and its database of Invisalign patients, is expected to aid in minimizing the number of attachments while maintaining predictable treatment outcomes.The new SmartForce attachment-free aligner activation feature is the latest of Align Technology’s many biomechanical innovations that enhance experiences for patients in Invisalign treatment.The attachment-free aligner activation feature is built into the Align Digital Platform and is the newest innovation as part of the Align digital workflow. A related update to ClinCheck treatment planning will include Live Update for 3D Controls that includes an attachment-free aligner activation selection.The introduction of the latest feature is expected to significantly boost Align Technology’s Invisalign sales across the globe.Significance of the FeatureThe SmartForce features, which include optimized attachments that are small tooth-colored shapes attached to teeth, are designed to deliver precise forces when and where needed to achieve more predictable tooth movements. Double attachments are often needed on upper central (front) teeth to achieve desired mesiodistal root movements.Although optimized attachments are critical for successful Invisalign treatment, with this new release, certain movements are now likely to be achieved using a similar force system via aligner activation. This is expected to reduce the need for double attachments on the centrals. If an attachment is still needed for certain scenarios, aligner activation will be present with a single optimized root control attachment as with other teeth, such as canines and premolars.Per management, via the innovation, Align Technology is expected to address the needs of doctors and their patients without compromising Invisalign treatment outcomes. Management also added that in cases where attachments are still necessary to ensure the optimal force systems, a single optimized root control attachment with SmartForce aligner activation has been designed to achieve the same movement instead of the more visible double attachment.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global clear aligners market was valued at $3.8 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $32.4 billion by 2031 at a CAGR of 24%. Factors like the increase in the trend of cosmetic dentistry, the rising number of people going for dental aesthetics and the prevalence of malocclusion are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the introduction of the latest feature is likely to significantly solidify Align Technology’s foothold in the niche space.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Align Technology introduced the Invisalign Palatal Expander System, a modern and innovative direct 3D printed device based on a proprietary and patented technology.The same month, Align Technology introduced Plan Editor in ClinCheck treatment planning software, a new tool in the Align digital workflow built into the Align Digital Platform.Also, in September, Align Technology entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Cubicure GmbH. Per management, the acquisition of Cubicure will strengthen Align Technology’s existing intellectual property portfolio and know-how in direct 3D printing of appliances. Integration with Cubicure will also extend and scale Align Technology’s printing, materials and manufacturing capabilities for its 3D-printed product portfolio.Price PerformanceShares of Align Technology have gained 43.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 7.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 11.6% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Align Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

Apple has now lost about $200 billion in market capitalization since Monday, as Chinese officials are reportedly asking government employees to stop using the world's most popular phone.The move lower comes amid a shaky September for stocks and ahead of the iPhone 15 launch event slated for next Tuesday — when Apple fans will likely be treated to enhanced periscope zoom in its flagship Pro model, yet another new charging port (USB-C), and maybe even a new color or two.But the technical issue facing Apple right now isn't about the phones it makes or the services it sells. It's the company's stock chart.Only one month ago, shares of the world's most iconic stock did something brand new in the company's four-decade history. Apple stock notched a record high — only to be followed by a nasty selloff, the speed of which had never been matched.At the time, we noted that the weakness would likely persist at least a month based on historical precedent. Indeed, the stock mounted a valiant rally in the second half of August, but the drubbing over the last two days erased nearly all those gains, leaving the stock hovering near multi-month lows.With the big iPhone event only days away, analysts have soured on the stock — but largely not because of the latest news from Beijing on iPhone crackdowns.In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan managing director and sell-side tech trader Ron Adler reminded investors that Apple stock usually rallies leading up to its events, but then sells off.Apple Stock Historical Returns by Month — 1981 to 2022According to Yahoo Finance data going back to Apple's IPO over four decades ago, the stock indeed typically sees a rise in July and August. But it then tends to decline in September, which was already one of the stock's worst months long before the iPhone was launched.Story continuesMore recently, in 10 of the last 12 years, Apple stock delivered negative returns in September — consistently selling off after the iPhone launch.Optimists might correctly note that October is typically the best month for Apple according to the above chart. But this year is already playing out differently. That August bump never materialized, and JPMorgan's Adler is arguing that Apple stock is behaving uncharacteristically defensively.He notes that when AI stocks rallied this year, Apple lagged. It's also exhibiting countercyclical behavior, serving as a cash source for buyers of other stocks. To wit, Apple is up a respectable 35% this year, but that's a far cry from Nvidia's (NVDA) 210% or Meta Platforms' (META) 150% return.Bigger picture, Apple is now facing three quarters of declining year-over-year revenue growth, which is prompting Sanford Bernstein to compare Apple to another tech stalwart, IBM (IBM).""Apple between 2015 and 2023 has had strikingly similar pre-tax income and [earnings per share] growth as IBM did between 1997 and 2012,"" writes Bernstein. After peaking in 2013, IBM stock cratered 58% and has largely traded sideways since 2015.Bernstein has two takeaways from IBM that apply to the phone giant. First, ""revenue growth matters,"" so Apple will need to focus on its top line. Second, strong profit growth alone is unlikely to let Apple cling to a rich multiple that values the stock like a growth company.Adler at JPMorgan says that if the 2023 trends persist, investors may sell Apple stock after the iPhone event next week and plow the money into Meta, Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) — his team's top three picks.morning brief imageClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the US dessert industry and its emerging trends, you can go straight to the 5 Most Popular Desserts in America.Desserts are essential to the American lifestyle, showcased by the dessert industry's market size. As reported by Grand View Research, the US's frozen dessert market had a valuation of $31 billion as of 2021, with the market size expected to grow by a CAGR of 4.6% up until 2030. The global industry of the same, on the other hand, has a market value of $92 billion as of 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period of 2022-2030, according to Polaris Research. Globally speaking, the largest market for frozen desserts is located in North America, with Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) and General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) being some of the most prominent players in the industry. As consumers begin paying more attention to their health and wellness, the dessert industry has received a higher demand for both low-fat as well as gluten-free products. The need for clean-label products is pushing corporations to adopt innovative methods in an attempt to grow their consumer base. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) owns two of the biggest names in the US ice cream industry, Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Talenti. As occurrences of lactose intolerance grow, so does the demand for dairy-free products. In November of 2022, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) announced that it would be looking into the production of ice cream free from cow dairy. The company is now delving into dairy proteins made via a process known as precision fermentation in order to appeal to a larger segment of the population as well as keep up with changing market trends. The company also aims to reduce its carbon footprint through this process as a way to contribute to its broader goal of becoming net zero by 2039. Currently, its ice cream products contribute to 30% of the greenhouse gas emissions that Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is responsible for. The giant corporation also plans to expand its ice cream sales in the coming years, especially by focusing on already established brands like Ben &amp; Jerry’s. Story continuesGeneral Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) owns Häagen-Dazs, an ice cream brand revered not just in the US but worldwide. The corporation generated a revenue of $18.9 billion in 2022. General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) has also updated its product portfolio with many items that are ‘organic’ and contribute to the growing demands for simplicity in food products. They’re made from fewer and simpler ingredients yet attract a wide range of audience. Häagen-Dazs itself has made several innovations in trying to appeal to the growing demand for desserts as snacks, with the latest step being the introduction of butter cookie cones. The company has also moved into the yogurt aisle with the launch of yogurt products, ensuring they’re cashing in on all the latest market demands. Steps like these showcase that the company is trying to diversify its range and branch out from one product by offering some of the most popular desserts in America. Players like Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT) have also upturned the global dessert market, selling 1.63 billion doughnuts globally in 2022. In the first quarter of the year 2023, the company’s net revenue grew 12.5%. The US market is a massive contributor to the overall growth of Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT). The CEO mentioned that the company’s campaigns for special events like Valentine’s Day and St. Patrick’s Day, along with their specialty offerings, were the main drivers behind such a solid first quarter of the year. In addition, Baron Growth Fund has made some interesting comments about Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter:“We continued to increase our holdings in Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT), an omni-channel manufacturer and retailer of doughnuts. Krispy Kreme sells its product through its owned and franchised doughnut shops, in grocery and convenience stores through its Delivered Fresh Daily (DFD) network, and via e-commerce in U.S. and non-U.S. markets. The company also owns Insomnia Cookies, a digital-first brand specializing in cookies and focused on young consumers.Krispy Kreme is successfully executing its plan to grow fresh points of access by 10% to 15% annually. It now services over 12,000 points of access globally by leveraging 400 doughnut producing hubs worldwide. In its most recently reported quarter, the company grew revenue at 14.4% organically as it benefited from price increases and premium seasonal innovation, including strong Valentine’s and St. Patrick’s Day offerings. Krispy Kreme continued to expand its capabilities to offer specialty doughnuts across channels, with e-commerce a key beneficiary of this investment. We are encouraged by the results, with e-commerce revenue growing 23% year[1]over-year and now approaching 20% of total company sales.In the U.S., the company expanded its footprint in traditional DFD locations while also demonstrating its ability to execute on new growth opportunities. We are particularly excited by an expanded trial at McDonald’s in the Louisville, Kentucky area. The company was able to add over 160 McDonald’s locations serviced by three local hubs with no disruption to existing locations or sales in the area.Internationally, Krispy Kreme is on track to have a presence in up to seven new countries in 2023, with an additional three to five in 2024. The company’s total pipeline of new hubs and fresh shops from franchise partners now exceeds 1,000 shops, which will be used to unlock additional points of access over the next five years. As the company continues to execute on its international expansion plan and domestic growth opportunities like the potential McDonald’s partnership, Krispy Kreme’s ability to expand from 12,000 points of access to 75,000 points of access should drive outsized top-line and EBITDA growth.”Desserts have made their way into every part of the food industry, instead of being limited to specific dessert chains. In the restaurant world, around 60% of operators claim that they have made desserts a regular part of their menu as a means to drive sales and generate further profits. Companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) sell a range of desserts alongside their regular menus in an attempt to offer the complete meal experience to their consumers. As the demand for desserts continues to heighten, along with an increased requirement for healthy alternatives, the dessert industry has multiple avenues to grow and innovate in the coming months of the year. Let's now head over to the list of the most popular desserts in America.20 Most Popular Desserts in AmericaPixabay / Public DomainOur MethodologyTo devise the rankings for the most popular American desserts, we have taken a consensus approach based on mentions on Reddit. The more times a dessert was mentioned by a Redditor, the higher it has been ranked on the list. Based on the number of mentions, each dessert has been given a score from 1-20. Based on this factor, here is the list of the 20 most popular desserts in America according to our analysis:Most Popular Desserts in the US:20. Fudge Score: 0114.24% of restaurants offer some form of fudge dessert on their menus. Some of the most popular pairings for the dessert are with cakes, ice creams, and sundaes, all using it in its melted form. This is also why the hot fudge sundae by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered such a popular dessert. 19. Moon PiesScore: 02Moon pies were originally invented in 1917 as a snack for coal miners and are mainly produced in Tennessee today. The Chattanooga Bakery is primarily responsible for the production of this snack-like dessert and often makes up to a million moon pies a day. 18. Candy BuckeyesScore: 03Buckeye candies are most popular in the state of Ohio, especially during the holidays and the football season. The heightened demand for snack desserts is what has led to the increase in popularity of bite-shaped desserts like these. The dessert is named so after Ohio’s state tree, the buckeye. 17.

75,65a2c0a5-eca1-35e2-b466-507ddd1927b4,ADM,2023-09-08,15 Largest Biodiesel Producers in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-largest-biodiesel-producers-world-103636345.html,1694169396,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article, we take a look at the 15 largest biodiesel producers in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis of the biodiesel industry and go directly to the 5 Largest Biodiesel Producers in the World.The need for alternative fuels has contributed massively to the growth of the biodiesel industry. In 2022, the industry had a market size of $36.48 billion, predicted to grow to $79.12 billion by 2032, showcasing a CAGR of 8.1%, according to Precedence Research. The fuel sector alone contributed 79% of the total revenue, demonstrating how the transportation industry has been revolutionized with the advent of biodiesel. Out of all the sources that go into the production of this compound, vegetable oils made up 96.4% in 2022. The market is only expected to grow from here as the demand for biofuels replaces conventional fossil fuels, which are constantly being advocated against by environmental activists, and rightfully so. Not only is this type of fuel biodegradable, but it is also much more compatible with modern engines, which has led to its increased demand, specifically in the transport industry. Half of the market’s growth can be attributed to the demand for fuels that emit lower greenhouse gases, whereas the other half can be credited to increased government incentives and subsidies. Even though the automotive industry is growing more accustomed to biodiesel, that does not mean that the industry isn’t facing challenges of its own. Currently, the biggest hurdle for the biodiesel industry turns out to be its cost. The production costs for biodiesel are mainly determined by the expenses for feedstock oils, which are highly volatile. Currently, biodiesel sells a whopping 130% more expensive than fossil fuels, which is a barrier that needs to be crossed. The way out seems to be through government subsidies, which are currently upholding the industry. The most significant opportunity for the biodiesel industry’s growth is the depletion of fossil fuels, for which there is no other alternative yet. That, paired with the environmental benefits of the fuel and its compatibility with modern engines, will contribute significantly to the market in the coming years. Story continuesGlobally speaking, the EU is collectively the largest consumer of the market, but country-wise, it is the US. Renewable Energy Group is currently the largest biodiesel producer in the US, with five plants producing 432 million gallons annually. The company generated a revenue of $3.6 billion in 2022. Renewable Energy Group Inc has its headquarters in Iowa, from where it operates ten production plants nationwide.Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) is another big corporation that has a long history of working with natural oils in the US and currently produces biodiesel from various vegetable oils. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) managed to raise $101.8 billion in revenue in 2022 alone. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co (NYSE:ADM) is further growing their biodiesel business and reported strong financial results in the subsector in the company's Q2, 2023 earnings call. The CEO, Juan Luciano, the CEO of ADM said the following: ""Biofuels demand continues to remain strong. Through the first half of the year, we saw robust margins from biodiesel, strong demand for ethanol and an increasing demand for vegetable oil from renewable green diesel and we expect this trends to continue in the second half. Our Spiritwood, North Dakota processing facilities is scheduled to start up in Q4, adding 1.5 million metric tons of annual soy crush capacity to our portfolio and producing low carbon intensity soybean oil for our JV partner Marathon’s nearby renewable diesel facility.""It’s players like these that have helped the US achieve its status as one of the biggest producers as well as consumers in the global biodiesel industry. The biodiesel industry's growth is not just limited to Western players; countries in the Asia-Pacific, like India, China, Thailand, and Indonesia, are also emerging as significant players, with Indonesia bagging first place in the list of the largest biodiesel producers in the world. 15 Largest Biodiesel Producers in the WorldKYTan/shutterstock.comMethodology To curate this list of the largest biodiesel producers in the world, we have compiled data from the United States Department of Agriculture: Foreign Agricultural Services, Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN), and Biodiesel Magazine. The rankings have been set based on the number of gallons the countries produced or were estimated to produce in the year 2022. For countries that did not have recent data available, data from 2017 was utilized. Based on these numbers, here is the list of the 15 largest biodiesel producers in the world currently: 15. India Biodiesel production in 2022: 48 million gallonsIndia comes in fifteenth place in this list of the largest biodiesel producers in the world, but its numbers are still impressive when compared with other countries in the region. As of the year 2021, the Indian government has claimed that it has a biofuel blending rate of 8.1%, which includes both biodiesel and ethanol. India is currently relying mainly on Jatropha for the production of biodiesel, which is low in yield as of yet. This is causing a significant hurdle that keeps biodiesel production in the country from going higher. 14. NetherlandsBiodiesel production in 2017: 105 million gallonsThe Netherlands has shown significant promise in terms of biodiesel production, with efforts coming in from both the government as well as the private sector. In 2022, Argent Energy, a biofuel producer, expanded its biodiesel production capacity in the Port of Netherlands. The promises set forth by the company were in line with the broader Dutch coalition agreement’s plans around clean mobility. 13. MalaysiaBiodiesel production in 2017: 124 million gallons One of the reasons why Malaysia isn’t reaching a higher place when it comes to the largest biodiesel producers in the world is because it’s not fully utilizing the capacity that it has. In 2022, the country had a total of 22 biodiesel plants, but only 19 were in operation. The 22 plants had a combined capacity of 3,044,583 tons per year, but due to the non-usage of three of these plants, only 998,862 tons were produced. 12. CanadaBiodiesel production in 2017: 132 million gallonsCanada was doing quite well for itself in 2017 in terms of biodiesel production, but the numbers have dwindled since then. The pandemic-related lockdowns of 2020 led to reduced use of transportation and, hence, a decrease in the demand for fuels. As the domestic market size dropped, so did production numbers immensely. This offset a downward chart for the country that it has not yet managed to recover from. 11. Colombia Biodiesel production in 2022: 184 million gallons (Estimated)Colombia is also one of the countries that have witnessed a decrease in their biodiesel production in 2022. This decrease resulted from adverse weather conditions and the government lowering the biodiesel blend mandate to B10. However, the numbers are expected to increase gradually in 2023, with the production capacity predicted to rise to 206 million gallons. This will bring about a slow improvement in the economy, which will be much appreciated after a year of decreased economic activity. 10. Poland Biodiesel production in 2017: 264 million gallonsRapeseed is the primary source of biodiesel production in Poland, which has been impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war. Due to the economic impacts of the conflict, rapeseed prices have increased, leading to an effect on the production of biodiesel. The production of biodiesel in the country has also led to the creation of competition between the national food, fodder, and petrol industries. It can be said that Poland's wider industrial environment is highly affected by the biodiesel industry. 9. ThailandBiodiesel production in 2022: 351 million gallons (Estimated)Thailand has had 13 biodiesel plants since the year 2020, which are producing more biodiesel than the country demands. The rest of the fuel is exported, with the estimated number for 2022 being 17 million gallons. The slow economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted Thailand’s biodiesel industry, with both production and consumption rates still dropping. 8. SpainBiodiesel production in 2022: 356 million gallons (Estimated)Spain is the third largest biodiesel producer in the EU and eighth on the list of the largest biodiesel producers in the whole world. According to the 2015 biofuel law, Spain’s consumption and sales mandate for biofuels is set to rise by 0.5% in 2023. Major industry players like Repsol are taking significant initiatives, such as setting up new plants, for a shift to advanced biofuels.7. FranceBiodiesel production in 2022: 544 million gallons (Estimated)France had already begun blending fuels in the early 2000s when many other countries were still behind on the concept. The demand has only kept increasing, with production capacity eventually rising higher than the required amount. Avril, the country’s largest producer of biodiesel, has launched biodiesel fuel specifically aimed at fleet trucks after its initial success with cars. 6. ArgentinaBiodiesel production in 2022: 554 million gallons (Estimated)Not far from France in the list of the largest biodiesel producers in the world, Argentina has increased its biodiesel mandate in an attempt to conserve foreign exchange. The country’s largest source of biodiesel is soybean oil, the supplies for which were expected to tighten as a result of the increased mandates. Increasing internal mandates will allow the country to achieve less reliance on fuel imports, which were quite significant up until 2022. Click to continue reading and see the 5 largest biodiesel producers in the world.Suggested Articles:11 Most Undervalued Biotech Stocks to Buy According to Analysts15 Largest Exporters of Refined Petroleum10 Best Fuel Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 15 largest biodiesel producers in the world is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

AGRO, Dole plc DOLE and Limoneira Co. LMNR.Industry: Agriculture OperationsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2145333/4-stocks-to-watch-as-the-agriculture-operations-industry-recoversThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is poised to benefit from innovations and improved consumer demand for healthy products. Investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and expansions are likely to fortify the prospects of the industry players. Continued investments in assets and technological capabilities to innovate and serve customers bode well for players like Archer Daniels Midland Company, Adecoagro S.A., Dole plc and Limoneira Co.However, higher investment costs and SG&amp;A expenses continue to mar the profitability of the companies participating in the industry. Logistic and supply-chain issues, higher input costs, and elevated operational expenses have been affecting industry players for a while. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressure have been affecting results.About the IndustryThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry comprises companies that produce or procure, transport, store, process, and distribute agricultural commodities to consumers. It also distributes ingredients to other parts of the agriculture industry (including clothing, animal feed, energy and industrial products). Some industry players engage in dairy operations, land transformation activities and the development of food ingredients using gene-editing technology.The industry encompasses production activities related to traditional farming of crops (like corn, soybean, wheat and cotton) and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy and eggs). The products are mainly sold at grocery stores or exported overseas. These are also used as feedstock for other industries. For example, cotton is used in the clothing industry and corn is used in the ethanol industry.Story continuesFactors Shaping the Future of Agriculture - Operations IndustryRobust Demand Trends for Organic Products: The industry has benefited from an organic movement prompted by consumers' increasing demand for healthier food. Agriculturists are adopting organic production techniques and curtailing the use of chemicals and pesticides. Innovations in food processing, improved grain-handling techniques, larger storage spaces and strong emerging market demand are conducive to the industry's growth.Healthy eating habits are likely to accelerate purchasing and consuming alternative proteins. Focus on nourishment and wellness is pushing microbiome solutions to the forefront. The companies have been investing in acquisitions and joint ventures to build top-notch ingredients and solutions for meeting the demand for healthy products.Agricultural Export Projections: Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, agricultural export projections for fiscal 2023 (ending Sep 30, 2023) of $177.5 billion suggest a decline of $3.5 billion from the May forecast of a record $181 billion. The export forecasts have been affected by declines in commodity groups, including corn, wheat, and tree nut exports. Moreover, the agricultural export projections for fiscal 2024 are estimated at $172 billion, reflecting a further decline from the revised estimate for fiscal 2023. Lower exports of soybeans, soybean meal, and dairy products are expected to hurt agricultural exports in fiscal 2024.Elevated Costs: Industry participants have been witnessing higher costs due to rising raw material, freight and logistics costs, including constraints in labor and trucking resources, leading to higher lead times for deliveries. Supply-chain concerns and commodity cost pressure have been affecting the profitability of agricultural companies for a while. The companies have resorted to pricing strategies to counter rising raw material costs. The industry participants seek to counter the global supply-chain challenges by forming partnerships and distribution strategies. Despite the pricing strategies, supply-chain challenges and cost inflation are expected to continue hurting margins in the near term.Companies in the industry continue to face raised SG&amp;A expenses due to higher performance-related compensation, project-related costs, commissions and variable compensation. The companies are also witnessing elevated costs for investments in technology and innovation to stay ahead of the race. Continued deleverage in SG&amp;A expenses may continue to have a bearing on the profitability of companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Agriculture – Operations industry is a 13-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

You can skip our analysis of the vegetable oil industry and read Top 8 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries in the World.Oils extracted from soybean, palm, canola, sunflower, olive, and coconut plants serve as a cornerstone in the agricultural economies of the top vegetable oil producing countries in the world. Historically, the twin titans of vegetable oil production have been Indonesia and Malaysia due to their dominance in palm oil cultivation. As of the last assessment, Malaysia and Indonesia own 85% of the world's palm oil output. Likewise, China, the US, and Brazil are the leading soybean oil producers. Currently, Malaysia is the largest exporter of vegetable oils, with the Netherlands and China as its primary importers. According to OEC, Malaysia's vegetable oil exports amounted to $1.63 billion in 2021, and the Netherlands imported vegetable oil valued at $499 million in the same year. Notably, in addition to their obvious culinary uses, vegetable oils are also employed in biodiesel production. According to Precedence Research, the biodiesel market was $36.48 billion in 2022, and 96.4% of its worldwide revenue originated from the vegetable oil feedstock category. We have previously discussed the 15 Most Consumed Edible Oils in the World; read our article to discover which oils are most in demand.Companies Focusing on Innovation in the Vegetable Oil IndustryThe vegetable oil industry was valued at $212.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% between 2022 and 2027, reaching $268.9 billion by 2027. As market dynamics shift, with an increasing emphasis on sustainability and healthier alternatives, companies are consistently innovating to optimize vegetable oil yield. For instance, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), a titan in the vegetable oil industry, specializes in edible oil sourcing, processing, and distribution. The company leads in vegetable oil innovation and has invested in a biodiesel-focused soybean crushing plant. The soybean plant aims to produce 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil, a portion of which will be utilized as renewable diesel feedstock.Story continuesBesides biodiesel, ADM-SIO, a subsidiary of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), has introduced sustainable personal care solutions derived from hydrogenated vegetable oils. A prevalent texturization agent in personal care products like soaps, lipsticks, and lotions is stearic acid; this agent traditionally comes from the hydrolysis of animal fat. However, a more sustainable method involves using hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as cottonseed, palm, olive, and sunflower oils. As a result, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) produces texturization agents from these hydrogenated vegetable oils for use in cosmetics and personal care items, offering a more eco-friendly alternative to those derived from animal fats. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is also among the vegan stocks billionaires are loading up on; the company currently has 12 billionaire investors and has invested $300 million to increase its production capacity to meet the rising demand for alternative proteins. As the company foresees a $125 billion market for alternative proteins by 2030, it plans to capitalize on it.Similarly, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) is refining its strategies for oilseed processing and oil extraction efficiency. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)'s venture into high-oleic oils is notable, addressing the increasing demand for healthier vegetable oil alternatives. High-oleic vegetable oils, which have a greater percentage of monounsaturated oleic acid than standard oils, possess an extended shelf life and are more cost-effective. The stability and skin-friendly attributes of high-oleic oils also make them a preferred choice for formulations in creams, lotions, and other cosmetic products.Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) and Viterra, a Glencore Plc-backed marketer and handler of grains and oilseeds, have recently entered into an agreement to form a combined global agribusiness solutions company. The agreement is based on a cash and stock transaction, and the merger aims to create an innovative agribusiness company to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets.As the union will increase both companies' market foothold, they plan to better manage seasonal cycles and supply chains. According to Bunge's announcement, Viterra shareholders will receive 65.6 million shares of Bunge stock, with an aggregate value of approximately $6.2 billion, along with $2.0 billion in cash. The terms represent a consideration mix of around 75% Bunge stock and 25% cash. Moreover, as part of the deal, Bunge Limited will assume $9.8 billion of Viterra's debt, which is associated with approximately $9.0 billion of highly liquid, readily marketable inventories.We have already done a detailed overview of the 12 Biggest Palm Oil Companies In The World; read this insightful piece to know this sector's central entities. Let’s now move towards the top vegetable oil producing countries. Top 20 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries In The WorldTop 20 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries In The WorldOur MethodologyWe identified the countries with the highest vegetable oil output using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN FAO) database. After shortlisting the top 20 vegetable oil producing countries, we obtained their oil production data for 2020, 2019, and 2018 from the UN FAO. We then averaged these annual production figures to determine these nations' standard vegetable oil yield.Based on our findings, here are the leading nations in the vegetable oil industry:20. The Philippines Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.35 million tons The Philippines has vast coconut plantations; naturally, it's a leading producer of coconut oil. In 2020, the country's largest share of vegetable oil production came from coconut oil (almost 0.96 million tons), followed by maize oil. The country's tropical climate and archipelagic geography provide an ideal environment for coconut cultivation. Beyond mere production, the Philippines has also invested in refining, marketing, and research to cement its position in coconut oil exports.19. Japan Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.61 million tons While Japan is not traditionally recognized as an agricultural powerhouse, it has a specialized niche in vegetable oil production. Canola (rapeseed) and soybean oils are predominant in the country and are deeply rooted in Japanese culinary traditions. Notably, the country employs advanced oil extraction and refining technologies to ensure consistent quality.18. Colombia Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.84 million tons Colombia's tropical climate and fertile plains are favorable for palm cultivation, and as a result, the country's annual palm oil production is close to 1 million tons. Other top vegetable oils in Colombia are palm kernel oil and soybean oil.17. Turkey Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.937 million tonsTurkey's dominance in the vegetable oil sector comes from its extensive sunflower and olive plantations. The country's diverse climates, ranging from Mediterranean to temperate, allow for the cultivation of various oil crops. The country’s most important vegetable oil is sunflower oil, with a production of over 1 million tons, followed by olive and cottonseed oils. Turkish producers emphasize tradition, especially in olive oil, and combine ancient practices with modern technology to position the country as a quality-driven producer in the global market.16. MexicoAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 1.96 million tons Mexico's vegetable oil industry leans heavily on its rich tradition of cultivating soybeans, coconuts, and safflowers. The country has also benefited from its strategic location and a diversified agricultural landscape that allows producers to experiment with new seed varieties. For instance, Mexican producers began growing canola around 2000 and have had success with its yield. Today, a significant share of Mexico’s total vegetable oil output comes from canola.15. NigeriaAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 2.04 million tons Nigeria is Africa's top palm oil producer, and the country's palm oil yield currently stands at 1.28 million tons. The Niger Delta region, characterized by its tropical climate, is particularly conducive to oil palm cultivation. Although the vegetable oil industry faced challenges in past decades, recent revitalization efforts by the government and stakeholders are steadily restoring Nigeria's position in the palm oil market. Besides palm oil, the country also boasts a significant yield of groundnut and soybean oil.14. France Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 2.49 million tons France's vegetable oil industry thrives on its agricultural landscape; notably, the country's agricultural production value is the highest in the EU. Rapeseed oil production in France amounts to 1.7 million tons, thanks to its vast rapeseed fields. French vegetable oil producers are renowned for maintaining high standards of quality and sustainability. Coupled with strong regulatory frameworks, France has consistently ranked among the top European vegetable oil producers.13. Spain Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 2.613 million tonsSpain and olive oil are synonymous, as the country ranks first among the countries that produce the best extra virgin olive oil. Also, according to the International Olive Council (IOC), Spain produces 40% of global olive oil. The Iberian Peninsula boasts extensive olive groves and benefits from a Mediterranean climate. Spain's dedication to quality assurance and appellation control guarantees its esteemed position in the global market.12. Thailand Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 3.61 million tons Thailand has a strong foothold in the vegetable oil industry because of its vast palm oil and coconut oil production. The country's tropical climate and extensive coastline create an ideal environment for these crops. According to the UN FAO, Thailand’s palm oil production reaches up to 2.6 million tons annually.11. Germany Average Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 4.41 million tons Germany produces close to 3.7 million tons of rapeseed (canola) oil each year, owing to its temperate climate and fertile soils. Moreover, the nation's agricultural infrastructure and emphasis on quality have helped it carve a niche in the global vegetable oil market.10. CanadaAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 4.71 million tons Canada is a global leader in canola oil production, and the country's current canola oil production stands at 4.4 million tons. While Canada also produces soybean, maize, and linseed oil, their yields are significantly lower than that of canola oil. The country’s impressive canola oil yield can be attributed to its cooler climate.9. IndiaAverage Annual Vegetable Oil Production: 6.004 million tonsIndia's agriculture is among the most diverse in the world, a result of its vast expanse. The nation produces significant amounts of cotton, canola, soybean, mustard, and coconut and naturally capitalizes on the oil from these seeds. According to the UN FAO, India’s primary vegetable oils are canola, soybean, and cottonseed oils. Systematic breeding programs have improved the quality of oils produced in the country, emphasizing purity and nutritional content.Click to continue reading Top 8 Vegetable Oil Producing Countries In The World.Suggested Articles:15 Most Consumed Crops in the World15 Worst Countries in the World for Vegetarians20 Countries With Highest Rates Of VegetariansDisclosure: None.

Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST and Keurig Dr Pepper KDP are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.What's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.

Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Soft drink companies have been gaining from improved demand trends, aiding volume growth. Due to recovery across markets, market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels have been boosting sales. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly lifted sales in recent quarters. The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher sales and operating expenses costs, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

86,aa184f5f-a943-317f-ae87-834d86da6d43,LUV,2023-09-08,Most Airline Stocks Hurt During Wednesday's Trading: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-airline-stocks-hurt-during-130800070.html,1694092080,STORY,"['LUV', 'UAL', 'ALK']","[It is no secret that air travel has bounced back very strongly from pandemic lows. Air travel continues to be particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand is also bouncing back nicely. Strong passenger volumes bode well for airline stocks.Despite the optimism, airline stocks failed to perform well during Wednesday’s trading. Shares of airline heavyweights like Southwest Airlines LUV and United Airlines UAL declined 2.6% and 0.3%, respectively, yesterday from Tuesday’s closing price. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index slid 1.4% at the close of trading on Sep 6.What Led to the Price Decline?It is well known that fuel expenses represent a significant input cost for the aviation space. Consequently, the recent uptick in oil prices does not bode well for airlines. United Airlines’ management stated in an SEC filing that “since mid-July 2023, jet fuel prices have climbed over 20%”.Oil prices have spiked following Saudi Arabia and Russia’s decisions to extend their voluntary production cuts to the end of the year. Moreover, the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes by the Fed has also supported the northward movement of oil prices. This is because higher interest rates generally tend to elevate costs and slow down the economy, which translates to less demand for oil.Following the increase in the oil price, UAL, Alaska Air Group ALK and LUV increased their fuel cost per gallon projections for the third quarter of 2023. United Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range).Southwest Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.7-$2.8 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). Operating revenue per available seat mile for the third quarter of 2023 is now expected to decline in the 5-7% band from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 3-7% decline).Story continuesAlaska Air now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $3.15-$3.25 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.7-$2.8 range). Due to high fuel costs, the third-quarter adjusted pre-tax margin is now expected in the 10-12% range (earlier guidance was 14-16%). Total revenues are now expected to increase in the 1-2% range from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 0-3% increase).High Labor Costs – Another HeadwindAs if the recent spike in fuel costs was not bad enough for airlines, the northward movement of labor costs adds to its woes. With U.S. airlines grappling with labor shortage in the post-Covid-19 high-demand scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs.American Airlines AAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), recently lifted its forecast for third-quarter non-fuel unit costs due to the four-year pay-related deal with pilots. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Primarily due to high labor and fuel costs, the Zacks Airline industry has declined 9.1% in a month compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 0.1% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

88,d45fdc09-f6ec-3dda-bd73-63171b0761e0,WU,2023-09-08,Western Union (NYSE:WU) Is Due To Pay A Dividend Of $0.235,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-union-nyse-wu-due-102631393.html,1694168791,STORY,['WU'],"[The Western Union Company's (NYSE:WU) investors are due to receive a payment of $0.235 per share on 29th of September. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 7.4%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Western Union Western Union's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last dividend, Western Union is earning enough to cover the payment, but then it makes up 108% of cash flows. This signals that the company is more focused on returning cash flow to shareholders, but it could mean that the dividend is exposed to cuts in the future.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 10.4%. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 56%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendWestern Union Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.40 total annually to $0.94. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.9% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Western Union has impressed us by growing EPS at 15% per year over the past five years. While on an earnings basis, this company looks appealing as an income stock, the cash payout ratio still makes us cautious.Our Thoughts On Western Union's DividendIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Western Union's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Western Union is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Simon Property Group Inc's dividend payout ratio is 1.09, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.Simon Property Group Inc's profitability rank is 7 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects.

REITs offer several benefits to investors, including high dividend payouts. REITs are required to distribute 90% or more of their profits to shareholders as dividends. The large dividend payments make REITs attractive to income investors who are hunting for yield.Additionally, REITs allow investors to speculate on and dabble in sections of the real estate market without having to buy individual properties themselves. Owing to their high dividends and focus on the real estate market, REITs are often a stable choice during times of market volatility. Think a market crash is coming? Here are three real estate stocks to buy for a soft landing.Simon Property Group (SPG)a person standing in a shopping mall with a bag in their hand. May CPI data.Source: ShutterstockSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is a real estate investment trust. The firm has 232 property holdings and is the largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S. The company went through an extremely difficult time during the pandemic when most of its shopping malls were shut down. Those shutdowns later forced Simon Property Group to operate at reduced capacity. Consequently, SPG stock is down 36% over the last five years. However, more recently, the share price has been recovering, rising 14% in the last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrading at 20 times forward earnings, SPG stock looks reasonably valued right now. And it pays shareholders a strong quarterly dividend of $1.90 per share, which yields over 6.50%. Few other stocks have as generous a quarterly payout.With the Covid-19 crisis behind it and consumers back to shopping in person, Simon Property Group looks poised for further gains. The median price target on SPG stock is currently $125.50, implying a 10% upside from current levels.American Tower (AMT)a ground-up view of multiple cell towers in a circleSource: ShutterstockAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) owns and operates towers that are essential for fifth-generation (5G) signal broadcasts. Currently, the company owns more than 200,000 communications sites globally, including more than 40,000 towers and broadcast sites in the U.S. and Canada. The company makes money by leasing space on its towers to telecommunication companies that use the towers for signal antennas and 5G equipment.Story continuesAMT stock has struggled recently, having declined by almost 30% over the last 12 months. The pullback has been due to higher interest rate expenses on its $39 billion of debt (the company funds its land purchases and tower construction with debt). However, there are still reasons to like AMT stock. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.57 per quarter for a yield of roughly 3.50%.

""There is going to be a new normal, but what is the normal?""Thus far the freeze has failed to thaw in 2023, which has been the worst for IPOs year to date since 2016 as measured by deal volume, according to data provider Dealogic.This current quarter is no different thus far, although most of the activity during third quarters tends to happen in the final month of September.Story continuesThere have been 25 IPOs in the current quarter through Sept. 6, valued at $2 billion.

(Patrick Semansky/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Solomon made the argument in July that the worst was over, noting more ""risk-on sentiment"" that month. Other banks made the same point, predicting ""green shoots"" ahead.There was also plenty of caution from some CEOs who warned that it was too early to declare a turnaround. It remains that way inside some big banks.One equity markets banker at a major investment bank told Yahoo Finance that the IPO market in the US is ""still probably not going to get close to historical levels in 2023"" even after counting Arm and Instacart.Another concern, this banker said, is that if Arm ""doesn’t trade well people will be pretty concerned and it will have an impact on the broader market.""Jim Cooney, head of Americas equity capital markets for Bank of America (BAC), said there are 10-15 companies that investors and investment banks are expecting to go public between now and the end of the year.

Ynon, where's-- Will Ferrell's behind you somewhere, right? I'm looking for him, no?YNON KREIZ: Great to see you, Brian. Thank you for having me.BRIAN SOZZI: So what is next on the Barbie front? We're starting to see every week the gross theater receipts continue to increase. You're approaching $2 billion. What is next for this franchise?YNON KREIZ: Well, we couldn't be more excited about the way the movie played out to resounding success, a real execution of Greta Gerwig's vision. And what we're seeing coming out of it, three things. It's the strength and cultural resonance of our brands, is our ability to attract, collaborate, and partner with top creative talent, and our ability to promote and create a cultural event of this movie, leveraging our commercial capabilities in partnership with Warner Brothers, who did a terrific job marketing the movie. So it's been a real combination driven by strong brand and great execution, both creatively and commercially.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Your CFO gave a presentation earlier this morning, I think, for the first time, shared some numbers on how much Mattel may make from this movie. Can you share some of those numbers? And what does it mean for the future financial performance of the company?YNON KREIZ: Yes, we did talk about our revenue, gross billing this year to go up by about $125 million from movie, direct movie participation, toys, and consumer products directly related to the movie, not other Barbie product, at a 60%-- sorry, yeah, 60% operating income margin. So about $75 million operating income contribution directly related to the movie in 2023.BRIAN SOZZI: Is that higher than your expectations? Because from an outside looking in, that's a huge number. And in many respects, Ynon, that's a number that you didn't have last year on the financial statements.YNON KREIZ: Well, we did not expect the movie to be as successful. So it is more than we assumed entering the year. And we expect that in future years, there will be continued benefit from the movie. This is about long-term franchise management. It's not just about the quarter or the year.And we-- it's the thing that we've always talked about, you and me. This was the approach. It was never about just trying to sell more toys. It was about creating a cultural event, creating a societal moment. And we believe the benefit will carry forward for years to come.BRIAN SOZZI: We've talked a lot throughout the years. And this is the first time I've heard you mention franchise management. What does that mean as it pertains to now this cultural juggernaut that you've created? Of course, the Barbie brand has been there for decades. But now you have the movie, you have the content component. How do you manage this?YNON KREIZ: We started our journey as a toy company, as a toy manufacturing company. We evolved to be an IP company that manages franchises. And the biggest change in how we approach our business is to realize that people who buy our products and not just consumers, they are fans. And once you have a lot of fans, it's an audience.And when you realize that you have an audience, it changes the conversation. And the opportunity for you to continue to grow your business. And given that we own one of the strongest portfolios in children and family entertainment franchises in the world, this creates a very unique and exciting opportunities-- opportunity for us to grow outside of the toy aisle into highly accretive business verticals driven by big brands and big franchises, which we own. And the ""Barbie"" movie, we look-- we see as a template, as an example, in terms of how we approach franchise management and expect more to come.BRIAN SOZZI: You have a portfolio of really amazing toy brands that all of us in many respects have grown up using. How do you take this playbook and apply it to some of these brands? What will we see from Mattel over the next 24 months?YNON KREIZ: Our brands are very much timely as much as they are timeless. And we've been doing a lot of work around infusing cultural relevance and societal awareness for what we do with a very strong purpose behind our brands. So it's more than a toy. What we create is more than a play system. It's a holistic approach to engaging-- engage with your fans across multiple levels.And the opportunity for us is not just film. It's also television. It's video games. It's location-based entertainment. It's musicals. It's-- whatever medium is driven by big franchises and big brands. In today's world, this is what it's all about-- big brands, big franchises that elevate and rise above a crowded marketplace. And we believe we are at the beginning of a very exciting part of our journey.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, it's going to be hard to create another nearly $2 billion movie. It just doesn't happen very often. But within the portfolios that you and the portfolio brands you own, what's the brand you're really focused on that you're going to run this playbook with next?YNON KREIZ: Yeah. We're not saying every movie that we make will be as successful, but it will be the same approach, the same methodology, and the same creative take that we are looking to apply. There's the ""Hot Wheels"" movie that we're developing with JJ Abrams. There's a Matchbox movie with Skydance, which produced ""Mission Impossible"" and ""Top Gun."" There's a movie we're developing with Vin Diesel for Rock'em Sock'em Robots, Polly Pocket with Lena Dunham and Lily Collins, and Major Matt Mason with Tom Hanks written by Akiva Goldsman.So these are just a few examples of some of the projects that we're developing. And you can see, given the quality and strength and proven track record of our partners, we believe we have a real shot at creating exciting projects that will appeal to global audiences. And what we saw within the ""Barbie"" movie is that the picture appealed not just to the core buyers of Barbie toys, Barbie product, this was a much broader approach to global audiences across different demographics, men and women, different ages, different generations. And everyone found something that talked to them and touch them at an emotional level.And the credit goes to the incredible execution of this project by Greta Gerwig, who had such a vision and, of course, Margot Robbie as a producer and a lead actor, Ryan Gosling, and, of course, the soundtrack that was a key part of the holistic experience, all of it created something very special that we're very proud of.BRIAN SOZZI: This-- this didn't happen overnight. But my sense has been that you saw the potential of this happening many years ago when you took over at Mattel. From a leadership perspective, how did you identify that? And then how do you ultimately go about bringing that to life?YNON KREIZ: Yeah. This journey has been long in the making, started about five years ago. And from the very beginning, the approach was to create something that was not conventional, something that was not traditional. And the term ""cultural event"" is what we said back in the day. It was never about trying to make a movie or, for that matter, make a movie in order to sell toys.The focus was to create a quality content, quality content that people will want to watch. And we know that if we do that, and if we do that well, good things will happen. And we will sell a lot of toys. So it's not that we didn't want to sell toys, but the mandate and the approach and the relationship and the engagement with the creatives that partnered with us was to focus on making a great movie and not think about selling toys.And what we see now, of course, we have a great movie. We see the success at the box office. And we also are starting to see the success on the toy side of the company with POS for the company year-to-date up, Barbie gaining momentum. And overall, we see good, very exciting opportunity for us to continue to gain share.BRIAN SOZZI: Seemingly, every day, over the past three months, I've read another story about the ""Barbie"" movie, something new happening. But also, you, you've been front and center in a lot of these stories and on, as you should be, because you brought this to life, this cultural event. How have you stayed grounded? And how do you look-- how are you looking to stay grounded over the next few months when you have all these publications writing about you, telling you how successful you are? And how do you just stay focused with all this frenzy around yourself?YNON KREIZ: Well, this very much has been a team effort. It's been a journey with a lot of people that participated and made it all happen. And I couldn't be more proud of the team and everything that we've done collectively. For this to be successful, for this movie to be where it is today, it took a lot of effort. And I'm grateful for everyone's support and involvement.And we really do see it as a beginning of a new chapter. This is not a one-off movie. It's not a one-off project. This has been the strategy. And you followed our story, and you know that we've been consistently made progress in building and driving our IP strategy to reach this point.But it's not the moment we've been waiting to arrive, and we're done by any stretch. This is really one-- another step in the journey. We see it as a template. We see it as an example. As I said before, this is the approach. And we look to replicate that approach in terms of leveraging our brands that have been foundational in this case specifically-- you know, Barbie, it's the ""Barbie"" movie-- working with top talent that have a clear vision and are the best in what they do, which we have done in this movie as well. And of course, commercializing and executing the marketing level and creating demand in a marketplace that became a cultural phenomenon. And so this has been a great and exciting journey. And we're still very much at the early stage of it.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks for making a little time for little old me and on. I appreciate it. I know you're the big star now. But I appreciate it. Thanks for always giving time to Yahoo Finance. It's been fun to follow this journey. I mean, hat tip to you and your team. Ynon Kreiz, Chairman and CEO of Mattel.Seana, back to you in New York.

SLB, Halliburton Co. HAL, Core Laboratories Inc. CLB and Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. SOI.Industry: Oilfield ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2145294/4-oilfield-services-stocks-to-gain-from-the-prospering-industryDrilling activities will possibly improve since the crude pricing environment remains extremely favorable. With the expectations that commodity price will remain handsome this year, demand for oilfield services will stay strong, making the outlook for the Zacks Oil and Gas- Field Services industry promising.Among the frontrunners in the industry that will possibly make the most of the improving business scenario are Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton Co.,Core Laboratories Inc. and Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry comprises companies that primarily engage in providing support services to exploration and production players. These companies help in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining wells, drilling equipment, leasing of drilling rigs, seismic testing, as well as transport and directional solutions, among others. Also, the companies help upstream energy players locate oil and natural gas and drill and evaluate hydrocarbon wells.Hence, oilfield services businesses are positively correlated to expenditures from upstream firms. Furthermore, with countries worldwide investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, a few oilfield service companies are extending their reach beyond the hydrocarbon fields and capitalizing on contracts for manufacturing equipment used in LNG facilities to decrease carbon emissions.3 Trends Defining Oilfield Services Industry's FutureFavorable Oil Price: The price of West Texas Intermediate crude is trading at more than the $85-per-barrel mark, reflecting a very handsome pricing environment. The attractive commodity price is favorable for exploration and production activities, which will boost demand for oilfield services since oilfield service players assist drillers in efficiently setting up oil wells.Story continuesDigital Solutions: Oilfield service players are creating value for clients through digital solutions. With the introduction of a digital platform strategy, companies belonging to the industry are not only accelerating returns but also reducing cycle time. From increasing productivity and efficiency, oilfield service players are also reducing costs and carbon emissions, thereby optimizing cashflows.Growth in International &amp; North American Markets: Given the favorable upstream business scenarios, it is highly likely that capital spending will ramp up in both North American and international markets. Thus, demand for oilfield services will continue to grow this year and beyond, securing higher earnings.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services is a 22-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #73, which places it in the top 29% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may consider, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year.The industry has increased 51.8% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's gain of 15.6% and the broader sector's 6.7% rise.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes not just equity into account but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA, the industry is currently trading at 8.98X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 13.47X and sector's 3.49X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 12.27X, as low as 1.00X, with a median of 7.99X.4 Oilfield Services Stocks Moving Ahead of the PackSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure: More of patented equipment and systems of Solaris will likely be deployed to the prolific oil and gas basins in the United States. This is because favorable commodity prices will likely improve upstream activities, increasing demand for those equipment and systems. Currently, Solaris sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Core Laboratories: Being a well-known provider of patented reservoir description and production enhancement services, the company is well-positioned to grow, thanks to improving demand for reservoir description services. Core Lab, carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), is also focused on reducing its debt load.Schlumberger Limited: Schlumberger is a well-known name in transforming the oil and gas industry by employing its cutting-edge solutions. With its quantifiably proven solutions, it is lowering emissions and its impacts. Schlumberger, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is likely to see earnings growth of 36.7% this year.Halliburton Company: Halliburton is also a leading oilfield service player, capitalizing on improving demand for oilfield services. HAL is likely to witness growth in the international market, while values in the North American market are getting maximized. The firm, with a Zacks Rank of 3, is likely to see earnings growth of more than 41% this year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Shares have lost about 11.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Perrigo due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Beats Q2 Earnings &amp; Sales EstimatesPerrigo reported adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share in second-quarter 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Earnings were up 46.5% year over year. The upside can be attributed to favorable discrete tax benefits from the resolution of various tax matters and lower operating expenses incurred by the company during the quarter.Net sales increased 6.4% year over year to $1.19 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, sales rose 6.6%. The upside was driven by strategic pricing actions undertaken by management during the quarter, sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma and the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian Good Start infant formula brand. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 0.8% year over year.Segment DiscussionCSCA: The segment’s net sales in the second quarter of 2023 came in at $750.8 million, up 3.1% year over year, driven by acquisitions and strategic price increases. However, this upside was partially offset by purposeful SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins as part of the company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program undertaken last year.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $442.4 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago period’s levels. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 12.8% year over year. Organically, sales increased 7.1%. Segment revenues benefited from higher sales of HRA Pharma brands and strategic pricing actions. An unfavorable currency movement negatively impacted sales.Story continues2023 GuidancePerrigo reiterated its financial guidance for 2023. Management expects to report net sales growth in the range of 7-11%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $2.50 and $2.70. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 17%, while the company expects to record interest expenses of about $180 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.15% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Perrigo has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Perrigo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPerrigo is part of the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Over the past month, Stryker (SYK), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.5%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.Stryker reported revenues of $5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.2%. EPS of $2.54 for the same period compares with $2.25 a year ago.Stryker is expected to post earnings of $2.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.Stryker has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.

It risks a backlash against both companies.“We’ve almost always avoided these kinds of disputes,” said Christopher Winfrey, president of Charter Communications, during a call with analysts and investors last week. “But we had to draw a line in the sand.“We respect the product that Disney produces, and its management team, but the video ecosystem is broken.”Charter, which boasts 32 million customers across 41 states, says it was left with no choice but to pull Disney’s channels following lengthy and difficult negotiations with Disney over a new contract.Story continuesThe company – which counts Liberty Media, Malone’s main business, as its top shareholder – says Disney is demanding more money for its channels but is refusing to give Charter’s customers access to its streaming service, Disney+.Malone, the billionaire businessman nicknamed the “Cable Cowboy” in the industry, is right to be wary.The rise of streaming services has led to a surge in so-called “cable cutting”, where US households cancel their expensive cable packages and opt for lower cost streaming instead. The trend threatens the bedrock of his business.Charter argues its customers are being double-charged for Disney programmes: once as part of access through their cable package, then again if they want to stream them.Disney also wanted to allow “even less flexibility” in how its channels are packaged up into bundles, Charter claimed.The company says it previously expected to pay Disney $2.2bn for content in 2023 but that the entertainment giant’s latest demands “ignore the realities of today’s video business”.John Malone's main business Liberty Media is the top shareholder in Charter Communications - REUTERS/Rick WilkingOver the last five years, the linear video industry – television broadcast to a schedule – has lost almost 25 million customers, or roughly 25pc of the previous total.“It’s staggering,” Winfrey remarked.Much of this is the result of services such as Netflix that have eroded the structural advantages enjoyed by linear TV providers in the past, says Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis.In large swathes of the US, only one or two cable TV and broadband providers are available, resulting in higher prices compared to the UK and less choice.A common practice has always been to bundle popular channels – such as Disney’s ESPN – together with less popular ones.But people are much less willing to pay for channels they won’t watch in an era of “a la carte” streaming services that allow them to choose what they watch and when.“For cable TV providers like Charter, it is about as bad as it has ever been,” says Harrington.Meanwhile, many of the traditional content producers that have long licensed channels and programming to cable TV services are themselves haemorrhaging cash as they go toe-to-toe with Netflix by launching their own streaming platforms.Disney+ offers viewers everything from traditional animated classics such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast to Marvel movies, Star Wars spin-offs and TV series like Atlanta.Yet in its most recent quarter alone, Disney’s streaming operation lost $512m – taking total losses since its 2019 launch to $11bn.Iger, who was the company’s boss from 2005 to 2020 and then returned last year, has been brought back to hammer its finances back into shape. Squeezing a little more money out of partners such as Charter can’t hurt.Rival services include Paramount+, Warner Bros Discovery’s MAX and NBCUniversal’s Peacock face similar problems.Many want to attract subscribers to their new streaming platforms by offering a library of content they can’t access elsewhere, while at the same time selling their content to cable TV providers.In some cases, this has resulted in attempts to get around exclusivity deals with cable TV companies in ways that have raised eyebrows.For example, CNN’s news programming is supposed to be broadcast first on the cable and satellite TV services it has deals with.However, the channel has opted to make exclusive programmes to go on HBO’s MAX service to circumvent these restrictions.Christopher Winfrey, president of Charter Communications, said the company was forced to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in its dealings with DisneyFor Disney and its competitors, the fees from linear TV remain a vital source of income – bringing in far more than streaming does.The Disney-Charter dispute should be seen in this context, says Harrington.“Cable TV companies are under stress. But Charter probably thinks that Disney is under pressure too, and has calculated they can push it a bit further than if things were going well,” he explains.“They also feel that Disney’s channels are not worth as much as they were during the last negotiations, because a lot of content is now on Disney+.”Also hanging over the negotiations is Disney’s refusal to guarantee that cable TV customers who already pay for the ESPN channel will be able to access a planned on-demand ESPN service without paying extra.“They want to require customers to pay twice to get content apps with the linear video they have already paid for,” Charter’s Winfrey said.The row has parallels with a separate dispute playing out across the Atlantic, with customary British twists.Here, the likes of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 have been grappling with pay TV providers and television manufacturers for years over so-called “prominence”, or where their own apps and content gets placed in key software menus.For years the BBC has occupied the prestigious channels such as 101 and 102 on set top box services such as Sky and Freeview, but there are currently no hard rules on where TV makers such as Samsung should place them on smart TV menus.Instead, manufacturers have struck deals that give companies like Netflix top billing – and even include “Netflix” buttons on their television remotes.This new broadcasting land grab is happening amidst a once-in-a-generation shift in how people watch things.Audiences are flocking online, particularly young people. Public service broadcasters are desperate to build up the following of their own services, including BBC iPlayer, ITVX and Channel 4 On Demand, amid a panic that they may be left behind by Hollywood juggernauts.Ian Katz, chief content officer at Channel 4, recently defended a slump in the broadcaster’s so-called linear audience numbers, insisting that he was prioritising its streaming platform instead.“Frankly, any broadcaster who obsesses about linear ratings now risks going the way of Kodak or Blockbuster – great brands that fail to notice that the ground was shifting under their feet,” he said at last month’s Edinburgh TV festival.Back in the US, experts say Charter’s high-stakes punch-up with Disney could end up smashing the traditional pay TV model.Disney, for its part, says it has offered “the most favourable terms on rates, distribution, packaging, advertising and more” in talks so far.“Charter has refused to enter into a new agreement with us that reflects market-based terms,” the company claimed.“We are on the edge of a precipice,” Winfrey said last week. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”With fists raised, the only question now is who will blink first.“We are on the edge of a precipice,” Winfrey said last week. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”In a new statement on Thursday night, Disney accused Charter of “abandon[ing] their consumers” but said it “stands ready to resolve this dispute”.Disney accused Charter of rejecting “multiple offers to extend negotiations before taking Disney Entertainment’s networks down” and said it had “proposed creative ways to make its streaming services available to Charter’s Spectrum TV subscribers.”The media giant said: “The question for Charter is clear: Do you care about your subscribers and what they’re telling you they want – or not?”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with PEG. Click here to check it out. PEG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PEGPublic Service Enterprise Group is a holding company with diversified business operations. It has a regulated utility, PSE&amp;G, and non-regulated businesses such as nuclear power generation and clean energy projects. PSE&amp;G delivers regulated gas and electricity services to a combined 4 million customers in New Jersey. The company also operates the Long Island Power Authority system. In 2022, it sold its gas and oil power plants in the Mid-Atlantic, New York, and the Northeast. With a stock price of $59.55, the company's market cap stands at $29.70 billion. This article aims to analyze if this price aligns with the company's intrinsic value, as estimated by the GF Value.Unveiling Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates a stock's intrinsic value. It's computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line represents the ideal fair trading value of the stock. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, the stock of Public Service Enterprise Group (NYSE:PEG) is estimated to be modestly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength AnalysisInvesting in companies with poor financial strength can lead to a higher risk of permanent capital loss. Hence, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to invest in its stock. Public Service Enterprise Group's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03 is worse than 88.31% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This indicates that the overall financial strength of Public Service Enterprise Group is poor.Unveiling Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is usually less risky. Public Service Enterprise Group has been profitable 9 over the past 10 years. Its operating margin is 31.62%, ranking better than 88.91% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This indicates fair profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in the valuation of a company. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Public Service Enterprise Group is -0.5%, which ranks worse than 83.75% of companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -9.5%, ranking worse than 84.03% of companies in the industry. This suggests poor growth.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another way to determine its profitability. The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Public Service Enterprise Group's ROIC is 6.06, and its WACC is 5.31.Unveiling Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right?

Prior to this, in August 2023, the United States offered a $250 million aid to Ukraine, for supplying air defense and artillery munitions, mine-clearing equipment and medical vehicles.The latest commitment made by President Biden takes the total security assistance provided by America to Ukraine to $43.7 billion since February 2022, following Russia’s Ukrainian invasion.  The new security package has currently put the spotlight on U.S. defense majors like RTX Corporation RTX, Lockheed Martin LMT and General Dynamics GD, which are expected to gain in the near term.Details of the PackageThe latest aid package marks the 46th tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine, since August 2021.

Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.The women accused company officials of being aware and failing to act on allegations of misconduct before Steve Wynn resigned in February 2018. He was not a named a defendant in the case.Wynn, now 81 and living in Florida, has paid record monetary fines to gambling regulators but consistently has denied sexual misconduct allegations in multiple courts.The plaintiffs are identified in the lawsuit only as Judy Doe No. 1 through Judy Doe No. 9. Their attorneys, led by Kathleen England and Jason Maier, did not respond Thursday to emails from The Associated Press.Wynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver declined to comment.Steve Wynn's lawyers in Las Vegas, Colby Williams and Donald Campbell, did not respond Thursday to an email from AP requesting comment.The settlement was first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal.U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro scheduled a Nov. 6 court date to dismiss the case to allow time for completion of “the settlement process, including the issuance of settlement fund,"" according to the court filing.The lawsuit was filed in September 2019 in Nevada state court and moved in October 2019 to U.S. District Court. It was dismissed in July 2020 by a federal judge in Las Vegas who faulted it for using pseudonyms and not specifying individual harassment claims.The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals revived it in November 2021, ruling the nine women could remain anonymous and amend their complaint to add individual harassment allegations.Steve Wynn resigned from his corporate positions after the Wall Street Journal published allegations by several women that he sexually harassed or assaulted them at his hotels. He divested company shares, quit the corporate board and resigned as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee.Story continuesWynn in July agreed to end a yearslong battle with the Nevada Gaming Commission by paying a $10 million fine and cutting ties to the casino industry he helped shape in Las Vegas, where he developed luxury properties including the Golden Nugget, Mirage and Bellagio. He also developed the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; and Wynn Macau in China.His former company, Wynn Resorts Ltd., paid the commission $20 million in February 2019 for failing to investigate the sexual misconduct claims made against him.Massachusetts gambling regulators fined Wynn Resorts another $35 million and new company chief executive Matthew Maddox $500,000 for failing to disclose when applying for a license for the Encore Boston Harbor resort that there had been sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn.Wynn Resorts agreed in November 2019 to accept $20 million in damages from Steve Wynn and $21 million more from insurance carriers on behalf of current and former employees of Wynn Resorts to settle shareholder lawsuits accusing company directors of failing to disclose misconduct allegations.]"

Shares have lost about 1.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Zoetis due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Zoetis’ Q2 Earnings and Revenues Surpass EstimatesZoetis Inc. delivered second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings (excluding one-time items) of $1.41 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the company delivered earnings of $1.20 per share.Total revenues grew 6% year over year to $2.2 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion in the reported quarter.Quarterly HighlightsZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.Revenues from the U.S. segment increased 7% year over year to $1.165 billion in the second quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.174 billion. The reported figure beat our estimate of $1.156 billion in total U.S. revenues.Sales of companion animal products in the U.S. region rose 7% from the prior-year quarter’s level due to increased sales of the company’s key dermatology portfolio, including Apoqueland Cytopoint. Growth in the sales of Zoetis’ vaccine portfolio and Solensia, a monoclonal antibody product for osteoarthritis pain in cats, also contributed to the increased revenues in the second quarter.Sales of livestock products surged 5% year over year in the reported quarter, fueled by an increase in cattle product sales like Draxxin and implant product Synovex. Revenues from poultry products also increased, driven by the sales growth of vaccines and medicated feed additives.Story continuesHowever, the growth trend in revenues was partially offset by a decline in swine product revenues due to lower disease prevalence.Revenues in the International segment improved 6% year over year and 11% on an operational basis to $995 million in the second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $980 million. The reported figure missed our estimate of $998 million in total International revenues.Sales of companion animal products grew 13% on a reported basis and 17% on an operational basis, driven by growth in several key products. These include monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain like Librela for dogs and Solensia for cats, dermatology products like Apoquel and Cytopoint as well as Zoetis’ new parasiticide products, such as Revolution/Stronghold and the Simparica Trio.On a year-over-year basis, livestock product sales declined 1% on a reported basis and 4% operationally. Growth in the cattle portfolio was driven by expansion as well as rotating medicated feed additives into core poultry markets like Latin America, the European Union and Middle East.In the second quarter, Zoetis’ fish portfolio also witnessed an uptick in sales on the back of increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, primarily Norway and Chile. Livestock product sales in this segment increased during the quarter due to pricing in hyperinflationary markets and supply recovery, partially offset by pricing in hyperinflationary markets and supply recovery.Swine product sales suffered a decline in the International segment as well, owing to supply constraints in Western Europe.2023 Financial GuidanceZoetis updated its previously issued guidance for 2023.Revenues are now projected in the range of $8.500-$8.650 billion (previously $8.575-$8.725 billion), adjusting the impact of foreign exchange rates, although maintaining expected operational growth of 6-8%.The company now expects adjusted earnings in the band of $5.37-$5.47 per share (previously $5.34-$5.44 per share) for the full-year 2023.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Zoetis has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Zoetis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerZoetis belongs to the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry. Another stock from the same industry, Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), has gained 4.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended June 2023.Corcept reported revenues of $117.72 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.9%. EPS of $0.25 for the same period compares with $0.24 a year ago.Corcept is expected to post earnings of $0.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -33.3%.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.Despite recent stock market challenges, Wall Street remains cautiously optimistic about potential returns in the coming months. In August, global stocks had their second-worst month of the year, dropping 2.96%. Rising bond yields and concerns about China's economy contributed to this decline. JPMorgan's Madison Faller believes 2023 can end on a positive note, reported CNBC. She notes that valuations have become more attractive after late-summer market turbulence, offering opportunities to rebuild equity exposure. Higher interest rates, driven by the Federal Reserve's actions, may create better bond entry points and protect against surprises. The debate on monetary policy has shifted from rate heights to how long central banks will keep them elevated. If inflation cools while rates stay high, it might set the stage for future rate cuts. Goldman Sachs has reduced the likelihood of a U.S. recession 2024 to 15%, supporting a ""soft landing"" scenario, which is typically favorable for equities. JPMorgan Private Bank shares a similar view, not anticipating a recession despite higher interest rates but rather a ""softish landing."" Consumers have maintained solid spending habits, with recent retail data showing resilience, albeit with some shifts toward thriftier options and goods. The latest earnings season brought positive surprises, with S&amp;P 500 earnings exceeding expectations and rising steadily. Companies increasingly focus on long-term growth, with AI investments surging across industries. Technology stocks, especially AI ones, have driven market gains this year, though selectivity remains essential. Companies with strong balance sheets, cash generation, and the ability to compound returns over time are gaining favor in a rising-rate environment. As interest rates rise, this trend benefits profitable, strong balance sheet tech companies over speculative, unprofitable counterparts.Story continuesOn September 7, US stock futures experienced a decline, and the dollar reached a six-month high as investors increased their expectations of further Federal Reserve policy tightening. Nasdaq 100 futures have fallen by 0.7%, with notable drops in premarket trading for companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down approximately 2%. Concerns arose after news of China's intention to prohibit iPhones in certain government agencies, impacting US technology stocks, which have been at the forefront of this year's market gains. The rally in oil prices has paused as traders shift their focus to stockpile levels. After a nine-day winning streak, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil began to dip towards $87 per barrel. This remarkable run, the longest in over four years since January 2019, pushed prices into overbought territory. The surge was triggered by OPEC+ leaders' decision to extend supply cuts until the end of 2023, providing strong support to oil prices. However, the recent decline in oil prices comes as the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a substantial drop of 5.5 million barrels in US crude inventories. This suggests a potential rebalancing of supply and demand dynamics in the oil market, contributing to the overall sentiment among traders. While oil prices have paused, the market remains attentive to factors such as supply levels, geopolitical developments, and demand trends, which can influence the direction of crude oil prices in the coming months.On the stock market front, just like the drop in Nasdaq 100 futures in premarket trading for companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), analysts are bearish on several stocks by trimming their price targets. Check out the complete article to see details of these stocks.Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks10. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.47 (+0.44%)On September 6, RBC Capital revised its price target for Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK), setting a new target of $124, down from the previous $133. Furthermore, the investment firm has maintained its ""Sector Perform"" rating for its shares. This adjustment in the target price was driven by an update made by their analyst in response to the prevailing economic conditions, particularly a consistently higher interest rate environment. To reflect this persistent shift in interest rates, RBC Capital has reevaluated the valuation metrics for Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK) and other regulated utilities. Specifically, they have recalibrated the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, which serve as a key determinant in assessing the value of these companies. In this recalibration, RBC Capital employs a 4.5% 10-year Treasury yield as the benchmark, a notable departure from previous valuation methods. The adjustment in P/E multiples significantly impacted the valuations of Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK) and similar utilities, resulting in a 13% reduction. This highlights how changes in interest rates can affect utility companies' perceived value to investors. In summary, RBC Capital lowered the price target and kept a ""Sector Perform"" rating for Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK) due to recalibrated valuation metrics driven by persistent high interest rates, leading to a notable decrease in assessed valuations.Just as the negative sentiment impacted premarket trading for Nasdaq 100 futures, with companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) seeing declines, analysts are adopting a bearish stance on Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK).09. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.51 (-0.77%)On September 6, RBC Capital revised its price target for NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), adjusting it from $90 to $89. Despite this slight reduction, the investment firm holds an ""Outperform"" rating for the company's shares. This revision in the price target results from RBC Capital's commitment to providing accurate and up-to-date assessments in response to prevailing economic conditions, particularly the consistent presence of higher interest rates. To better align with this enduring trend of elevated interest rates, RBC Capital's analyst has reviewed the valuation metrics applied to NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and other regulated utility companies. Specifically, the valuation multiples, including the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, have been recalibrated.

(NYSE:NEE), emphasizing the importance of adapting to evolving economic conditions when evaluating investments in the utility sector.08. SJW Group (NYSE:SJW)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.67 (-1.05%)On September 6, RBC Capital adjusted its price target for SJW Group (NYSE:SJW), reducing it from $85 to $76. Despite this reduction, the investment firm has opted to maintain a ""Sector Perform"" rating for the company's shares. This change in the price target is a response to the ongoing economic environment characterized by consistently elevated interest rates. RBC Capital's analyst reviewed the valuation metrics applied to SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) and other regulated utility companies to align with this enduring trend of higher interest rates. Specifically, they recalibrated the valuation multiples, including the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, to incorporate a 4.5% yield on the 10-year Treasury as a benchmark. This marks a shift from previous valuation methodologies.The adjustment in the P/E multiples has notably impacted the perceived valuations of SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) and similar utility firms.

These adjustments were made in response to the enduring presence of higher interest rates, prompting a recalibration of valuation metrics.

JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.47 (-1.37%)On September 6, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson opted to maintain his ""Hold"" rating for JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), a prominent e-commerce company. However, he has made a downward adjustment to the price target, revising it from $42 to $39. This update from the analyst reflects his current assessment of JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) performance and potential within the market. While the ""Hold"" rating suggests a neutral stance, the reduced price target indicates a less optimistic outlook than the previous valuation. Similar to the decline in premarket trading of Nasdaq 100 futures affecting companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), market analysts hold a pessimistic outlook for JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).Baron Emerging Markets Fund made the following comment about JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the three largest e-commerce platforms in China. Shares declined after the company reported a slowdown in fourth quarter sales and commented that deliberate culling of unprofitable SKUs would also be a drag on headline revenue growth in the first half of 2023. We believe the slowdown was driven by the peak in Chinese COVID lockdowns, which have since ended, and the elimination or reduction of unprofitable business is better for long-term margins and returns on capital. We remain investors.”06. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.84 (-1.80%)As of September 6, Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell upheld a ""Neutral"" rating on Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), a significant energy company. However, he has made a notable downward adjustment to the price target, revising it from the previous target of $58 down to $46. This decision by the analyst reflects his current assessment of Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) performance and prospects in the market. While the ""Neutral"" rating suggests a relatively balanced view, the reduced price target indicates a more cautious outlook than the prior valuation. Analysts regularly update their assessments based on various factors, including company financials, market conditions, and industry developments, to provide investors with the most up-to-date guidance.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) traded lower following the surprise announcement of the company’s strategic review. The company is likely to sell several business units, which will impact future earnings. As a result of earnings uncertainty, we decided to sell the stock.” Click to continue reading and see Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price TargetsAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street AnalystsDisclosure: None.

A modern world stock market equivalent would be the industrial sector. The sector does not provide glamorous, futuristic product offerings like electric cars and artificial intelligence but is arguably the backbone of the economy. If there weren’t any railroads to transport products to market, or pipes and furnaces to run manufacturing units, operating the other fancied sectors would be next to impossible.Recent industrial sector performance suggests the economy may be gaining traction. The S&amp;P 500 Select Sector SPDR for Industrials (XLI) has been one of the success stories of the year, with investors turning bullish on the sector. XLI has progressed 13.3% year to date and grown 17.6% over the last 12 months, as of Jul 31, 2023.In July, total industrial production increased 1%, following declines in the previous two months. Manufacturing output rose 0.5% in the same period. Also, with the reduced likelihood of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates in its next meeting or the meeting after, the industrial sector is likely to get a further boost. This is because rising costs of essentials like copper and crude oil adversely impact the sector, and the absence of that entails good news.It will be thus prudent to invest in Industrials as the tight monetary policy regime comes to a gradual end, and the defensive nature of the sector takes over. Even if the economy enters a period of recession, the sector might be the wheels to take it out of the mud. Big players in the sector are also known to distribute dividends and thus provide a steady source of income for investors.Our ChoicesThe stocks below flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and regularly pay dividends to shareholders. The search was also narrowed down with a VGM Score of A or B. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

Now, Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma is here with the details. Sounds like music to all of us food lovers is right now.BROOKE DIPALMA: Sounds like music to my ears too. I mean, what an innovation. The future is here, Rachelle. Essentially, Tyson using AI technology to transport its inventory as the company continues to tackle the supply chain issue that it faced in the recent quarterly results. So really, what this comes down to is Tyson is teaming up with Gatik. It's a multi-year contract that kicked off last week. It'll start with four trucks that will roll out and essentially work to deliver those products inventory from the plants to cold storage facilities.Now, Gatik did create these Class 7 autonomous vehicles specifically for Tyson to create an opportunity to carry those heavier foods. Now, the next several trucks will be delivered in about a month, and that middle mile is what they're really looking to get at. These will be used in shorter trips, think 10 to 15 miles. And what is being tested right now is something that, for the time being, will actually have a person inside the autonomous vehicle as that AI technology learns these routes.And essentially, when we talked to Tyson, they were very optimistic about this rollout as the company looks really to double down on its supply chain. They said that there's about 40 sites that should this all go well, that they've identified where this autonomous vehicle technology can be used to transport its inventory, once again, from those cold storage facilities-- or rather from the plants to the cold storage facilities. And one executive telling Yahoo Finance that this really is a productivity gain.When you think about drivers, based upon rules and safety rules set by the DOT, they're only allowed to drive about 11 hours a day. But when you think about these autonomous vehicles, they can essentially run all day, but they intend to use them for about 18 hours a day. And other partners that Gatik has teamed up with also include Kroger as well as Tyson's next-door neighbor in Northwest Arkansas Walmart. And so certainly, lots underway in Tyson's HQ, but also it'll be interesting to watch the efficiency gains that comes from Tyson in the months to come.RACHELLE AKKUFO: Indeed, interesting development there, especially since during the pandemic, we were talking about truck driver shortage. So clearly some solutions here on the table. Brooke DiPalma, thank you so much.]"

Right now they are being used to make short deliveries from a production plant to multiple cold storage facilities, which are typically 10 to 15 miles apart.""We’re after what I would call our middle mile,"" Simmons said. ""If everything goes well, which we plan on it being that way at scale, there's really 40 sites that we've identified across the United States at some point in the future that we could roll this out.""Tyson Foods, Inc. and Gatik AI Inc. are testing autonomous trucks to deliver cold food from the plant to the storage facility. (Courtesy: Tyson Foods).For the time being, drivers will continue to be in the vehicles as the AI software learns the routes. Eventually, the trucks will be completely driverless, which could happen in as soon as six months.Other companies that Gatik has worked with include Kroger (KR), which in March announced plans to deliver groceries to stores in Dallas, and Tyson's neighbor in northwest Arkansas, Walmart (WMT).'A better fit'According to Simmons, now is the right time for innovation around transportation.""Coming out of the lessons of COVID, there was a lot of supply chain struggles, not just within our industry but within every industry across the globe,"" he said. ""This enables us to become more self-reliant, more agile, mobile, flexible, and better serve the business and ultimately our customers.""Tyson turned to AI technology in part due to the truck driver shortage ""that was amplified during the pandemic"" and still exists today, Simmons said. He also stressed that the autonomous trucks were not about eliminating jobs but finding a better fit for existing drivers.Story continues""Truck drivers don't like to do those short-term runs that are in and out of traffic,"" he said. ""They like to get out on the highway and go 65 miles an hour and go 300, 400, 500 miles at a time.""A Tyson Foods semi-truck on Interstate 80 near North Platte, Nebraska. (Getty Images) (RiverNorthPhotography via Getty Images)The AI component of the driverless truck also allows the company to use each vehicle longer than a traditional truck driver would be able to based on safety rules from the Department of Transportation. Instead of having drivers operate vehicles for 11 hours at a time, Tyson is planning on running the driverless trucks 18 hours a day.As the company looks to the future, Simmons also said the efforts could help attract younger generations of workers, who are generally more interested in technology careers and will be able to manage the fleet remotely or by drone.""That's a productivity gain for us,"" Simmons said. ""Then we're able to repurpose our truck driver. It's a better fit for what that driver would like to be doing anyhow.""Tyson faces 'challenging' yearTyson has been looking to get back on its feet after a string of disappointing quarterly results. Shares of the mass food producer are down 30% over the past 12 months.Tyson Foods CEO Donnie King told Yahoo Finance recently in an exclusive interview that there has never been ""a more challenging time"" in his 40 years in the business. ""The macro environment is challenging, and it'll continue to be challenging for a bit,"" King added.In the most recent quarter, Tyson's earnings fell short of estimates as weakened consumer demand and a supply glut caused prices to fall for many products.The company also shared plans to shutter three chicken-processing locations in October of this year, including facilities located in North Little Rock, Ark.; Noel, Mo.; and Dexter, Mo. The fourth location — in Corydon, Ind. — will close on or around March 1, 2024.Following the results, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman wrote that the closures were ""helpful to margins but not to an industry that remains arguably over-supplied.""""Either way, it’s good to see the company lean into what Donnie King sometimes does best — run efficient businesses — and we think it’s reasonable to model MSD operating margins for this segment as soon as 4Q23,"" Goldman added.As part of those plans to streamline operations, Tyson also said it will launch a new supply chain center and announced that Brady Stewart, who previously oversaw the fresh meats business, will become the company's chief supply chain officer.As far as the outlook for 2023, the company now expects total sales between $53 billion and $54 billion for the full year, with sales growth flat year over year.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Unsustainable Without Women,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-sustainable-development-unsustainable-without-203000110.html,1694118600,STORY,['MA'],"[The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthNEW DELHI, INDIA / ACCESSWIRE / September 7, 2023 / ""If we are to make meaningful progress in creating a more balanced, equitable and inclusive society, we must place women at the center stage of all development priorities,"" declared Amitabh Kant, India's Sherpa, or lead envoy, to the G20, at the opening of the first Asia Inclusive Growth Forum here on Friday.The day-long event, hosted by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth and brought to India in partnership with Sattva, gathered private and social sector leaders, fintechs, entrepreneurs, government officials, multilateral organizations and academics to share insights on what it will take to accelerate inclusive growth across Asia and close the continent's gender gap.At the top of the list: making the long-term digitization of economies more equitable. That can be done in part through open-source APIs and citizen-owned data, finding new ways to improve access to credit for women entrepreneurs, and forging innovative partnerships to extend the benefits of digitization to women in rural areas.To give women entrepreneurs in India better access to financial services, Airtel Payments Bank, Frontier Markets and Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth announced the launch of She Leads Bharat: Udyam at the forum. In India, one in five micro, small and medium enterprises are owned by women, but women receive only 5% of total financing by public-sector banks.""Access to credit is a massive challenge today, yet it holds the key to unlocking the next level of economic development - particularly when applied to women entrepreneurs,"" said Ari Sarker, Mastercard's Asia Pacific president.The initiative will give 100,000 women small-business owners in rural areas access to resources, networks and tools via Frontier Markets' Meri-Saheli platform. It's a first-of-its-kind partnership that brings together private sector, social enterprise and philanthropy to show what a digital-first model can be, said Ajaita Shah, Frontier Markets' founder and CEO.Story continuesAt the forum, participants highlighted three areas where centering on women can help drive sustainable development.01 Digitization is core to equal opportunity creation""What we have learned at the Center for Inclusive Growth is that when it comes to lending, women don't just pay it back, but also pay it forward to their communities and the country,"" says Shamina Singh, the center's founder and president. ""Doing well and doing good, by choice or by chance, not only makes sense for society, but it also makes good business sense.""The digital acceleration has helped women across Asia, and in particular India, access services across sectors. The number of female internet users has risen significantly in the past few years, putting more power in their hands and bringing about a paradigm shift in commerce. Key to this momentum is keeping an open network as it's the economy's foundation, said T Koshy, CEO of the Open Network for Digital Commerce, a government-led interconnected e-commerce platform. He characterized his platform as an equal opportunity model, helping consumers select the best-quality product - not just the best-marketed one.Women also need safe spaces to thrive on the internet, said Sairee Chahal, the co-founder and CEO of Mahila Money, a financial platform for women, and the founder of SHEROES, a women-only social network. ""When you feel safe, when you feel included, you experiment, you learn,"" she said. ""You can find work; you can become entrepreneurial.""02 Keep women at the forefront of climate actionWomen account for about 80% of people displaced by the climate crisis, so gender mainstreaming ― taking into account the different needs and circumstances of women and men when developing policy and programs ― may be critical when looking at issues of climate finance, adaptation and mitigation, said Rathish Balakrishnan, managing partner at the social impact consulting group Sattva.And that means including women in the decision-making process, said Deepali Khanna, the Rockefeller Foundation's chief representative for Asia. Consulting women and co-creating with a community, she said, is the way to create scalable solutions that properly address people's needs.03 A healthy economy needs healthy womenAccess to quality healthcare services is necessary to empower the next generation of female leaders. Women in Asia have been underserved, due in part to deep-rooted stigmas around a variety of health conditions and lack of practical treatment plans, said Shobhita Narain. She is the co-founder of Veera Health, an online clinic that treats polycystic ovary syndrome, which, if left untreated, can lead to reproductive problems and affects as many as one in five Indian women.Digitizing health care, including access to online health care literature and telemedicine, is helping women, said Shobana Kamineni, executive vice chairperson of Apollo Hospitals, the largest hospital chain in India. Science and medicine need to focus more on women's health care, she said. Plus, employers need to modify benefits, such as offering support for maternity planning and prenatal needs - which will support women's choices and retain female employees in the workforce, she added.Originally published by The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthCheck out more content from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard-center-inclusive-growthEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/781895/mastercard-sustainable-development-unsustainable-without-women]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

The new platform is infused with beneficial features, such as dynamic discounting, early payment and price discovery, which may offer an opportunity to enterprises and vendors to boost their cash flows and gain greater access to working capital.Meanwhile, the payments solution will serve the purpose of a complete procure-to-pay offering for businesses, which, in turn, is expected to impart more efficiency in invoice matching and processing. In view of a rapidly growing digital economy, small businesses may often find it difficult to adopt digital means due to the dearth of finances and resources.Consequently, the new platform may also prove to be a blessing in disguise for small vendors and save a substantial portion of their expenses, which would have been exhausted in technology upgradation. It will enable such businesses to seamlessly receive payments without the need of in-house payment gateways and point-of-sale machines.The latest partnership reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to roll out cutting-edge solutions and streamline digital payments acceptance by businesses of all sizes.  Such moves also highlight MA’s endeavor to bolster its B2B products and services portfolio as well as widen its customer base.Simultaneously, the tech giant collaborated with KredX to remove the frequent hurdles, which crop up while making B2B payments, with a particular focus on easing the card-enabled ones.

Apple Inc.’s iPhone is facing a widening ban in China that would bar the device from government-backed agencies and state companies. Qualcomm is one of the iPhone’s biggest vendors, responsible for the product’s modem chip.And US lawmakers are scrutinizing suppliers to Huawei Technologies Co., with some calling for a halt to all US exports to the controversial Chinese tech company. San Diego-based Qualcomm provides Huawei with older-generation 4G chips.China, including Hong Kong, accounts for roughly two-thirds of Qualcomm’s revenue. So investors are closely watching developments in that market. The stock plunged 7.2% to $106.40 Thursday on the latest news, alongside shares of other mobile-phone suppliers.A representative for Qualcomm declined to comment.The Huawei controversy centers on China’s top chipmaker, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which appears to have violated US sanctions by supplying advanced components to the blacklisted company, US lawmakers said.“It sure looks like it did” violate sanctions, Representative Michael McCaul said Wednesday at a briefing at the US embassy in the Hague. SMIC continues “to try to get our intellectual property.”Huawei uses an advanced 7-nanometer processor built by SMIC to power its latest smartphone, a teardown commissioned by Bloomberg News showed, indicating that China is making headway in its push to produce cutting-edge semiconductors despite US sanctions. It didn’t include a Qualcomm component, however.Story continuesExisting rules require any company that intends to supply Huawei with US technology, which is present throughout SMIC’s operations, to get approval from Washington. It’s unclear whether SMIC has a US license to supply Huawei.McCaul, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been vocal in protesting what he considers insufficient enforcement of the Entity List, which is enforced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security and specifies license requirements imposed on restricted exports. Neither McCaul nor his committee have much direct sway over sanctions.Representative Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House Select Committee on Competition with China, picked up on the theme, suggesting the US should end all its exports to both Huawei and SMIC — even those involving older technologies that are currently allowed under the law.“The time has come to end all U.S. technology exports to both Huawei and SMIC to make clear any firm that flouts US law and undermines our national security will be cut off from our technology,” Gallagher said in a statement.--With assistance from Cagan Koc, Sarah Jacob, Debby Wu and Ian King.(Updates shares starting in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutJames Dolan’s $2.3 Billion Sphere Is Raising Eyebrows—in a Good WayGoogle’s Ties With Apple Under Spotlight in Antitrust TrialHuawei’s Surprise Phone Gives Ammo to Biden Doubters on ChinaLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) Here©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This launch should further strengthen Lockheed Martin’s position in the space satellite market.Lockheed’s Place in Satellite MarketSDA’s Transport Layer aims to provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to the full range of warfighter platforms. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the satellites that Lockheed launched recently come with LMT’s SmartSat software, which makes it easier to dynamically add and quickly change missions in orbit through simple app uploads.The satellites also host Link-16 radios, which enable sensor-to-shooter targeting by connecting systems that include fighter aircraft and Integrated Air and Missile Defense networks. This, in turn, will modernize the United States’ current capabilities to better support warfighter needs to act timely against threat warnings and provide situational awareness information across the range of military operations.Such benefits offered by Lockheed’s satellites must have enabled the company to win the contract of building 36 Tranche 2 Transport Layer Beta satellites in August 2023 from the SDA. LMT is also producing 42 satellites for SDA's Tranche 1 Transport Layer, to be launched in 2024. Further, the company recently opened a satellite processing center to efficiently assemble, integrate and test these satellites.These developments reflect the solid demand that Lockheed enjoys in the space surveillance market, with space-based assets being increasingly used in defending a nation against hostile attacks.Growth ProspectsPer a report by the Research And Markets firm, the global military satellites market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2023-2027 period. This should benefit Lockheed Martin, which provides national security space capabilities.A few other defense players that can gain from the expanding military satellite market are Airbus SE EADSY, L3Harris Technologies Inc. LHX and Northrop Grumman Inc. NOC.   Airbus’ Defense and Space unit has delivered more than 70 Earth observation satellite systems, accumulating close to 600 years of in-orbit experience. The PeruSAT-1, a very high-resolution Earth observation satellite system, was built for the government and Space Agency of Peru, which provides high-quality imagery for both civil and military applications.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 17.8% from that reported in 2022.L3Harris is the prime contractor of Navigation Technology Satellite – 3 (NTS-3). The NTS-3, to be launched later this year, will provide for the safety and success of the warfighters with its accurate and uninterrupted positioning, navigation and timing technology. The company is expanding its satellite production site to include advanced production of unclassified satellites, which will deliver experimental capabilities for national defense.LHX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for L3Harris’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 8.9% from that reported in 2022.Northrop Grumman's deep mission expertise gives it an edge in knowing what it takes to protect the warfighter, both in space and from space.  In August 2023, NOC was selected by SDA to design and build 36 data transport satellites, the first space vehicles in the latest generation of its low-Earth orbit Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 5.6% from that reported in 2022.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past year, shares of LMT have gained 1.5% against the industry’s 6.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Part of this revision stems from a pushout in the expected start for Lockheed delivering its F-35 Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) to sometime between April-June 2024 instead of later this year. While Lockheed doesn't think this will have a material impact on its 2023 guidance, our thinking is the number of F-35s delivered in 2024 will hinge on when Lockheed begins shipping TR-3, suggesting we are likely to see downside guidance relative to current consensus expectations.Continue reading]"

These efficiencies will lead to improved sensors for the jet, as well as the capability to transport an increased number of long-range precision munitions, enhanced data integration, heightened compatibility with other systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare capabilities.Considering the aforementioned discussion, once the TR-3-upgraded F-35 jets are delivered, LMT will gain financially in terms of solid revenues. However, the company currently expects a delay in the process of this technology upgrade, which has resultantly shifted the first jet delivery with the TR-3 upgrade from 2023 to a period between April and June 2024. This has led Lockheed to trim its F-35 delivery numbers for 2023. Growth ProspectsLMT’s management believes that this reduced delivery outlook for F-35 jets will not have any material impact on its 2023 financial guidance. Moreover, the company continues to manufacture F-35 aircraft at a rate of 156 per year and expects to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR-3 software development and testing.Story continuesThis, along with the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 F-35 aircraft, reflects the solid demand Lockheed Martin continues to enjoy for this stealth jet. This can be expected to boost its revenue growth prospects in the coming years.Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions worldwide, the successful integration and timely delivery of TR-3 upgraded F-35 jets can be projected to boost the demand for this lethal combat aircraft even more in the days ahead, thereby bolstering LMT’s top line.Peers to BenefitOther defense companies that play a significant role in manufacturing the F-35 jet and thus are likely to enjoy the perks of the increased demand for F-35 aircraft are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop Grumman supplies many key technologies for the F-35 jet like the AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radar, center fuselage, AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System as well as mission systems and mission-planning software. It also provides sustainment and modernization support to F-35 users.The long-term earnings growth rate of NOC stands at 4.1%. The consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s 2023 sales indicates a growth rate of 5.6% from the prior-year reported figure.RTX Corporation RTX: Its business unit, Pratt &amp; Whitney, has been manufacturing and sustaining the F135 engine for the F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft. Moreover, RTX’s combat-proven Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile air-to-air missile has been integrated into F-35 jets, making it a more lethal combat aircraft.RTX Corporation has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 9.9% from the prior-year reported figure.BAE Systems plc BAESY: The company provides the Vehicle Management Computer, the electronic warfare system, the active inceptor control system and the aft fuselage for every F-35 at manufacturing facilities. BAESY also delivers sustainability, technical support and training services to keep F-35s mission-ready.It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2023 sales implies a growth rate of 15.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have increased 0.8% against the industry’s fall of 4.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

This sparks a pertinent question: is Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) modestly undervalued? Our valuation analysis aims to answer this question. Read on for an in-depth exploration of Johnson &amp; Johnson's intrinsic value.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ROL. Click here to check it out. JNJ 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson, the world's largest and most diverse healthcare firm, operates through three divisions: pharmaceutical, medical devices and diagnostics, and consumer. The drug and device groups contribute close to 80% of sales and drive the majority of the firm's cash flows. The consumer group, focusing on baby care, beauty, oral care, over-the-counter drugs, and women's health, is set to be divested in 2023 under the new name Kenvue. Geographically, just over half of the total revenue is generated in the United States.Comparing Johnson &amp; Johnson's stock price of $160.5 with its fair value (GF Value) of $179.74, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Here's a snapshot of the company's income breakdown:Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ): A Modestly Undervalued Gem?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates a stock's intrinsic value, considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to our valuation method, Johnson &amp; Johnson's stock appears to be modestly undervalued. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued, indicating poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, it may be undervalued, suggesting higher future returns. Considering Johnson &amp; Johnson's current price of $160.5 per share, the stock seems to be modestly undervalued. This suggests that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesJohnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ): A Modestly Undervalued Gem?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Johnson &amp; Johnson has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.63, which ranks worse than 56.1% of 1050 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Johnson &amp; Johnson's financial strength as 7 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ): A Modestly Undervalued Gem?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is generally less risky. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been profitable for 10 of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $97.80 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.94. Its operating margin is 25.5%, which ranks better than 91.19% of 1033 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Overall, Johnson &amp; Johnson's profitability is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. If a company's business is growing, it usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Conversely, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Johnson &amp; Johnson's 3-year average revenue growth rate is worse than 52.74% of 912 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry. Johnson &amp; Johnson's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 5.8%, which ranks worse than 57.78% of 881 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Johnson &amp; Johnson's ROIC is 14.82, and its WACC is 6.05.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ): A Modestly Undervalued Gem?ConclusionIn conclusion, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks worse than 57.78% of 881 companies in the Drug Manufacturers industry.

PAH means there is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.J&amp;J entered the PAH drugs category with the 2017 acquisition of Actelion. J&amp;J’s another key PAH drug is Uptravi. J&amp;J is also conducting a phase III study (UNISUS) to demonstrate the superiority of a 75 mg dose of Opsumit over the currently marketed 10 mg dose.In addition, J&amp;J’s new drug application seeking approval for the single tablet combination therapy of macitentan and tadalafil for long-term treatment of PAH is under review in the United States and EU. The regulatory applications were based on positive data from J&amp;J’s phase III A DUE study.J&amp;J’s stock has declined 10.6% so far this year against an increase of 6.5% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research In a separate press release, J&amp;J announced positive top-line data from a phase III study evaluating regimens based on its new cancer drug, Rybrevant, in the broader EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) population,The study, called MARIPOSA-2, evaluated Rybrevant plus chemotherapy with and without lazertinib versus chemotherapy alone in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC after disease progression on osimertinib. The study met its dual primary endpoint, resulting in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus chemotherapy alone in both experimental treatment arms.Story continuesRybrevant is presently approved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations whose disease progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.Another phase III study called PAPILLON has earlier demonstrated the potential of Rybrevant to improve outcomes in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. PAPILLON evaluated Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) in patients with newly diagnosed advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.Last month, J&amp;J filed a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) to the FDA seeking approval of Rybrevant in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations based on data from the PAPILLON study.Rybrevant is being evaluated in multiple clinical studies in NSCLC, including the pivotal phase III study called MARIPOSA, which is evaluating Rybrevant and lazertinib for first-line EGFR-mutated NSCLC.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderJ&amp;J currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Johnson &amp; Johnson Price and ConsensusJohnson &amp; Johnson Price and ConsensusJohnson &amp; Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson &amp; Johnson Quote Some better-ranked biotech companies are Exelixis EXEL, Dynavax Technologies Corporation DVAX and Corcept Therapeutics CORT, each carrying a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) at present.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Skyworks Solutions'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Skyworks Solutions How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Skyworks Solutions is:18% = US$1.0b ÷ US$5.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.18 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Skyworks Solutions' Earnings Growth And 18% ROETo start with, Skyworks Solutions' ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 15%. Consequently, this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 7.5% seen over the past five years by Skyworks Solutions.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Skyworks Solutions' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 31% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for SWKS?

183,f88955fa-3f26-315d-a4c8-71a75f6f29b5,SWKS,2023-09-08,Apple stock falls on reports Chinese govt. banning iPhone use for officials,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-stock-falls-reports-chinese-143258828.html,1694097178,VIDEO,"['MSFT', 'SWKS', 'AMZN', 'QCOM', 'AAPL', 'META']","[Apple (AAPL) shares are falling for a second day following a Bloomberg report that China could ban some state firms from using iPhones. It follows a similar report from the Wall Street Journal that the country is banning government officials from using iPhones at work. Yahoo Finance Senior Tech Editor Dan Howley explains that, given how Apple has worked with the Chinese government to satiate some of their security concerns, this seems to almost be more of ""a delayed tit for tat for what the U.S. has done to the likes of Huawei and is doing to TikTok."" Howley also explains how Apple is putting more emphasis on India in terms of both manufacturing and an opportunity for growth.Howley also highlights the impending impact of the European Union's Digital Markets Act, which will disrupt Apple's App Store model, and affect other tech giants like Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN).Video Transcript- Shares of Apple are lower this morning on reports that China's iPhone ban is broadening across government firms. Staff at several Chinese agencies say that they were given instructions not to use Apple's iPhones or other foreign devices in the office, first reported by the Wall Street Journal. China is one of the tech giant's biggest markets, accounting for just under 19% of its overall revenue.Beijing has already limited government officials from using iPhones. But this new report would significantly broaden that ban and signal perhaps a sharper crackdown on existing rules. Apple suppliers, like Qualcomm and Skyworks, are also taking a hit on news. Joining us now with more, we've got Yahoo Finance's own Dan Howley, our tech DH. So Dan, what do we know about this so far?DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, this is something that we've kind of seen expand quickly over the past few days about Chinese officials banning or potentially banning. We don't know anything concrete quite yet, how far this goes, what this exactly means for Apple. It does seem as though it's kind of not necessarily a tit for tat because the ban on Huawei, the ban on TikTok with regards to official uses in the US government, I mean, across state governments. Some universities have banned the use of TikTok on their networks.Story continuesSo it seems as though it's almost a response to that. But also, perhaps, for the Chinese government side, a way of keeping themselves insulated from any potential hacking. Now, the thing to remember about Apple is their whole MO outside of selling the iPhone is, and has been for a while now, privacy.And so they've worked with the Chinese government to their detriment in some instances, where they've limited the window that airdrop is available, something that they don't do in other areas. They've taken down apps at the request of the Chinese government. Data that's stored-- or Chinese user data is stored in China. So it's not something where there's a general distrust seemingly for Apple.Tim Cook has gone there several times to basically chat with officials. So it doesn't seem as though Apple has necessarily done anything. This seems to be more of, as I said, almost a delayed tit for tat for what the US has done to the likes of Huawei and is doing to TikTok.So I think the important thing to point out is this is only officials. It's not the general public, although obviously, this can rile up some nationalist fervor. People might go out and decide that they need to buy China-made devices rather than Apple devices, and that occurs every once in a while.But I just want to point out the amount of spending from Chinese consumers relative to Apple's overall revenue. So in 2022, Apple had 900-- sorry $394 billion in revenue. Of that, $74.2 billion for the iPhone side came from greater China. And that's just a number that's been increasing over the years.And so you can see how much of an impact this would have. It's one of their biggest markets, one of their most important markets. And they frequently reference it as an area where they're getting switchers from Android to iOS and the fact that they're able to get folks onto the App Store. So getting them into the ecosystem is all part of the broader plan. So it's not a message that consumers will be impacted, but there's a good number of government officials.- Well, and now, according to this latest report, it's perhaps expanded to state-owned enterprises. So if you're talking about a PetroChina, which is a huge company, and the other Chinese state-owned enterprises that have a lot of employees, if they're not allowed to have an iPhone-- and it doesn't seem like there's anything in writing. This is not an official position.Reportedly, it's sort of a soft position. But what's really remarkable about this that you alluded to is that Apple has had quite a close relationship with the Chinese government, whereas a lot of the anti-China policy coming from the US. Like Huawei is not sitting down with the Biden administration, for example. So that-- it feels different than some of the moves that we have seen in the past.DAN HOWLEY: It seems almost strange for it to also come out at this point.- Right ahead of the product announcement from Apple.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah. That seems kind of timed purposefully, considering that next week, we're expected to get the new iPhone, the new Apple Watch, and so forth. I think that's something that was purposeful. But yeah, I mean, it just seems to be an odd move for them to target Apple. Maybe it's a message to the US that seems is to be part of it saying, look, we'll go after your biggest companies, and it won't be a problem for us. So that could be it.I also do want to point out, though, as important as China is to Apple's overall revenue, they are increasingly putting more emphasis on India as their next--- In terms of manufacturing or also in terms of an end market?DAN HOWLEY: Both.- Both.DAN HOWLEY: So they're moving there as far as manufacturing. They have for a while, but now, as an end market, they repeatedly referenced that. I think in the last earnings call, they specifically pointed to India as a place where they're getting more switchers. So it's an opportunity for them to grow.This is the kind of conversation they were having about China years and years ago. So it's basically, OK, part two of their expansion outside of the US and Europe, going, OK, we exploded in China. We're doing well there. They clearly hope that continues barring any of this.But India is now kind of their big opportunity to grow. And so it's still dangerous for them to lose, obviously, anything in China, but it's also-- they're moving on to India, as well.- Well, Apple also facing some hurdles elsewhere in Europe, as well. Tell us about the Digital Markets Act, a little bit about this came out yesterday early in the morning, and what that means for big tech and the future of big tech in the EU, particularly.DAN HOWLEY: Yeah, so the Digital Markets Act is basically going to append Apple's App store, as well as Google's Play Store. It's basically a means to ensure-- at least for those two companies, and obviously, we have the other companies here that are going to be listed. They're basically going to be kind of gatekeepers to different parts of businesses. So to-- according to the EU, to ensure the ability for smaller companies to compete.What they're going to be doing is opening up or force them to open up their app stores, meaning you're not just going to have the standard App Store on your iPhone, on your iPad. You're going to have to allow a third party App Store to get in there and ensure that other companies can provide their apps. And so Google does this in a roundabout way with Android.They allow you to sideload, although they put all these scary warnings in the way. And to a degree, it is also dangerous because it's not-- they're generally not as well vetted as you might see apps on the App Store or in the Google Play store. But for Apple, it's a bigger deal because more people purchase apps on the App Store.Generally, iPhone owners are more affluent, so they're going to be spending more on whatever, Fortnite Bucks or whatever they're buying in there. And so the idea that they're going to have to open this up means they may end up losing revenue. The biggest share of revenue that they get from the App Store, by the way, is from games.And if they're opening up to other game developers, app stores, those people can then sell Fortnite Bucks for less, V-Bucks, whatever they're called. Then that's going to eat into Apple's margins for their services division. So it's going to be a big deal.How they go about zhuzhing this remains to be seen. But if they do it in the EU, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll do it globally, especially if it means taking a big chunk out of their overall revenue.- We'll see. And there's, of course, been some legal wrangling over that here in the US. So we'll talk more about that next time we talk about this. Thanks so much, Dan Howley. Good to see you.]"

This launch should further strengthen Lockheed Martin’s position in the space satellite market.Lockheed’s Place in Satellite MarketSDA’s Transport Layer aims to provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to the full range of warfighter platforms. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the satellites that Lockheed launched recently come with LMT’s SmartSat software, which makes it easier to dynamically add and quickly change missions in orbit through simple app uploads.The satellites also host Link-16 radios, which enable sensor-to-shooter targeting by connecting systems that include fighter aircraft and Integrated Air and Missile Defense networks. This, in turn, will modernize the United States’ current capabilities to better support warfighter needs to act timely against threat warnings and provide situational awareness information across the range of military operations.Such benefits offered by Lockheed’s satellites must have enabled the company to win the contract of building 36 Tranche 2 Transport Layer Beta satellites in August 2023 from the SDA. LMT is also producing 42 satellites for SDA's Tranche 1 Transport Layer, to be launched in 2024. Further, the company recently opened a satellite processing center to efficiently assemble, integrate and test these satellites.These developments reflect the solid demand that Lockheed enjoys in the space surveillance market, with space-based assets being increasingly used in defending a nation against hostile attacks.Growth ProspectsPer a report by the Research And Markets firm, the global military satellites market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2023-2027 period. This should benefit Lockheed Martin, which provides national security space capabilities.A few other defense players that can gain from the expanding military satellite market are Airbus SE EADSY, L3Harris Technologies Inc. LHX and Northrop Grumman Inc. NOC.   Airbus’ Defense and Space unit has delivered more than 70 Earth observation satellite systems, accumulating close to 600 years of in-orbit experience. The PeruSAT-1, a very high-resolution Earth observation satellite system, was built for the government and Space Agency of Peru, which provides high-quality imagery for both civil and military applications.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 17.8% from that reported in 2022.L3Harris is the prime contractor of Navigation Technology Satellite – 3 (NTS-3). The NTS-3, to be launched later this year, will provide for the safety and success of the warfighters with its accurate and uninterrupted positioning, navigation and timing technology. The company is expanding its satellite production site to include advanced production of unclassified satellites, which will deliver experimental capabilities for national defense.LHX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for L3Harris’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 8.9% from that reported in 2022.Northrop Grumman's deep mission expertise gives it an edge in knowing what it takes to protect the warfighter, both in space and from space.  In August 2023, NOC was selected by SDA to design and build 36 data transport satellites, the first space vehicles in the latest generation of its low-Earth orbit Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 5.6% from that reported in 2022.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past year, shares of LMT have gained 1.5% against the industry’s 6.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These efficiencies will lead to improved sensors for the jet, as well as the capability to transport an increased number of long-range precision munitions, enhanced data integration, heightened compatibility with other systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare capabilities.Considering the aforementioned discussion, once the TR-3-upgraded F-35 jets are delivered, LMT will gain financially in terms of solid revenues. However, the company currently expects a delay in the process of this technology upgrade, which has resultantly shifted the first jet delivery with the TR-3 upgrade from 2023 to a period between April and June 2024. This has led Lockheed to trim its F-35 delivery numbers for 2023. Growth ProspectsLMT’s management believes that this reduced delivery outlook for F-35 jets will not have any material impact on its 2023 financial guidance. Moreover, the company continues to manufacture F-35 aircraft at a rate of 156 per year and expects to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR-3 software development and testing.Story continuesThis, along with the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 F-35 aircraft, reflects the solid demand Lockheed Martin continues to enjoy for this stealth jet. This can be expected to boost its revenue growth prospects in the coming years.Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions worldwide, the successful integration and timely delivery of TR-3 upgraded F-35 jets can be projected to boost the demand for this lethal combat aircraft even more in the days ahead, thereby bolstering LMT’s top line.Peers to BenefitOther defense companies that play a significant role in manufacturing the F-35 jet and thus are likely to enjoy the perks of the increased demand for F-35 aircraft are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop Grumman supplies many key technologies for the F-35 jet like the AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radar, center fuselage, AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System as well as mission systems and mission-planning software. It also provides sustainment and modernization support to F-35 users.The long-term earnings growth rate of NOC stands at 4.1%. The consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s 2023 sales indicates a growth rate of 5.6% from the prior-year reported figure.RTX Corporation RTX: Its business unit, Pratt &amp; Whitney, has been manufacturing and sustaining the F135 engine for the F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft. Moreover, RTX’s combat-proven Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile air-to-air missile has been integrated into F-35 jets, making it a more lethal combat aircraft.RTX Corporation has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 9.9% from the prior-year reported figure.BAE Systems plc BAESY: The company provides the Vehicle Management Computer, the electronic warfare system, the active inceptor control system and the aft fuselage for every F-35 at manufacturing facilities. BAESY also delivers sustainability, technical support and training services to keep F-35s mission-ready.It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2023 sales implies a growth rate of 15.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have increased 0.8% against the industry’s fall of 4.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Now let me turn the call over to Doug.Douglas M. HoweGood morning, everyone. Before discussing this quarter's performance, I want to thank our team for their dedication and hard work during the quarter that played out against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Because of our team's commitment to improving results, I am pleased to share that we posted overall comps that improved throughout the quarter in addition to posting sequential improvement from the first quarter. Our gross margin also increased year-over-year as well as sequentially and marked the second-highest Q2 rate over the past decade. Sequential improvement alone though, is not enough. Within our organization, we are committed to producing year-over-year growth across our top and bottom lines. As we work towards achieving that goal consistently, I'm pleased with our team's efforts to continue reading and reacting to a highly promotional environment while simultaneously managing our inventory to an appropriate healthy level in both our Retail and Brand segments. We are also showcasing consistent operational progress. From an own brand perspective, we are very excited to have launched a completely new athleisure brand, Le Tigre, in the first month of Q3, and we are rolling out new collaborations as we diversify and strengthen our portfolio, which will drive our profitability over the longer term. I also want to take a moment to highlight a very important hire we made during the month of July. I'm thrilled to announce that Laura Denk has been brought on board as the new President of Designer Shoe Warehouse. Laura joins us with an incredible resume that includes time at Macy's, Claire's and Michaels Stores, most recently as Michael's Chief Merchandising Officer. Laura will bring her extensive merchandising background, ability to forge strong vendor partnerships, knowledge of augmenting customer experiences and, importantly, positioning and elevating owned and national brands within our DSW specific channels. With her leadership, we'll be growing our credibility as an on-trend brand builder and retailer. This will help us drive the next phase of growth and will allow me more time to focus on DBI's overall strategic priorities, including driving our own brand's performance, both inside and outside of the DSW. Please join me in welcoming Laura. I recently hit the 100-day mark in my new seat as DBI's CEO, and I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress we've made and the actions we are taking to ensure we are well positioned for our next phase of growth. It has become increasingly clear to me that we have 2 distinct and valuable businesses, our legacy Retail business and our new and growing Brands business. Combined, they give us distinctive synergies that do not exist elsewhere in the industry. Laura's hire follows the organizational realignments we instituted a few months ago, which aim to align our talent and resources more closely with the needs of our different businesses, while setting the foundation for strong strategic growth. Additionally, we recently announced that Bill Jordan will be stepping down from the business. With this change, we intend to hire a seasoned brand builder to help lead our growing Brands business. We are immensely thankful for the work Bill has led to help made Designer Brands what it is today and wish him the very best. Designer Brands truly has unlike any other company in the footwear industry, and I firmly believe we have unique advantages that will deliver strategic growth into the future. Turning to our quarter's results. In the second quarter, Designer Brands net sales declined 7.8% compared to the second quarter of last year but improved 290 basis points versus the first quarter decline, driven by increasing strength in our casual offerings. Total retail comps were down 8.9%, while wholesale net sales were up roughly 20% versus last year as we integrate the Keds and Topo Athletic brands and launch our newest brand, La TIGRE. Our long-term strategy of doubling sales of our own brands from 2021 to 2026 remains the top priority, and we continue to move full speed ahead on our journey. Year-to-date through the second quarter, our own brands' penetration, including wholesale sales, increased year-over-year by 60 basis points to 25% of total DBI revenue. This progress has continued into the third quarter. We are thrilled with the recent launch of La TIGRE. We are equally proud that Topo Athletic has seen steady growth and continues to meet our expectations in terms of performance. We are also excited to continue building our success with Hush Puppies as we have now become the exclusive licensee in the U.S. and Canada, including new DTC channels and international expansion. Ranked 5th by people.com for the hottest fashion launches you need to shop for this summer, on August 1, La TIGRE launched as our newest brand. And as of 8/14, customers were able to buy the brand at DSW. As a reminder, La TIGRE is new to the footwear space, and we are thrilled their inaugural athletic cap leisure year launch is with us. The La TIGRE brand was established in 1977, rooted in New York City street culture and Timeless style, and we are bringing the ""Born in the city. Raised in the wild. Ready for anything."" spirit to this new collection. Their footwear line includes both women's and men's selections inspired by vintage athletic design and loaded with modern day comfort. I couldn't be more excited about the work and the strategic approach that has gone into this launch, our first ever launch of a new national brand. Turning to Hush Puppies. We recently signed an agreement to become the exclusive licensee of the brand in the U.S. and Canada. This was highly informed by the special relationship DSW already had with Wolverine related to exclusive U.S. distribution and is a stellar expansion to our comfort and casual categories and owned brands. Now as the official licensee, we'll take over the hushpuppies.com business, which will be our sixth independent e-commerce site, and we will have the ability to wholesale the brands in North America. Hush Puppies growth within DSW has been robust, up nearly 60% in the quarter versus last year, driven by men's with growth across casual, dress and boots. Excitingly, our first product expression is anticipated for spring of 2024. Returning to our progress in the quarter. At Keds, our integration continues to advance as expected. We also launched exciting collaborations in the quarter, both with Recreational Habits and [Star]. First, our Recreational Habits partnership produced a sophisticated take on the court sneaker in classic white and gray color lace. Complementary to this, our Star launch is designed to cater to the latest pick of all craze and court sport enthusiasts. We've implemented marketing activations at facts complemented by a robust influencer and digital campaign. As part of this launch, we excited customers with an actual pick-of-all top-up court inside of Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York during July. As part of our exclusive launch, the product was initially available only through Saks Fifth Avenue and Star channels. And later this month, we are bringing the hike in-house to be hosted exclusively on keds.com beginning on September 22. At Crown Vintage, Emma Roberts' first curated collection, Emma [6] launched during the quarter. This included engaging video content on dsw.com, which drove positive customer interactions and buzz. We also have new content coming with Emma in October around seasonal boots and booties. This long-term partnership continues to strengthen our brand positioning and relevance with our Crown Vintage target customer. Vince Camuto, we're pleased to have launched our first men's franchise shoe line, Fly365, address meets casual style hybrid shoe selection. As we build out this franchise, what sets this line apart from the rest of the path is the use of special technologies and production, not often found in nonathletic men's shoes, including features like a supportive cupsole for stability, a cushioned lightweight midsole for weight reduction and energy return and a rubber outsole for traction and durability. We have merged the European Inspire Vince Camuto aesthetic with technical comfort innovation to target the modern male customer who is less likely to compromise on comfort in this post-COVID world. In fact, 365 was recently highlighted in Footwear News. Growing our men's business across all of DBI remains one of our largest white space opportunities and we believe represents a significant growth lever over the long term. We believe that our new offerings from Vince Camuto and La TIGRE will help us gain traction with male customers that are increasingly prioritizing the unification of comfort and style. Our continued success was evident in our Q2 results, where we saw Vince Camuto men's sales up 95% in dot-com. We are also committed to strengthening our relationships and expanding our business with the national brands that are most relevant to our customers. This strategy remains on track as we continue leveraging our position as the top point of distribution. As part of our edit-and-amplify strategy, we continue to be excited with our Nike partnership that we announced last quarter. We will leverage this relationship to provide an athletic offering across men's, women's and kids, giving our customers an elevated physical and digital assortment. Finally, we continue to be more cognizant of providing increased value to our customers. One of our greatest strengths is our long-standing vendor relationships and associated opportunistic closeout buys with large national brands. As such, as part of our long-term relationship with Wolverine, we executed an advantageous buy that provided us with an opportunity to offer compelling savings to our customers on Sperry, Saucony, Merrell and Chaco products in the quarter. We look forward to offering additional events for our customers in the fall. Before I hand it over to Jared, I'm going to quickly speak to our full year outlook. Although we anticipate macro pressures will continue through the end of the year and in fact, have the potential to increase, today, we reaffirmed our full year 2023 guidance, supported by the sequential improvement we saw from Q1 into Q2. We still have our Septober and holiday selling seasons ahead of us, and we continue to be laser-focused on meeting and driving demand with on-trend products. Jared will go into more detail on this in a few moments. As we move forward, we continue to prioritize value-creating opportunities and are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In fact, year-to-date, through September 5, Designer Brands has returned $91.1 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. I'll let Jared speak more on our strategic capital allocation plans for the back half of fiscal '23. I look forward to updating you all on our strategic initiatives as we move through the back half of the year. With that, I'll pass it over to Jared. Jared?Story continuesJared A. PoffThank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate Doug's comments and say how excited I am to welcome Laura Denk as our new President of DSW. She will be a tremendous asset in driving our strategic vision for our DSW business, focusing on tactical merchandising, marketing and our overall experience, all of which will be anchored to our current and target customers. We believe that there is meaningful growth to be had at DSW and that Laura's leadership will help us unlock that growth. I share Doug's feeling of pride in our organization and this team's ability to continue managing through the increasingly challenging current environment, allowing us to deliver a second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.59, in line with our expectations. We saw a sequential improvement over the first quarter in both our sales and gross margin. And as a result, we are reaffirming our current full year guidance despite continued industry and macro headwinds. Now let me provide a bit more detail on our financial results. For the second quarter, sales decreased 7.8% from last year to $792.2 million and an improvement from the first quarter's results. The continued pressure on consumers, high inventory across the industry and an extremely promotional retail environment, all contributed to this decrease. From a wholesale perspective, sales were up roughly 20%, driven by the acquisition of Keds, our launch of La TIGRE and acquisition of Topo Athletic. In our Retail segments, total retail comps were down 8.9% compared to last year, but improved sequentially from the first quarter. U.S. retail costs specifically were down 9.2% in the quarter, but also sequentially improved from a pressured Q1. While Canada posted comps down 7.3% in the quarter, this was on top of a very strong post-COVID recovery comp of just over 47% in the second quarter of 2022. We remain pleased with the results we are seeing at vincecamuto.com, one of our premier DEC channels, with comps up 50 basis points on top of roughly 43% comp last year. Consolidated gross margin was 34.5% in the second quarter compared to 34.4% last year, an increase of 10 basis points and a sequential improvement of 250 basis points versus last quarter. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by lower markdowns. Importantly, our gross margin continues to be fundamentally strong with consolidated gross margin up 400 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019. Year-over-year profitability improvement was also driven by consolidation of our fulfillment centers and significantly lower logistics costs, including freight, shipping and distribution expense. The impact of consolidating our fulfillment centers, specifically the Columbus fulfillment center into the New Jersey ECLC, allowed us to achieve a more favorable level of fixed and variable expense leverage. This benefit was partially offset by increased promotions, the continued rebuilding of our clearance business and deleverage of our fixed store occupancy cost. Our adjusted SG&amp;A ratio for the second quarter was 26.9% of sales compared to 26.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Although we are experiencing modest deleverage given our current retail cost performance, we saw sequential improvement from a dollar and rate perspective versus first quarter. Going forward, increased marketing investment to build brand equity and maintain customer awareness could put pressure on sustaining this ratio. This trend may see volatility as we continue rolling out our new DTC sites and execute other strategic initiatives, but we will continue to pursue opportunities to trim costs across the entire business. For the second quarter, adjusted operating profit was 7.9% of sales compared to 8.2% in the prior year and sequentially improved from 3.5% in the first quarter of 2023. In the second quarter, we had $6.9 million of net interest expense and our effective tax rate on our adjusted results was 29.3% compared to 31.8% last year. Finally, our second quarter adjusted net income was $39.4 million or $0.59 diluted EPS versus $46.1 million or $0.62 last year, and $35.8 million or $0.48 in 2019. We ended the second quarter with inventories of $606.8 million, down roughly 13% compared to $694 million last year and down sequentially from $637.4 million in the first quarter. On a retail inventory square footage basis, we ended down 10% versus the second quarter of 2022 and down 4% compared to Q1 of 2023. Wholesale inventory ended the second quarter down 10% and, adjusted for the acquisition of Topo and Keds, inventory would have been down 33% when compared to last year. Because we have remained nimble in our approach to our assortment, we feel good about our inventory positioning heading into fall, ensuring we have the flexibility necessary to chase and take action on opportunistic buys. As a reminder, at the end of the last quarter, we announced the commencement of our Dutch auction tender offer, which allowed us to invest in our own stock. In mid-July, we announced the final results of the offer, which included repurchasing $14.7 million of our Class A common stock at a price of $10 per share under our existing Board-approved share repurchase program. As always, we maintain an ongoing dialogue between management and our Board of Directors on our capital allocation strategy. Together, we continue to believe that our most prudent use of capital at this time is to return it to our shareholders. As a result, we have continued to purchase shares in the open market. We view this as a vote of confidence in our long-term strategy. In the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2023, based on trading date, we returned $32.9 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Thus far in the third quarter, we have added to that total by $58.3 million through September 5, thanks to the continued open market repurchases. We ended the quarter with $46.2 million of cash and our total liquidity, which includes cash and availability under our revolver of $279.9 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had $233.7 million available to draw on our revolving credit facility. However, given the share repurchase activity mentioned previously that has occurred since the end of the second quarter, our current availability to draw on our revolving credit facility was $227.9 million as of 9/5/2023. As a reminder, to help fund our capital allocation priorities, we previously announced that we had entered into a 5-year term loan. Upon closing that facility on June 23, 2023, we immediately drew $50 million under the term loan and anticipate drawing the additional $85 million throughout the course of the year. The proceeds of that subsequent draw will immediately be used to pay down outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility. We continue to await the receipt of the remaining $40 million of our CARES Act tax refund due to us from the IRS. We are happy to report that the IRS has formally closed our standard audit for which this refund applies with no adjustments. And as such, we are now simply waiting on the refund request to work its way through the appropriate approval channels at the IRS and Treasury Department for ultimate funding. Before I conclude, I want to share a few remarks on our current guidance. As discussed last quarter, our updated guidance assumes the continued pullback in consumer spending with a recovery delayed until later in the year. Consistent with prior views, the largest uncertainty continues to lie squarely with the discretionary consumer while also contemplating a multitude of other pressures, including competitive inventory, the health of the consumer and overall macroeconomic headwinds. Our current guidance assumes that our retail comp performance improves throughout the balance of the year as the macro pressures on the consumer begin to subside and as our prior year comparables become wider. That being said, pressures continue to weigh on the consumer, and therefore, potential for headwinds to worsen remains. I do want to cover a few updates within our assumptions. With the previously discussed repurchase activity, our share count is now expected to be approximately 64 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023. With the new term loan, interest expense is now expected to be approximately $35 million for the full year. Thus, the incremental interest of the term loan essentially offsets the benefit of the lower weighted average outstanding share count for our fiscal 2023 EPS figure. Additionally, our estimated tax rate is anticipated to be 30%. With all of this in mind, and given the sequential improvement seen in our most recent quarter in terms of sales and margins, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 EPS guidance range of $1.20 to $1.50. As Doug noted, we have made incredible progress in our evolution as a company, including recent leadership hires, launches of new brands, growing with existing brand partners and accelerating our journey as a brand builder. I have strong conviction in our path forward. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Gaby Carbone with Deutsche Bank.Gabriella Olivia CarboneSo first, I was wondering if you could maybe discuss the changes you saw in category performance, if any, from 2Q versus 1Q? And then as we look to the fall season, obviously, the boot category becomes quite important. Just curious how you're thinking about inventory there.Douglas M. HoweYes. Thanks, Gaby. This is Doug. There's really 2 category performance today. We continue to see buoyancy in the casual category. Obviously, the casualization trend just continues to gain momentum and (inaudible) of that with managing the inventory. So again, we feel really good about that business in particular. To your point, you know we have a dominant penetration in the boot category. It's very, very early on. We talked a lot about Septober, which is the key time for boot selling. So I think the majority of that season is ahead of us honestly. We are seeing some nice initial results on fashion goods, particularly driven by Western, so we're cautiously optimistic about that. But again, the majority of the season is still ahead of us.Gabriella Olivia CarboneGot it. And if I could just sneak in one more. So moving ahead, obviously, it's been promotional out there. Curious, just what's kind of baked into your guidance on the promotion front. And then are there certain categories you're seeing more promotional activity in? And then you mentioned that like you're still seeing high inventory levels across the marketplace. So curious if you have any view when maybe you think the marketplace will be a bit more clean?Douglas M. HoweYes. Good question. Yes, we've obviously done a really strong job of managing our margin and largely that is fueled by the fact that our inventory is in really good shape, so we didn't feel the need to get overly promotional. We are seeing the landscape improvement as we move through the back half, particularly in the athletic category. I think we'll start to see that inventory start to normalize, which hopefully will allow us to be less promotional. So we're staying very close to that. But as you said, it's a choppy macroeconomic environment out there. So we'll definitely stay close to it.Operator(Operator Instructions) Today's next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS.Mauricio Serna VegaGreat. First, I wanted to ask if you could provide maybe some color on what you see on quarter-to-date performance. Have you seen any (inaudible) versus Q2? And if we think about second half, should we -- do you see like any big difference between the sales growth in Q3 and Q4? Then just on the margins, you talked about SG&amp;A, probably the SG&amp;A rate probably being a little bit more pressured because of the marketing and the launching of the website. So does that mean that SG&amp;A dollar growth will accelerate in the second half? Or how should we think about that? And then just lastly, on the balance sheet, very encouraging to see all the buybacks continuing in Q3. Is there like a potential for even more given how there's also the higher leverage on the balance sheet at this point?Douglas M. HoweYes. Thanks, Mauricio. This is Doug. There's a lot to unpack there. I think you had 4 questions. So I'll take the first 2 on the current performance and then Q3 and Q4. And I'll hand it over to Jared to speak to SG&amp;A and the balance of the year. As you know, we don't comment on sales in the current quarter. Having said that, we haven't seen anything that would lead us to change our guidance, which is why we're maintaining our outlook. We think about sales growth in Q3 and Q4 definitely a tailwind, we feel, certainly, as regards to we're up against softer comps in Q3 and most notably in Q4. Nice tailwinds are our fall campaign that we're going to be kicking off at DSW to really focus on bringing awareness, which we're optimistic about. And then secondly, as we shared last quarter, the return of Nike, we are very excited about continuing to elevate that partnership. So again, those are 2 tailwinds. But again, as we navigate through a choppy macroeconomic environment, we're balancing, obviously, those tailwinds with those headwinds.Jared A. PoffAnd I want to echo one thing that Doug had said to make sure it's clear, and we've reiterated this a few times. In our current guidance, which we reaffirmed, we are assuming there is a pretty material change in the current trajectory that we've experienced year-to-date. That's always been the case, and we believe, especially as we get against easier comps, but that is why we have belief, to date, we have not seen that, but we haven't planned to see that yet, but that is what is anticipated, but that is why we called out. There is certainly, I would say, a net risk position as it pertains to the macroeconomic conditions and turning -- seeing that turn to the degree that our current guidance has in there. But for now, it is on trend and that's why we've reaffirmed guidance. To your last 2 questions on the SG&amp;A rate, I'm actually very glad you spoke or asked about that because in my mind, that's right now where the consensus modeling is probably most disconnected for the fall. I want to take you back to a moment to our initial guidance for SG&amp;A for the year. And what we had said was that we have done the reorg that we talked about and some cost-savings initiatives that stripped about $25 million year-over-year out of our legacy business. But we also have about $50 million of SG&amp;A to add into the overall company because of Keds, Topo and the 53rd week. And right now, I'm not seeing consensus reflect that on a total year basis. In fact, it's looking like most consensus has that SG&amp;A dollars below LY. So I think that's one of the biggest disconnects that are currently out there in consensus. So that and the new interest within the loan, I want to call you back to that which I gave guidance to. If we look at a change in SG&amp;A dollars, spring to fall, there's about a $40 million shift to kind of get to what I just talked about our full year guidance. That's coming from a few big buckets of work. One, we've got marketing. We shifted about $15 million of marketing across the company out of spring into fall as we were not seeing the traction or the incremental traction that we would have expected to see with that marketing. And so we've moved that into fall. We used some of that for back-to-school. And we're very excited to be launching for the first time in a long time some DSW branding top of funnel marketing, very video heavy in the fall as well. So that shift has moved.We also have about $9 million of that 53rd week that's being added in there. So again, that's unique to fall, not happening in spring. And then about $4 million related to coming off the TSA with our Keds transition.That has always been the case. We just weren't sure when that was going to materialize. That final month, we have a month of catch-up to do, and that happens to be in Q3. So all of that together, along with selling expenses related to an improvement in our comp performance totals about a $40 million shift in SG&amp;A between fall versus spring and more in line with that total year guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, which I just want to make sure you guys are properly modeling. And then the last question was repurchases. Obviously, we have wanted to take advantage of what we think is a very opportunistic price. We funded that with term loan liquidity, and we've been executing. We did want to give, which we did, cover in the current quarter because it was much heavier than even what we accomplished in the second quarter. And there is some remaining. We never commit to future activities. So we quoted up through yesterday or to the 5th, but that's, I think, proof of how confident we feel in our long-term strategy.Mauricio Serna VegaGreat.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question today comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair.Dylan Douglas CardenJared, just sticking with that last thought, the IRS refund, the primary use, is it in addition to that or how are you thinking about that one as well?Jared A. PoffYes, the lion's share of it is on our revolving credit facility, so adjust mechanically. As soon as that comes in, that will immediately be used to pay that down. We will always assess as we always do current stock price versus liquidity and overall capacity to buy. So we aren't committing to deploy that in one particular fashion. And on day one, it would be used to pay down our ABL debt. But that's -- there's no commitments or earmarked for those funds at this point.Dylan Douglas CardenGreat. And then I want to make sure I understand kind of the balance of guidance. So you have a lot of tailwinds between comparisons and Nike, et cetera. But the consumer sort of takes a leg down here. Would that be sort of detrimental to guidance at this point, just given some of the rhetoric on?Jared A. PoffYes. Yes. Certainly, Dylan, and you hit it on the head. As we look out for the year and how we built that guidance range, we are anticipating a pretty material shift in overall year-over-year performance than what we've experienced in the spring. That's always been the case, and that's what we've always communicated. And we do have some tailwinds, and you hit them on the head. We've got easier comps. We've got Nike coming in. We've got some new branding advertising going on that I just talked about. So there certainly are tailwinds. At the end of the day, though, and we've been saying it across the entire retail land, especially people who sell to the consumer, the discretionary consumer, we're seeing a lot of caution. And right now, I call it -- I feel like we're in a net risk position even as it pertains to our current guidance. But it really lies squarely with that discretionary consumer and how they're feeling it going into fall.Dylan Douglas CardenAnd the last one, we haven't talked about sort of the loyalty program in a while. I'm just kind of curious how these new brands interact with or essentially built on the back of the royalty number that you have and how much of your sales sort of happens (inaudible). Is there anything you can talk about there maybe, Doug?Douglas M. HoweYes, Dylan. This is Doug. Again, we're pleased with the progress of the brands that we mentioned in prepared remarks with regard to Keds and Topo Athletic and then most recently, La TIGRE. But it's very early days on, obviously. We're excited about that as we were the first launch partner at DSW, but we believe that there's opportunity to expand that outside of DBI channels of distribution, which is a broader opportunity as we move forward in general. So everything is performing to our expectations. We feel really good about that. And I think that just goes back to the strength of our business and the fact that we have the Brands segment as well as the Retail segment that we didn't realize those sales in our own channel. So just more confidence in the strategy that we're going to be deploying going forward.Jared A. PoffThe one thing I would add to that, Dylan, is -- and I mentioned it with our SG&amp;A. This month, we will be basically pulling off that transition services agreement actually a little ahead of schedule with Keds. So while this has been a pretty transition latent year for Keds, they've been performing at their acquisition model. We're really excited to have them now on our infrastructures for wholesale, for DTC and really excited about positioning them to start having strategic growth now that they're actually on our systems.Dylan Douglas CardenGot it. And then just another one just quickly here. Nike, can you kind of talk about maybe what the business was historically but I think I'm right in this is sort of a new relationship with Nike reengaging in this channel. How should -- how are you thinking about the scale, the pace of the dynamics of that relationship kind of coming -- I think it launches this fourth quarter, right?Douglas M. HoweYes, Dylan. This is Doug. Again, we continue to be very optimistic about that elevated partnership with Nike.

(DBI) is looking to its men’s business for future growth opportunities.On the Columbus, Ohio-based footwear company’s second quarter earnings call on Thursday, DBI CEO Doug Howe told analysts that growing its men’s business across the company remains one of its “largest white space opportunities” and represents a “significant growth lever” over the long term.More from Footwear NewsDesigner Brands Reaffirms Outlook After Sales and Earnings Beat in Q2Industry Moves: REI Taps VP of Merchandise Planning and Inventory Management“We believe that our new offerings from Vince Camuto and Le Tigre will help us gain traction with male customers that are increasingly prioritizing the unification of comfort and style,” Howe said in today’s call. “Our continued success was evident in our Q2 results, where we saw Vince Camuto men’s sales up 95 percent in dot-com.”Howe cited the successful launch of Vince Camuto’s new men’s Fly360 hybrid shoe in July as one of the reasons for the brand’s jump in sales online. “As we build out this franchise, what sets this line apart from the rest of the path is the use of special technologies and production, not often found in non-athletic men’s shoes,” the CEO said.DBI’s expanded deal with Hush Puppies is also expected to help with the company’s men’s business. Howe said on today’s call that Hush Puppies’ growth within DSW has been “robust,” up nearly 60 percent in the quarter versus last year, driven by men’s, with gains across casual, dress and boots.The company, which recently acquired the license for the Hush Puppies brand in the U.S. and Canada as part of its acquisition of Keds from Wolverine Worldwide, said its first product offering under this new license will drop in spring 2024.Howe added that DBI also executed an “advantageous buy” as part of its long-term relationship with Wolverine that provided the company an opportunity to offer “compelling savings” to its customers on Sperry, Saucony, Merrell and Chaco products in the quarter.Story continuesAs for the company’s renewed Nike relationship, Howe said he’s “very optimistic” about the rollout that will bring a variety of men’s, women’s and kids’ athletic footwear products to DSW.“We actually are going to be delivering the product a little bit earlier than we originally anticipated, about a month earlier,” Howe said. “We have some products that they run on our site, and we’ll have a significant amount of units rolling out to our stores in the next couple of weeks. So we feel good about that.”Net sales for the DSW-parent company decreased 7.8 percent to $792.2 million in the second quarter, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $785.7 million, according to Yahoo Finance. Comparable sales decreased by 8.9 percent and adjusted net income was $39.4 million, with an adjusted diluted EPS of 59 cents, which also beat analysts’ expectations of 44 cents.DBI maintained its full-year 2023 outlook and expects net sales growth, excluding contributions from Keds, to be down in the mid- to high-single digits for the year. Diluted EPS is expected in the range of $1.20 to $1.50.Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

It has since been detected in other symptomatic patients, in routine airport screening, and in wastewater samples in countries like Switzerland and South Africa in addition to Israel, Denmark, and the U.S.Based on the new data, it is early to draw any conclusions about the behaviour of BA.2.86 in the wider UK population, but the variant may be sufficiently transmissible in close contact setting, said the agency.""It is clear that there is some degree of widespread community transmission, both in the UK and globally, and we are working to ascertain the full extent of this"", said Renu Bindra, incident director, UKHSA.(Reporting by Khushi Mandowara in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)]"

The vaccine is yet to be authorized/approved by the FDA.Pirola was recently designated as a variant under the World Health Organization (“WHO”) monitoring. Though not prevalent in the United States, the CDC has indicated that the variant may be more capable of causing infection in people who previously had COVID-19 or were vaccinated with previous vaccines.A highly mutated strain of the virus, the CDC believes that the Pirola variant carries more than 35 mutations compared to the XBB.1.5 variant, the previously dominant variant.Last month, Moderna reported preliminary data from a clinical study that showed that mRNA-1273.815 generated a robust immune response against the EG.5 (also known as ‘Eris’) and FL.1.5.1 variants (also known as ‘Fornax’), which are currently the dominating variants in the United States. Per the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the two variants combined are responsible for around 36% of COVID-19 infections in the country.A regulatory filing is currently under the agency’s review seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.815. A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. A similar regulatory submission is currently under review in Europe. Management has also shared the above data with health regulators worldwide.Shares of Moderna have lost 39.7% year to date compared with the industry’s 13.2% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement claims it has built an ample supply for mRNA-1273.815 and is ready to ship the same doses for the upcoming fall vaccination season, provided the FDA authorizes the vaccine.With rising COVID-19 hospitalizations, the CDC recommends U.S. citizens inoculate themselves with the updated vaccines, likely to be available in the coming weeks. Health officials believe vaccinations can effectively help reduce severe disease and hospitalizations caused by the currently circulating COVID-19 variants.Story continuesApart from Moderna, other COVID vaccine makers like Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Novavax NVAX have also updated their vaccines to target the newer COVID-19 virus variants and, like Moderna, also expect to launch their respective vaccines during the fall season.Last month, Pfizer/BioNTech’s updated vaccine was authorized in the European Union. This authorization was based on preclinical data which showed that the vaccine was effective against the Eris variant and multiple other XBB variants, including XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and XBB.2.3.  A regulatory filing for this updated Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently under FDA’s review. Pfizer and BioNTech expect to prepare their updated COVID-19 vaccine for supply immediately after regulatory approval.Last month, Novavax reported preclinical data showing that its updated protein-based COVID-19 vaccine was effective against the Eris and XBB.1.16.6 variants. Alongside its second-quarter 2023 results, Novavax announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for this updated COVID-19 vaccine and intends to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. The company has stated that it is manufacturing the updated vaccine commercially and is planning to launch it in the fall.

Janssen said the incident applies to patients who were enrolled in its services prior to July 2 and does not apply to its pulmonary hypertension patients.Personal information that may have been exposed includes individuals’ names and one or more of the following: contact information, date of birth, health insurance information, and information about medications and associated conditions that were provided to the Janssen CarePath application, the companies said. Social Security numbers and financial account information were not contained in the database or affected, they said.The incident comes amid a slew of recent cyber attacks targeting the healthcare industry, including a file sharing service data breach announced in July that exposed personal information of Medicare recipients and millions of other healthcare consumers.IBM is offering free one-year credit monitoring to those who may be affected by the incident. These individuals will be sent notification letters and instructions on how to sign up for credit monitoring, it added.The tech giant has also established a toll-free call center for questions about the incident. The number for individual users is (888) 604-6584, and for healthcare providers is (877) 792-3593.Few details given about the breachNeither company provided specifics on the breach but said that Janssen notified IBM when it became aware of a technical method that could lead to unauthorized access to the database, and that IBM worked with the database provider to remediate the issue.Story continuesIBM said it was able to pinpoint the date of the unauthorized access but not the extent of the access. The company said it is notifying all customers and users whose information was contained in CarePath’s database “out of an abundance of caution.” It added that there is no indication that any of the information involved in the breach has been misusedThe number of potentially affected patients was not provided.On its website, Janssen says it helped more than 1.16 million U.S. patients last year through the CarePath program. According to the website, “once a healthcare professional has decided a Janssen medication is right for their patient, Janssen CarePath can help that patient find the tools they may need to get started on a medication and stay on track, including sharing options to help manage out-of-pocket costs.”Steps you can takeJanssen and IBM encouraged CarePath “to remain vigilant by regularly reviewing their account statements and explanations of benefits from their health insurer or care providers with respect to any unauthorized activity, and to promptly report any suspicious activity.”While no security system is foolproof, you can take steps to better protect your personal information online. After the Medicare breach was announced, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services advised people to take action. This included enrolling in a credit monitoring service, and obtaining a free credit report by calling 1-877-322-8228 or requesting it online at www.annualcreditreport.com.RELATED CONTENT7 Things to Do Right Away If You're a Victim of a Data BreachData Breach Exposes Personal Information of 612K Medicare RecipientsTempur Sealy Resumes Operations After Cyber AttackTrusting Fintech: Four Critical Moves to Protect Yourself]"

Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre joins the Live show to take a closer look at the movement in Apple stock and historical returns of the tech giant.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Apple shares under pressure today, poised to shed $200 billion in market value in just two days. Jared Blikre is here with a closer look at the moves in Apple. Jared, losses of just about 3%.JARED BLIKRE: Yes, that's only today. You take a look at the last two days, and we're down about 6.5%. Haven't seen a slide like that since November of last year. But I want to talk about what we should expect going forward. First of all, let me just pull up a candlestick chart so we can review the price action. Really negative price action about a month ago. We drop below the 50-day moving average, not shown here. Came up, kissed it, actually went a little bit above it, and now we are just selling off strongly those two big down candles.Now, we are testing levels basically from last June. And we'll have to see what happens from here, but I did compile a seasonality chart what happens to Apple each month of the year. Well, we have over 40 years of data here, from 1981 to 2022. And I have the average and the median. What we really stands out is we have August. That's a big up month here. And then September, September is a big down month. What usually happens in September?Well, next Tuesday, we have that big iPhone launch. And this is something that's been happening for about a decade now. Even before the iPhone was launched in 2007, though, September was a bad month. So interesting to see how that's developed. But usually we do see a kind of glide path higher in August and then a sell off from the announcement. But I think it's notable that we've already sold off in August.What it portends for the future? Not sure here, but I don't think we should necessarily expect that big rebound in October. Is there something structurally wrong with Apple here? Well, I would note, and it's not a disaster yet, but 3/4 of declining year-over-year revenue. This is something that you don't want to see with a big technology company because I've seen Sanford Bernstein recently only in the last few days compare Apple to Big Blue.This is a Big Blue chart going back all the way to the 1970s. And from 1997 to 2012, Big Blue had a huge run up here that also included a lot of volatility in the tech bubble. But after that, they faced declining revenues. And I think they went something like 20 quarters of declining revenues back-to-back, something that had never happened before.So kind of a cautionary tale here, we do want to see consumers increase their investments and increase their purchases in Apple products, such that they maintain or at least exceed that revenue growth that they've had in prior years. But that remains to be seen. So going to be interesting to see what happens come next Tuesday. Is it going to be a further sell, the news event, or might we see the opposite? Might investors just buy it? We'll have to see.]"

209,19ad7343-896e-3582-bcff-d4d3183d659d,IBM,2023-09-08,IBM rolls out new generative AI features and models,TechCrunch,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19ad7343-896e-3582-bcff-d4d3183d659d/ibm-rolls-out-new-generative.html,1694088042,STORY,['IBM'],"[Fighting for relevance in the growing -- and ultra-competitive -- AI space, IBM this week introduced new generative AI models and capabilities across its recently launched Watsonx data science platform.The new models, called the Granite series models, appear to be standard large language models (LLMs) along the lines of OpenAI's GPT-4 and ChatGPT, capable of summarizing, analyzing and generating text. IBM provided very little in the way of details about Granite, making it impossible to compare the models to rival LLMs -- including IBM's own. But the company claims that it'll reveal the data used to train the Granite series models, as well as the steps used to filter and process that data, ahead of the models' availability in Q3 2023.We'll hold the company to that.In the meantime, Tarun Chopra, IBM's VP of product management for data and AI, filled in some of the blanks via an email interview.""These new IBM Granite series models have been developed using ... curated, enterprise-quality data rather than publicly scraped data,"" Chopra said. ""The series has subsets that are specialized within different domains. For example, we have a model that's trained on finance data, and this allows AI builders to use a much smaller model that can be as performative as a larger general model. They can also support most enterprise NLP tasks, such as summarization, content generation and insight extraction.""Elsewhere, in Watsonx.ai -- the component of Watsonx that lets customers test, deploy and monitor models post-deployment -- IBM is rolling out Tuning Studio, a tool that allows users to tailor generative AI models to their data.Using Tuning Studio, IBM Watsonx customers can fine-tune models to new tasks with as few as 100 to 1,000 examples. Once users specify a task and provide labeled examples in the required data format, they can deploy the model via an API from the IBM Cloud.Also set to debut soon in Watsonx.ai is a synthetic data generator for tabular data -- the collections of rows and columns found in relational databases. IBM claims in a press release that, by generating synthetic data from custom data schemas and internal datasets, companies can can use the generator to extract insights for AI model training and fine tuning with ""reduced risk.""Story continuesIt's not clear what's meant by ""reduced risk,"" exactly, given the pitfalls of training AI with synthetic data. (We've asked for clarification.) But make of that what you will.IBM is also launching new generative AI capabilities in Watsonx.data, the company's data store that allows users to access data while applying query engines, governance, automation and integrations with existing databases and tools. Starting in Q4 2023 as part of a tech preview, customers will be able to ""discover, augment, visualize and refine"" data for AI through a self-service, chatbot-like tool.IBM, once again, was light on the specifics. But I'm picturing an experience akin to ChatGPT, albeit data visualization- and transformation-focused.Here's what Chopra had to say:""The generative AI capabilities becoming available in Watsonx.data later this month will allow users to simplify and accelerate the way they interact with their data ... To help illustrate how this experience might play out, say a user is looking for specific data. By using the AI chat assistant interface in Watsonx.data, the Watsonx.ai conversational model can generate a text response alongside API calls and parameters to support that user’s request. It’s also possible to import external data using the same interface, and the AI model will perform semantic data enrichment.""Around the same time -- Q4 2023 -- Watsonx.data will gain a vector database capability to support retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), IBM says. RAG is an AI framework for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external knowledge sources -- useful, obviously, for IBM's enterprise clientele.In other big news, IBM is embarking on the technical preview for Watsonx.governance, a toolkit that -- in the company's rather vague words -- provides mechanisms to protect customer privacy, detect model bias and drift and help organizations meet ethics standards. And starting next week, IBM will launch Intelligent Remediation, which the company says will leverage generative AI models to assist IT teams with summarizing incidents and suggesting workflows to help implement solutions.""As demonstrated by the ongoing evolution of the watsonx platform within just a few months since launch, we're here to support clients through the entire AI lifecycle"" IBM SVP of products Dinesh Nirmal said in a press release. ""As a transformation partner, IBM is collaborating with clients to help them scale AI in a secure, trustworthy way -- from helping to institute foundational elements of their data strategies to tuning models for their specific business use cases to helping them govern models beyond that.”Certainly, IBM is under pressure to prove that it can make a dent in the crowded AI field.In the company's second fiscal quarter, IBM reported revenue that missed analyst expectations as the company suffered from a bigger-than-expected slowdown in its infrastructure business segment.

""People will be very focused on the football games, but I think the beer battles might be more interesting.""The NFL season will be crucial for AB InBev after months of declining sales.

However, UAW President Shawn Fain has dismissed the offer, calling it ""insulting"" in statement. RBC Capital Markets Lead Equity Analyst for Global Autos Tom Narayan says a strike is ""largely accepted and understood is going to happen."" Narayan says that a work stoppage would likely be similar to the one in 2019, noting that 2024 is an election year, so it's unlikely the Biden administration would like a strike to go on for too long. Narayan has done some calculations and sys that ""elevated labor costs that may come out of this may not actually be as painful for the automakers as some may fear."" The bigger issue for the Big Three, Narayan says is the concern about consumer spending. Narayan says right now, there is support for higher prices, but higher interest rates could crimp demand. ""To me, Narayan says, ""the pricing coming down is a much bigger threat to the automakers than the impact of a UAW strike.""Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Let's move on to the UAW strike now, with General Motors making an offer to the UAW, just a week before their current contract is set to expire. Pras Subramanian is here with the details. Pras, what are the numbers? What have they offered?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Akiko, GM, the latest to submit a proposal to the UAW, following Ford's move last week. So big picture stuff here. So for all employees, more paid holidays and a $5,500 ratification bonus. Now for temp and in progress or tiered workers, they're going to get a big 56% wage increase over time. For entry-level workers and a 20% for temp workers.Now, for most workers, big picture here, a 10% increase in wages, true 3% lump sum payments, a one-time $6,000 inflation payment, and then a $5,000 inflation protection bonus over the life of the UAW contract. So to start, but not really what the union has initially demanded.Story continuesWant to highlight Ford real quick right here. So today, they announced a wage hikes of about-- for about 8,000 UAW employees of around $9,000. This is around 14% of the workforce. This is a bump up for some of the workers to get to the top of the wage scale here. And this is part of the 2019 UAW agreement, not the new one. It's part of the old one. That's still kind of ongoing right now.SEANA SMITH: So, Pras, the fact that this is not exactly what the union wants, it still seems that the two sides are very far apart on this.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, Seana, for sure. I mean, the UAW wants something around a 40% pay hike. They want to end tiered compensation. They want cost of living increases. And they also want a defined pension plan among other bonuses now. So union leadership is talking a tough game, ready to strike if needed. Here's UAW President Sean Fein talking to the AP yesterday about this.At the end of the day, if we don't have agreements with the three of them by September 14, then there will be action. We're willing to listen when they want to get real and talk about workers issues and the economic realism that our workers have been living with for the last 16 years. And so when they're ready to get serious, we're ready.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So to be clear, the union doesn't have to strike without an agreement. They can also strike at certain automakers while negotiating with the other two. So it all depends on the situation here.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Pras, we have seen this with in other industries you know. You've got the threat of a strike, and the strike doesn't actually take hold. But the agreement leads to higher costs, higher input for these companies. What does it ultimately mean for the consumer? I mean, there's been a number of estimates out there that suggest that this is going to be the higher costs that may come with a negotiation. An agreement would be passed down to consumers.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, right about now, I think it's around 5% to 6% of the car cost is due to labor, so you might see a bump up there with the passed on costs of higher labor costs. But even in the case that if there is a strike, for instance, if there is a strike, I don't think consumers are sort of OK here from a price point of view.Most automakers have 90 days of supply, so you're not going to see that much of a change in price unless this drags on. In which case, you might see inventory come down. Premiums being paid for new cars. And then maybe shoppers may cross shop and go to other automakers that don't use union workers.But we saw a report out today, Akiko, about how if inventory goes down for new cars, you might see used cars go up. And that actually would increase insurance prices because insurance costs are more for used cars. So you might see some pain at the insurance payment area, but not so much yet, just yet, but we'll see what this deal kind of shapes up to be before we can see what consumers will pay for.AKIKO FUJITA: OK. Just one week to go until that September 14 deadline. Pras, thanks so much for that.]"

Three nooses were placed around Black employees' workstations, she said.Banks said that after she took leave because of work stress and filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in late 2013, GM retaliated by suspending her disability benefits and demoting her upon her return. She sued in November 2014.In a 74-page decision, Circuit Judge Denny Chin said the evidence suggested ""pervasive and long-term sex and race-based animosity"" that a reasonable jury could find created a hostile work environment.Chin said use of the epithet, ""probably the most offensive word in English,"" and even one placement of a noose, ""imbued as it is with historical gravity as a symbol and tool of actual violence,"" supported Banks' hostile environment claim.The appeals court also found sufficient evidence that bias and an intent to retaliate were factors in Banks' demotion.It returned the case to U.S. District Judge William Skretny in Buffalo, New York.GM declined to comment.The Detroit-based automaker had said many incidents that Banks complained about were too old, and the ""totality of the circumstances"" did not show a hostile work environment.Story continuesBanks' lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Banks took disability leave again in January 2016 and as of last month remained on leave.The EEOC supported Banks' appeal. In March, the agency sued Exxon Mobil after nooses were reported at the oil company's complex in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.The case is Banks v General Motors LLC et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-2640.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)]"

The UAW has said 97% of members voted in favor of authorizing a strike if agreement is not reached. A union official said Ford was expected to make a new counteroffer on Thursday.Fain, who represents 146,000 workers at the Detroit Three, said GM's offer was ""an insulting proposal that doesn’t come close to an equitable agreement for America’s autoworkers.... The clock is ticking. Stop wasting our members’ time. Tick tock.""The UAW said the GM offer would change the formula for calculating profit sharing and if it had been in effect last year, workers would have received 29% less. The UAW also said Ford's proposal would have cut profit sharing by 21%.GM shares closed down 0.8% to $32.57.GM said the wage hike is the largest proposed since 1999. It is also offering a $6,000 one-time inflation-related payment and $5,000 in inflation-protection bonuses over the life of the agreement, along with a $5,500 ratification bonus.Chrysler-parent Stellantis said Wednesday it planned to make a counteroffer to the UAW this week.GM said that under its offer, current temporary employees will receive a 20% increase to $20 per hour wage and it would shorten the time it takes to get to the maximum wage rate for permanent employees - mirroring proposals from Ford.Story continuesGM President Mark Reuss said in a video posted on Thursday ""we need a fair contract that both rewards our employees and protects the long-term health of our business.""The union's demands include a 20% immediate wage increase followed by four 5% annual wage hikes, defined-benefit pensions for all workers, 32-hour work weeks and additional cost of living hikes. GM is proposing to give employees an additional paid holiday.The UAW also wants all temporary workers at U.S. automakers to be made permanent, seeks enhanced profit sharing and the restoration of retiree health-care benefits and cost-of-living adjustments.A UAW strike that shuts the Detroit Three manufacturers could cost carmakers, suppliers and workers over $5 billion, Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group estimated.With new car inventories tight, consumer experts have said that could translate into higher car prices - an important component of inflation.Last week, the UAW filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against GM and Stellantis saying they refused to bargain in good faith.J.P.Morgan on Thursday said supply chain disruptions from a potential UAW strike would cut new vehicle production, drive up used car prices and put pressure on margins in the personal auto insurance business.Earlier on Thursday, Ford said about 8,000 U.S. workers represented by the UAW will get an average $4.33 an hour in additional pay under provisions of the current contract agreed in 2019. Stellantis said it also raised pay this week for 4,000 workers per the 2019 contract.(Reporting by David Shepardson; additional reporting by Joe White and Ben Klayman; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Tomasz Janowski and Josie Kao)]"

(ODFL) provided an update on the performance of its less-than-truckload (LTL) segment, which is its primary revenue generator, in August.Old Dominion's revenue per day fell 1.4% year over year in August 2023, owing to a 6% decrease in LTL tons per day, partially offset by an increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The downfall in LTL tons per day was due to a 1.2% decrease in LTL shipments per day and a 4.8% decrease in LTL weight per shipment.Quarter to date, Old Dominion’s LTL revenue per hundredweight and LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, jumped 1.8% and 8.8% year over year, respectively.Marty Freeman, president and chief executive officer of Old Dominion, stated, ""The decrease in Old Dominion’s tonnage for August reflects continued softness in the domestic economy as well as a change in the mix of our freight. Through July of this year, our daily shipment count averaged approximately 47,000 shipments per day and that average increased to approximately 50,000 shipments per day in August. This incremental increase is due in part to the direct and indirect impact of one of our largest competitors ceasing operations in July, as we believe underlying demand has remained relatively consistent. Our team responded well to this inflection in our volumes and our service metrics have remained best-in-class. We will continue to focus on providing our customers with superior service at a fair price, as we believe this element of our long-term strategic plan continues to support our ability to win market share.""Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Old Dominion carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Transportation sector are United Airlines (UAL) and SkyWest, Inc.

222,aa184f5f-a943-317f-ae87-834d86da6d43,UAL,2023-09-08,Most Airline Stocks Hurt During Wednesday's Trading: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-airline-stocks-hurt-during-130800070.html,1694092080,STORY,"['LUV', 'UAL', 'ALK']","[It is no secret that air travel has bounced back very strongly from pandemic lows. Air travel continues to be particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more encouraging is that international demand is also bouncing back nicely. Strong passenger volumes bode well for airline stocks.Despite the optimism, airline stocks failed to perform well during Wednesday’s trading. Shares of airline heavyweights like Southwest Airlines LUV and United Airlines UAL declined 2.6% and 0.3%, respectively, yesterday from Tuesday’s closing price. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index slid 1.4% at the close of trading on Sep 6.What Led to the Price Decline?It is well known that fuel expenses represent a significant input cost for the aviation space. Consequently, the recent uptick in oil prices does not bode well for airlines. United Airlines’ management stated in an SEC filing that “since mid-July 2023, jet fuel prices have climbed over 20%”.Oil prices have spiked following Saudi Arabia and Russia’s decisions to extend their voluntary production cuts to the end of the year. Moreover, the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes by the Fed has also supported the northward movement of oil prices. This is because higher interest rates generally tend to elevate costs and slow down the economy, which translates to less demand for oil.Following the increase in the oil price, UAL, Alaska Air Group ALK and LUV increased their fuel cost per gallon projections for the third quarter of 2023. United Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95-$3.05 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.5-$2.8 range).Southwest Airlines now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $2.7-$2.8 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.55-$2.65 range). Operating revenue per available seat mile for the third quarter of 2023 is now expected to decline in the 5-7% band from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 3-7% decline).Story continuesAlaska Air now expects the fuel cost per gallon in the $3.15-$3.25 band (the earlier guidance was in the $2.7-$2.8 range). Due to high fuel costs, the third-quarter adjusted pre-tax margin is now expected in the 10-12% range (earlier guidance was 14-16%). Total revenues are now expected to increase in the 1-2% range from third-quarter 2022 actuals (the earlier projection was for a 0-3% increase).High Labor Costs – Another HeadwindAs if the recent spike in fuel costs was not bad enough for airlines, the northward movement of labor costs adds to its woes. With U.S. airlines grappling with labor shortage in the post-Covid-19 high-demand scenario, the bargaining power of various labor groups has naturally increased. As a result, we have seen pay-hike deals being inked in the space. This is resulting in a spike in labor costs.American Airlines AAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), recently lifted its forecast for third-quarter non-fuel unit costs due to the four-year pay-related deal with pilots. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Primarily due to high labor and fuel costs, the Zacks Airline industry has declined 9.1% in a month compared to the S&amp;P 500’s 0.1% increase.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this retailer have returned -5.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry, which Target falls in, has lost 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Target is expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -24.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.3%. This estimate has changed -5.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.07 indicates a change of +19.4% from what Target is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -8.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Target.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Target, the consensus sales estimate of $25.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.5%. The $107.23 billion and $107.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.7% and +0.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTarget reported revenues of $24.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.9%. EPS of $1.80 for the same period compares with $0.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.91%. The EPS surprise was +27.66%.Over the last four quarters, Target surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Target is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Target. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Target's (NYSE:TGT) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Target is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$4.8b ÷ (US$53b - US$19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Target has an ROCE of 14%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 10% generated by the Consumer Retailing industry. Check out our latest analysis for Target roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Target compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Target here  for free.So How Is Target's ROCE Trending?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 14% and the business has deployed 30% more capital into its operations. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.The Bottom Line On Target's ROCETo sum it up, Target has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Target, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

REITs offer several benefits to investors, including high dividend payouts. REITs are required to distribute 90% or more of their profits to shareholders as dividends. The large dividend payments make REITs attractive to income investors who are hunting for yield.Additionally, REITs allow investors to speculate on and dabble in sections of the real estate market without having to buy individual properties themselves. Owing to their high dividends and focus on the real estate market, REITs are often a stable choice during times of market volatility. Think a market crash is coming? Here are three real estate stocks to buy for a soft landing.Simon Property Group (SPG)a person standing in a shopping mall with a bag in their hand. May CPI data.Source: ShutterstockSimon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) is a real estate investment trust. The firm has 232 property holdings and is the largest owner of shopping malls in the U.S. The company went through an extremely difficult time during the pandemic when most of its shopping malls were shut down. Those shutdowns later forced Simon Property Group to operate at reduced capacity. Consequently, SPG stock is down 36% over the last five years. However, more recently, the share price has been recovering, rising 14% in the last year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTrading at 20 times forward earnings, SPG stock looks reasonably valued right now. And it pays shareholders a strong quarterly dividend of $1.90 per share, which yields over 6.50%. Few other stocks have as generous a quarterly payout.With the Covid-19 crisis behind it and consumers back to shopping in person, Simon Property Group looks poised for further gains. The median price target on SPG stock is currently $125.50, implying a 10% upside from current levels.American Tower (AMT)a ground-up view of multiple cell towers in a circleSource: ShutterstockAmerican Tower (NYSE:AMT) owns and operates towers that are essential for fifth-generation (5G) signal broadcasts. Currently, the company owns more than 200,000 communications sites globally, including more than 40,000 towers and broadcast sites in the U.S. and Canada. The company makes money by leasing space on its towers to telecommunication companies that use the towers for signal antennas and 5G equipment.Story continuesAMT stock has struggled recently, having declined by almost 30% over the last 12 months. The pullback has been due to higher interest rate expenses on its $39 billion of debt (the company funds its land purchases and tower construction with debt). However, there are still reasons to like AMT stock. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $1.57 per quarter for a yield of roughly 3.50%. Over the last 10 years, American Tower has increased its quarterly payout by 486%.Boston Properties (BXP)Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of boston properties, stock market chart background. BXP stock.Source: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockBoston Properties (NYSE:BXP) is a real estate investment trust that invests in top-tier office space across the U.S., from New York City to Los Angeles. The company currently owns nearly 200 commercial real estate properties that combined have 54.1 million square feet of office space.Boston Properties has had a tough go of it since the pandemic struck in 2020. With remote work continuing and many companies giving up their office leases, Boston Properties has struggled.BXP stock has been flat so far in 2023. However, over the past five years, the stock has fallen nearly 50%, pushing its price-earnings (P/E) ratio down to an attractive level of 15. Current trends look challenging. However, BXP stock offers a hefty quarterly dividend payment of 98 cents, which translates to a yield approaching 6%.Barclays (LON:BARC) bank recently raised its price target on the stock to $65 from $58, saying that it sees potential in Boston Properties for further growth and success in the real estate sector.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

The entity will have a combination of two highly complementary portfolios with unique product diversity and innovative sustainability capabilities. The combined market capitalization of WestRock and Smurfit Kappa is around $18.9 billion (as of Sep 6, 2023).Smurfit WestRock will have an unmatched geographic reach spanning 42 countries with a significant presence in both Europe and the Americas. Given this scale, the merged entity is expected to be the global “Go-To” packaging partner, per the management of both the companies.The combination will lead to improved operating efficiency and increased returns across more than 500 converting operations and 67 mills.The merged entity’s combined last twelve months’ revenues and adjusted EBITDA were around $34 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively (as of 30 Jun, 2023). The WestRock-Smurfit Kappa combination is expected to result in annual pre-tax run-rate cost synergies of more than $400 million in the first year following its completion.Any potential combination is subject to the approval of shareholders of both the companies, the receipt of required regulatory clearances as well as other customary conditions. There is no assurance, however, at this time whether the deal will be finalized not. Smurfit WestRock would be incorporated and domiciled in Ireland with global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and North and South American operations headquartered in Atlanta, GA. WestRock shareholders could receive shares of the combined entity.Both WestRock and Smurfit Kappa Group plc are major players in the Paper and Related Products industry. Recently, the industry has been impacted by weak packaging demand, as customer spending has been muted due to inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, increasing packaging requirements due to the rising trend in e-commerce activities and steady demand from consumer-oriented end markets, such as food and beverages and healthcare, are expected to support the industry.Story continuesThe growing preference for paper as a sustainable and eco-friendly packaging option due to environmental concerns will act as a key driver for the industry going forward. The companies are thus working on boosting their capacity to capitalize on this packaging demand.WestRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of WestRock have fallen 21.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s 7.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the basic materials space are Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS and Hawkins, Inc.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnveiling the RisksDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with WestRock Co should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.02. These indicators suggest that WestRock Co, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany SnapshotWestRock manufactures corrugated packaging and consumer packaging, such as folding cartons and paperboard. After the merger of RockTenn and MeadWestvaco in fall 2015, WestRock became the largest North American producer of solid bleached sulfate and the second-largest producer of containerboard, which is used in the production of shipping containers.Is WestRock Co (WRK) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapWestRock Co's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of WestRock Co's Altman Z-score reveals WestRock Co's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating WestRock Co's historical data, 2021: 0.05; 2022: 0.07; 2023: 0.01, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates WestRock Co's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of WestRock Co's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0; 2022: 0.06; 2023: -0.03) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that WestRock Co might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionDespite the seemingly attractive valuation of WestRock Co (NYSE:WRK), the low Altman Z-Score and declining financial health indicators suggest that it might be a potential value trap. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith and Julie Hyman break down the report and the potential benefits of the merger.Video Transcript- Shares of WestRock, WestRock, WestRock, yes, they are jumping today after the company said it's in talks with Smurfit Kappa group to merge in a deal worth about $20 billion. The combination would result in a packaging giant called Smurfit WestRock. When you put this in our group Slack this morning, I had to look up Smurfit. I didn't know if you were just like serving up a Merriam-Webster's word to us that I did not know.This is indeed a deal that looks like it may go through here.- Yeah. The companies themselves have, after some initial reporting, the companies themselves acknowledged that they were in talks here. So we're talking about packaging, basically, for all kinds of stuff, all different kinds of packaging. The issue is, in this environment, we've seen a drop in demand for packaging because we've seen somewhat of a drop in demand for goods. So that's why, potentially, you would have some benefit to teaming up.Although Jefferies this morning out with a note and saying there are maybe some limited synergies and advantages from this kind of a deal. Jefferies saying rival International Paper has shown maybe there aren't as many synergies as you would anticipate. So WestRock shares are trading higher. I believe Smurfit Kappa shares had been taking a hit. It is a UK based company, so the shares have been falling in European trading, but, you know, obviously $20 billion deal, if it goes through, would be a big one.So we'll have to keep an eye and see if it gets done.- Well, especially at a time where many people who are tracking their packages one way or another, or for the broader push towards more sustainable packaging if combining these two entities would make it so that we did have more of those targets actually being hit, and perhaps, there is some kind of consolidated effort that they can earmark or put towards that. That is perhaps where we would see this packaging giant make sense for just streamlining a lot of those operations]"

(RCL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd-rcl-130011730.html,1694091611,STORY,['RCL'],"[Royal Caribbean (RCL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this cruise operator have returned -4.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, which Royal Caribbean falls in, has lost 6.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $3.36 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1,192.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.02 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +180.3%. This estimate has changed -0.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.15 indicates a change of +35.3% from what Royal Caribbean is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Royal Caribbean.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Royal Caribbean, the consensus sales estimate of $3.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +33.3%. The $13.66 billion and $15.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +54.5% and +12.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryRoyal Caribbean reported revenues of $3.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.3%. EPS of $1.82 for the same period compares with -$2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.28%. The EPS surprise was +15.19%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Royal Caribbean is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Royal Caribbean. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

248,18c5e14e-4bbf-3edc-842d-1b3b2785394f,V,2023-09-08,Visa Research Highlights Emerging Fraud Schemes in Retail and eCommerce,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-research-highlights-emerging-fraud-161300652.html,1694103180,STORY,"['V', 'TGT']","[Latest edition of Visa Biannual Threats Report Show Increasingly Sophisticated Fraud Landscape for Consumers.SAN FRANCISCO, September 07, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), a world leader in digital payments, released the Fall 2023 edition of its Biannual Threats Report which highlights emerging fraud schemes targeting the global economy. This edition showcases a significant rise of phishing schemes proliferated through generative AI tools, and a marked increase in enumeration and ransomware. The report also shows how Visa is working with law enforcement around the globe to bring perpetrators of fraud to justice.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230907056353/en/While the global fraud rate trended lower than normal expected fraud levels during the report’s time period (January – June 2023), Visa shared that it helped to proactively block $30 billion in those time periods. However, threat actors were successful in conducting targeted and sophisticated fraud schemes impacting specific institutions, technology, and processes. Highlights of the report’s findings include:Ransomware attacks continue to evolve and grow in prevalence. March 2023 surpassed prior ransomware attack records for the most attacks in one month with nearly 460 attacks; a 91% increase over February 2023 numbers and 62% higher compared to the same period in 2022. A 2023 ransomware report identified that exploited vulnerabilities were the most common (36%) root cause of ransomware attacks, followed by compromised credentials (29%). Interestingly, ransomware attacks and related threat actors do not always target payment data specifically but will compromise any data accessible during their attacks including payment data or personal identifiable information.Enumeration attacks continue to impact merchants and consumers alike. The period covered in this study saw a 40% increase in enumeration attacks over the previous six months. Visa used its Visa Account Attack Intelligence to identify these attacks in real time to alert merchants and stop fraud in its tracks.Card-Not-Present merchants emerge as bigger target. Online merchants were responsible for 58% of total fraud and breach investigations, while brick and mortar merchants made up 20%, and ransomware/fraud scheme made up 7%.Story continuesRetail-specific schemes saw a measurable uptick during the past six months, including:False, spoofed, or counterfeit merchants: Consumers are being targeted through websites that seem like their favorite merchants. These sites are established to take customers' orders but do not fulfill the goods or services ordered and instead steal customers’ payment account information.The rise of malvertising: Some scammers are developing fake ads to try to garner personal information. Victims of these schemes are targeted with search engine-optimized scams that prey on what they might be interested in legitimately purchasing.Flash-fraud scams: Flash fraud merchants, also known as bust-out schemes, which is when threat actors establish a legitimate merchant and process a small number of legitimate payments to establish credibility, are also on the rise. Once a satisfactory payment processing history is established, the seller suddenly submits a large number of fraudulent transactions—often using stolen payment account data – and quickly disappears after they obtain the funds from the stolen accounts.Free gift scams: An emerging crypto scam in the retail space is the ""free gift"" scam, where bad actors offer a ""free gift"" through a pop-up window asking the victim to confirm the transaction. When clicked, the malicious payload is executed, which includes a file with malicious NFT, allowing fraudsters to communicate with the victim’s wallet and authorize cryptocurrency transfers from the victim’s wallet to the fraudster’s.""While we are pleased by the lower-than-expected fraud rate over the last few months, this edition of the Biannual Threats Report continues to underscore just how savvy fraudsters continue to be,"" said Paul Fabara, Chief Risk Officer at Visa. ""The same way criminals take advantage of technology advances, so does Visa, and the $30 billion of fraud prevented in the last six months alone is a great testament to that.""While the threat landscape is more complicated than ever, consumers can take solace in the ways Visa is working to protect them. Visa Payment Fraud Disruption's efforts over the past six months have resulted in significant crackdowns on cybercrime activities with help from global law enforcement and government agencies.Visa also helped bring fraudsters to justice around the world.

249,4720468a-d4fb-39b0-a1f6-20afee56489e,APH,2023-09-08,Amphenol Corporation's (NYSE:APH) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amphenol-corporations-nyse-aph-stock-130102248.html,1694091662,STORY,['APH'],"[Amphenol (NYSE:APH) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 12% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amphenol's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Amphenol How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amphenol is:25% = US$1.9b ÷ US$7.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Amphenol's Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Amphenol has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, Amphenol was able to see a decent net income growth of 16% over the last five years.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Amphenol's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 16% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Amphenol's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Amphenol Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 25% (implying that the company retains 75% of its profits), it seems that Amphenol is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, Amphenol is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 29%. As a result, Amphenol's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 23% for future ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Amphenol's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

This launch should further strengthen Lockheed Martin’s position in the space satellite market.Lockheed’s Place in Satellite MarketSDA’s Transport Layer aims to provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide to the full range of warfighter platforms. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the satellites that Lockheed launched recently come with LMT’s SmartSat software, which makes it easier to dynamically add and quickly change missions in orbit through simple app uploads.The satellites also host Link-16 radios, which enable sensor-to-shooter targeting by connecting systems that include fighter aircraft and Integrated Air and Missile Defense networks. This, in turn, will modernize the United States’ current capabilities to better support warfighter needs to act timely against threat warnings and provide situational awareness information across the range of military operations.Such benefits offered by Lockheed’s satellites must have enabled the company to win the contract of building 36 Tranche 2 Transport Layer Beta satellites in August 2023 from the SDA. LMT is also producing 42 satellites for SDA's Tranche 1 Transport Layer, to be launched in 2024. Further, the company recently opened a satellite processing center to efficiently assemble, integrate and test these satellites.These developments reflect the solid demand that Lockheed enjoys in the space surveillance market, with space-based assets being increasingly used in defending a nation against hostile attacks.Growth ProspectsPer a report by the Research And Markets firm, the global military satellites market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.2% during the 2023-2027 period. This should benefit Lockheed Martin, which provides national security space capabilities.A few other defense players that can gain from the expanding military satellite market are Airbus SE EADSY, L3Harris Technologies Inc. LHX and Northrop Grumman Inc. NOC.   Airbus’ Defense and Space unit has delivered more than 70 Earth observation satellite systems, accumulating close to 600 years of in-orbit experience. The PeruSAT-1, a very high-resolution Earth observation satellite system, was built for the government and Space Agency of Peru, which provides high-quality imagery for both civil and military applications.EADSY boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Airbus’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 17.8% from that reported in 2022.L3Harris is the prime contractor of Navigation Technology Satellite – 3 (NTS-3). The NTS-3, to be launched later this year, will provide for the safety and success of the warfighters with its accurate and uninterrupted positioning, navigation and timing technology. The company is expanding its satellite production site to include advanced production of unclassified satellites, which will deliver experimental capabilities for national defense.LHX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for L3Harris’ 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 8.9% from that reported in 2022.Northrop Grumman's deep mission expertise gives it an edge in knowing what it takes to protect the warfighter, both in space and from space.  In August 2023, NOC was selected by SDA to design and build 36 data transport satellites, the first space vehicles in the latest generation of its low-Earth orbit Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop Grumman’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 5.6% from that reported in 2022.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past year, shares of LMT have gained 1.5% against the industry’s 6.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These efficiencies will lead to improved sensors for the jet, as well as the capability to transport an increased number of long-range precision munitions, enhanced data integration, heightened compatibility with other systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare capabilities.Considering the aforementioned discussion, once the TR-3-upgraded F-35 jets are delivered, LMT will gain financially in terms of solid revenues. However, the company currently expects a delay in the process of this technology upgrade, which has resultantly shifted the first jet delivery with the TR-3 upgrade from 2023 to a period between April and June 2024. This has led Lockheed to trim its F-35 delivery numbers for 2023. Growth ProspectsLMT’s management believes that this reduced delivery outlook for F-35 jets will not have any material impact on its 2023 financial guidance. Moreover, the company continues to manufacture F-35 aircraft at a rate of 156 per year and expects to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR-3 software development and testing.Story continuesThis, along with the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 F-35 aircraft, reflects the solid demand Lockheed Martin continues to enjoy for this stealth jet. This can be expected to boost its revenue growth prospects in the coming years.Amid ongoing geopolitical tensions worldwide, the successful integration and timely delivery of TR-3 upgraded F-35 jets can be projected to boost the demand for this lethal combat aircraft even more in the days ahead, thereby bolstering LMT’s top line.Peers to BenefitOther defense companies that play a significant role in manufacturing the F-35 jet and thus are likely to enjoy the perks of the increased demand for F-35 aircraft are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop Grumman supplies many key technologies for the F-35 jet like the AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array fire control radar, center fuselage, AN/AAQ-37 Distributed Aperture System as well as mission systems and mission-planning software. It also provides sustainment and modernization support to F-35 users.The long-term earnings growth rate of NOC stands at 4.1%. The consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s 2023 sales indicates a growth rate of 5.6% from the prior-year reported figure.RTX Corporation RTX: Its business unit, Pratt &amp; Whitney, has been manufacturing and sustaining the F135 engine for the F-35 Joint Program to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft. Moreover, RTX’s combat-proven Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile air-to-air missile has been integrated into F-35 jets, making it a more lethal combat aircraft.RTX Corporation has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RTX’s 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 9.9% from the prior-year reported figure.BAE Systems plc BAESY: The company provides the Vehicle Management Computer, the electronic warfare system, the active inceptor control system and the aft fuselage for every F-35 at manufacturing facilities. BAESY also delivers sustainability, technical support and training services to keep F-35s mission-ready.It has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAE Systems’ 2023 sales implies a growth rate of 15.7% from the prior-year reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have increased 0.8% against the industry’s fall of 4.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

257,7dace895-84a4-35a8-a5bc-79f96fd665dc,MAR,2023-09-08,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Marriott International, Inc. (MAR) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-marriott-international-130011444.html,1694091611,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International (MAR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this hotel company have returned -1.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.1% change. The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, to which Marriott belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Marriott is expected to post earnings of $2.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.63 points to a change of +29% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.57 indicates a change of +10.9% from what Marriott is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Marriott is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Marriott, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.86 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.93 billion and $25.31 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +5.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarriott reported revenues of $6.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.8%. EPS of $2.26 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.46%. The EPS surprise was +3.2%.Over the last four quarters, Marriott surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marriott is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marriott. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Called Mobile Onsite Network-as-a-Service (NaaS), the solution delivers a private network, private mobile edge compute (MEC), SD-Wan, and satellite connectivity to customer locations. The 10-foot portable trailer was developed with dual-core network capabilities supporting both 4G and 5G standalone functionality. It also provides scalable, reliable 5G and edge compute that can be managed locally by enterprise and public sector customers for enhanced operational flexibility just about wherever they need it. The first deployment of Verizon's Mobile Onsite NaaS is at Lockheed Martin's Waterton, Colorado campus. In a matter of hours after arriving, the entire solution was set-up and had completed testing over a satellite communications connection, demonstrating its ease of use in almost any environment. The Mobile Onsite NaaS will be used to collect sensor data and video providing key performance indicators to assess network operations. Watch the video on Mobile Onsite NaaS here.""By delivering the mission critical connectivity that our network provides to customer locations, we are demonstrating how 5G and edge computing can help customers address their strategic priorities and continue to develop advanced solutions,” said Srini Kalapala, Senior Vice President for Technology and Product Development at Verizon. “A private network on location delivers the high-speed, high-capacity, and low-latency needed for various applications as well as greater privacy and security.”Story continues“As the first host of this advanced system, Lockheed Martin continues to demonstrate our commitment to harnessing the best of commercial technology to create 21st Century Security capabilities that keep our customers ahead of emerging threats,” said Dan Rice, vice president of 5G.MIL® Programs at Lockheed Martin. “We look forward to continuing to collaborate with Verizon on our 5G.MIL® Unified Network Solutions, which aim to provide cohesive communications, edge processing and advanced networking capabilities for interoperable, resilient and secure connectivity and data flow across all domains.”Even with 5G technology more accessible than ever, in some situations there is still an opportunity to enhance the network and technological capabilities for enterprise and public sector customers in locations where network connections and coverage can be challenging. The asset offers opportunities for industries such as utilities, agriculture, manufacturing, and more to take advantage of the private network and compute service at a particular location without the costs entailed in a permanent installation allowing for a plug and play model for temporary or permanent use. Consider entertainment companies who need guaranteed 5G and edge compute for a concert, infrastructure providers who need to use drones to assess bridge repairs, or public safety professionals who need to set up a mobile command center at the site of a natural disaster.Mobile Lab as a ServiceThe Mobile Onsite NaaS can also be used as a Mobile Lab as a Service, which is part of Verizon Innovation Labs’ offerings. Verizon has three Innovation Labs located in Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco that provide customers with integrated spaces with products and solutions for collaboration as well as an active lab environment for development and testing. These spaces include both commercial and private 5G networks, NSA and IMS cores, multiple RF shielded rooms and a full private MEC portfolio for developers. They support enterprise teams with real-world technical validation, designed to accelerate solution development and offer Verizon’s deep engineering expertise to help them get the most out of the Verizon network.

Cost-control measures support the company's bottom line despite inflationary pressure. While manufacturing activities have been showing signs of improvement, it has remained in the contraction territory for the past several months, indicating a lower demand environment. This weighs on the industry's near-term prospects.Despite the dim outlook, Stanley Black &amp; Decker and Lincoln Electric are poised for growth on the back of improving supply chains and an uptick in manufacturing activities.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry comprises companies that develop and distribute hand and mechanics tools, hydraulic tools, engineered fastening systems, and heavy-lifting technology solutions. Arc-welding products, robotic-welding packages, fume-extraction equipment, oxy-fuel cutting equipment, plasma cutters, healthcare solutions, electronic security solutions and other products are also produced by some tool-makers.The highly advanced tools are used in industrial, commercial, oil &amp; gas, mining, automotive and other industries. The providers of electronic security solutions cater to commercial, retailers, government, financial and healthcare markets. Talking about international operations, some industry players provide products and services to customers in North and South America, Japan, Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle East.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Tools IndustryPersistent Weakness in the Manufacturing Sector: Continued weakness in the manufacturing sector has been weighing on demand in the industry. Per the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, in August, the Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manager's Index) touched 47.6%, contracting for the 10th consecutive month. A figure less than 50% indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity. The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory at 46.8%, declining 0.5 percentage points from the figure recorded in July.Story continuesWhile the manufacturing sector remains in the contraction territory, it is showing signs of gradual improvement. The Manufacturing PMI has been steadily improving over the past few months. In August, the index increased 1.2 percentage points from the figure recorded in July. The uptick in manufacturing activities augurs well for the industry.Easing Supply Chain Disruptions: While supply-chain disruptions persist, especially related to the availability of electronic components, the situation has improved, as evident from the ISM report's Supplier Deliveries Index, which reflected faster deliveries for the 11th straight month in August. Easing supply chain issues should support manufacturing tools companies' growth in 2023. Cost-control measures support the margins of the industry participants despite inflationary pressure.Hefty Investments in Product Development: The industry participants constantly focus on innovation, product upgrades and development of new products to stay competitive in the market. While this bodes well for long-term growth, the hefty investments associated with it weigh on margins and profitability of these companies. Successive acquisitions to expand product portfolio, boost technological capabilities and extend geographical presence often leave these companies with a highly leveraged balance sheet.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #185. This rank places it in the bottom 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group's 2023 earnings per share has declined 52.1% over the past year.Despite the industry's dull near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks that you may want to hold in your portfolio. But before that, it's worth taking a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Underperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Manufacturing-Tools &amp; Related Products industry has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 composite index and the sector in the past year.Over this period, the industry has rallied 21.4%, compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 index's increase of 16.7% and 13.5%, respectively.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward P/E (F12M), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing tools and related product stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.43X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 19.44X. It is above the sector's P/E (F12M) ratio of 16.76X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.05X, as low as 10.98X and at the median of 16.18X.2 Manufacturing Tool Stocks to Keep a Tab OnThe stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

272,a3dc9d2b-1e6a-3e0e-b7d2-359c6e0a4606,NVDA,2023-09-08,Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-trimmed-price-targets-121344124.html,1694175224,STORY,"['TGT', '^GSPC', 'CPK', 'NEE', 'SJW', 'AAPL', 'NVDA', 'JD', 'D']","[In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently trimmed by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.Despite recent stock market challenges, Wall Street remains cautiously optimistic about potential returns in the coming months. In August, global stocks had their second-worst month of the year, dropping 2.96%. Rising bond yields and concerns about China's economy contributed to this decline. JPMorgan's Madison Faller believes 2023 can end on a positive note, reported CNBC. She notes that valuations have become more attractive after late-summer market turbulence, offering opportunities to rebuild equity exposure. Higher interest rates, driven by the Federal Reserve's actions, may create better bond entry points and protect against surprises. The debate on monetary policy has shifted from rate heights to how long central banks will keep them elevated. If inflation cools while rates stay high, it might set the stage for future rate cuts. Goldman Sachs has reduced the likelihood of a U.S. recession 2024 to 15%, supporting a ""soft landing"" scenario, which is typically favorable for equities. JPMorgan Private Bank shares a similar view, not anticipating a recession despite higher interest rates but rather a ""softish landing."" Consumers have maintained solid spending habits, with recent retail data showing resilience, albeit with some shifts toward thriftier options and goods. The latest earnings season brought positive surprises, with S&amp;P 500 earnings exceeding expectations and rising steadily. Companies increasingly focus on long-term growth, with AI investments surging across industries. Technology stocks, especially AI ones, have driven market gains this year, though selectivity remains essential. Companies with strong balance sheets, cash generation, and the ability to compound returns over time are gaining favor in a rising-rate environment. As interest rates rise, this trend benefits profitable, strong balance sheet tech companies over speculative, unprofitable counterparts.Story continuesOn September 7, US stock futures experienced a decline, and the dollar reached a six-month high as investors increased their expectations of further Federal Reserve policy tightening. Nasdaq 100 futures have fallen by 0.7%, with notable drops in premarket trading for companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), down approximately 2%. Concerns arose after news of China's intention to prohibit iPhones in certain government agencies, impacting US technology stocks, which have been at the forefront of this year's market gains. The rally in oil prices has paused as traders shift their focus to stockpile levels. After a nine-day winning streak, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil began to dip towards $87 per barrel. This remarkable run, the longest in over four years since January 2019, pushed prices into overbought territory. The surge was triggered by OPEC+ leaders' decision to extend supply cuts until the end of 2023, providing strong support to oil prices. However, the recent decline in oil prices comes as the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a substantial drop of 5.5 million barrels in US crude inventories. This suggests a potential rebalancing of supply and demand dynamics in the oil market, contributing to the overall sentiment among traders. While oil prices have paused, the market remains attentive to factors such as supply levels, geopolitical developments, and demand trends, which can influence the direction of crude oil prices in the coming months.On the stock market front, just like the drop in Nasdaq 100 futures in premarket trading for companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), analysts are bearish on several stocks by trimming their price targets. Check out the complete article to see details of these stocks.Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 10 Stocks10. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.47 (+0.44%)On September 6, RBC Capital revised its price target for Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK), setting a new target of $124, down from the previous $133. Furthermore, the investment firm has maintained its ""Sector Perform"" rating for its shares. This adjustment in the target price was driven by an update made by their analyst in response to the prevailing economic conditions, particularly a consistently higher interest rate environment. To reflect this persistent shift in interest rates, RBC Capital has reevaluated the valuation metrics for Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK) and other regulated utilities. Specifically, they have recalibrated the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples, which serve as a key determinant in assessing the value of these companies. In this recalibration, RBC Capital employs a 4.5% 10-year Treasury yield as the benchmark, a notable departure from previous valuation methods. The adjustment in P/E multiples significantly impacted the valuations of Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK) and similar utilities, resulting in a 13% reduction. This highlights how changes in interest rates can affect utility companies' perceived value to investors. In summary, RBC Capital lowered the price target and kept a ""Sector Perform"" rating for Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK) due to recalibrated valuation metrics driven by persistent high interest rates, leading to a notable decrease in assessed valuations.Just as the negative sentiment impacted premarket trading for Nasdaq 100 futures, with companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) seeing declines, analysts are adopting a bearish stance on Chesapeake Utilities Corporation (NYSE:CPK).09. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.51 (-0.77%)On September 6, RBC Capital revised its price target for NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), adjusting it from $90 to $89. Despite this slight reduction, the investment firm holds an ""Outperform"" rating for the company's shares. This revision in the price target results from RBC Capital's commitment to providing accurate and up-to-date assessments in response to prevailing economic conditions, particularly the consistent presence of higher interest rates. To better align with this enduring trend of elevated interest rates, RBC Capital's analyst has reviewed the valuation metrics applied to NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and other regulated utility companies. Specifically, the valuation multiples, including the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, have been recalibrated. This recalibration now incorporates a 4.5% yield on the 10-year Treasury as a reference point, a shift from previous valuation methodologies.The adjustment in the P/E multiples has notably impacted the perceived valuations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and similar utility firms. The new approach has resulted in a significant decrease of approximately 13% in the assessed valuations. This reduction highlights the pivotal role that changes in interest rates play in shaping the perceived value of utility companies for investors. In summary, RBC Capital's recent actions regarding NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) include slightly lowering the price target and retaining an ""Outperform"" rating. These changes stem from a recalibration of valuation metrics in response to the persistent presence of higher interest rates. This recalibration has led to a considerable reduction in the estimated valuations of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), emphasizing the importance of adapting to evolving economic conditions when evaluating investments in the utility sector.08. SJW Group (NYSE:SJW)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.67 (-1.05%)On September 6, RBC Capital adjusted its price target for SJW Group (NYSE:SJW), reducing it from $85 to $76. Despite this reduction, the investment firm has opted to maintain a ""Sector Perform"" rating for the company's shares. This change in the price target is a response to the ongoing economic environment characterized by consistently elevated interest rates. RBC Capital's analyst reviewed the valuation metrics applied to SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) and other regulated utility companies to align with this enduring trend of higher interest rates. Specifically, they recalibrated the valuation multiples, including the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, to incorporate a 4.5% yield on the 10-year Treasury as a benchmark. This marks a shift from previous valuation methodologies.The adjustment in the P/E multiples has notably impacted the perceived valuations of SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) and similar utility firms. This new approach has resulted in a substantial decrease of approximately 13% in the assessed valuations. This reduction underscores the significant influence that fluctuations in interest rates can have on the perceived value of utility companies from an investor's standpoint. In summary, RBC Capital's recent actions concerning SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) involve a price target reduction and retention of a ""Sector Perform"" rating. These adjustments were made in response to the enduring presence of higher interest rates, prompting a recalibration of valuation metrics. This recalibration has led to a significant decrease in the estimated valuations of SJW Group (NYSE:SJW), emphasizing the importance of adapting to evolving economic conditions when evaluating investments in the utility sector.07. JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.47 (-1.37%)On September 6, Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson opted to maintain his ""Hold"" rating for JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD), a prominent e-commerce company. However, he has made a downward adjustment to the price target, revising it from $42 to $39. This update from the analyst reflects his current assessment of JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) performance and potential within the market. While the ""Hold"" rating suggests a neutral stance, the reduced price target indicates a less optimistic outlook than the previous valuation. Similar to the decline in premarket trading of Nasdaq 100 futures affecting companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), market analysts hold a pessimistic outlook for JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD).Baron Emerging Markets Fund made the following comment about JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the three largest e-commerce platforms in China. Shares declined after the company reported a slowdown in fourth quarter sales and commented that deliberate culling of unprofitable SKUs would also be a drag on headline revenue growth in the first half of 2023. We believe the slowdown was driven by the peak in Chinese COVID lockdowns, which have since ended, and the elimination or reduction of unprofitable business is better for long-term margins and returns on capital. We remain investors.”06. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: -0.84 (-1.80%)As of September 6, Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell upheld a ""Neutral"" rating on Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), a significant energy company. However, he has made a notable downward adjustment to the price target, revising it from the previous target of $58 down to $46. This decision by the analyst reflects his current assessment of Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) performance and prospects in the market. While the ""Neutral"" rating suggests a relatively balanced view, the reduced price target indicates a more cautious outlook than the prior valuation. Analysts regularly update their assessments based on various factors, including company financials, market conditions, and industry developments, to provide investors with the most up-to-date guidance.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) traded lower following the surprise announcement of the company’s strategic review. The company is likely to sell several business units, which will impact future earnings. As a result of earnings uncertainty, we decided to sell the stock.” Click to continue reading and see Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price TargetsAnalysts on Wall Street Lower Ratings for These 10 Stocks10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street AnalystsDisclosure: None.

Robinson",FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reducing-waste-manual-touches-big-195545134.html,1694116545,STORY,['CHRW'],"[New CHRW CEO Dave Bozeman spoke to the TD Cowen Transportation conference. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)With the fall season for investment conferences kicking off within the first days after Labor Day, it also means that new C.H. Robinson CEO Dave Bozeman is taking to the road to make his case about how to engineer a rebound at the country’s largest 3PL.At the TD Cowen conference in Boston Thursday, Bozeman returned to many of the same themes that he addressed during his first quarterly earnings call with analysts in August, though with another month of experience under his belt. Bozeman took the helm at C.H. Robinson June 26.And for a company that already has engaged in several rounds of layoffs, the message came back again that Bozeman will be looking at costs and head count while expecting technology gains to replace the lost production from workers when the freight market rebounds, which he does not foresee until 2024.“I put out a challenge to the entire company which I called the ‘impede your speed’ challenge,” Bozeman said. The CEO was looking for input from employees as to what aspects of C.H. Robinson was impeding their speed in delivering services to their customers. Bozeman said he expected to get about 350 responses and instead got 3,400 from 2,400 employees.“What does that say?” Bozeman said. “That this is a company that has people in it that want to win, that like to win and to have ideas to help.”Using AI will be part of that solution, Bozeman said. But another aspect of his approach will be to use the lean management process.According to the Institute for Leadership Excellence, “This model of improving the work process by those who do the work, by those who are on-the-spot, is the essence of lean management.” The work team is asked to “think, to experiment, and to learn from the data. It is management that is humble and not arrogant. It is management that observes, encourages, challenges, and learns.” The term “continuous improvement” also comes up repeatedly in describing lean management.Lean “reduces waste” and cuts down on “manual touches,” Bozeman said. “It’s a big opportunity for us going forward, especially at our scale.”Story continuesCombining that with the capabilities of a “large language” model like generative AI “is game changing for a company like Robinson and we’re leaning into that,” Bozeman said. The vast amount of information that comes into C.H. Robinson every day can be looked at by workers and with the help of AI “can make that clean data tomorrow.”So far at C.H. Robinson, Bozeman sees “leaders actually implementing [lean management] within their business lines. I’m pretty happy about it because it’s a direct learning, of understanding how to see waste.”Lean utilizes a tool called value stream mapping. The Institute for Leadership Excellence defined it as “diagraming every step involved in the material and information flows needed to bring a product from order to delivery. It is a fundamental tool used in continuous improvement to identify and eliminate waste.”And Bozeman, discussing the progress lean management is making at C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), said, “I’ve never seen anyone go through a value stream map and not come out with opportunities to reduce waste.”At the Cowen meeting, CFO Mike Zechmeister said the cost-cutting steps at C.H. Robinson were originally envisioned to result in annualized savings of $150 million if the company hit the run rate of the third quarter of 2022, when revenue was $4 billion with an operating ratio of 32.4%, compared to second-quarter 2023 figures of $3 billion and 19.9%.But instead, the cost cuts have resulted in savings that are on target to be at an annualized basis of $300 million, Zechmeister said. He reiterated what the company said on its second-quarter earnings call: that a goal of a 15% improvement in productivity in 2023 had already reached 12% through the first half of the year.“I think we’ve got a lot going on in taking touches out, making our system more efficient and really continuing that investment during the tough part of the market,” Zechmestier said, adding that despite the troubled freight market, C.H. Robinson continues to generate free cash flow “and get us in position to be stronger when we come out.”C.H. Robinson was making its appearance just about a week after a downgrade to its stock, as well as that of publicly traded 3PL RXO (NYSE: RXO), by Susquehanna Financial Group. Both companies had their outlook downgraded to negative, while Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR), part 3PL, part asset company, saw its rating from Susquehanna hold at neutral.The C.H. Robinson stock is down about 5.2% since then.The core of the Susquehanna message was that freight demand is “seasonal at best, very little spot volume, contract rates pressured until spring bid season and truckload capacity stubbornly priced with spot rates below operating costs.”In its report, Susquehanna also said that C.H. Robinson’s business is about 20% based on LTL brokerage, where the pricing power continues to shift as a result of the closure of LTL carrier Yellow. That level of activity was called “moderate” by Susquehanna.Susquehanna referred to several signs that a bottom might be reached. Retail destocking “is near its end,” the analysis firm said, and there is data suggesting that truck transportation volume might be back at a seasonal norm.“But we believe it will take upside holiday sales to lift the cycle meaningfully into 2024,” Susquehanna said.Susqehanna also said routing guide depths remain at about 1.1 to 1.2 for C.H. Robinson, meaning shippers usually only need to go slightly past their contracted carriers in their routing guides to find capacity. That is a six-year low for Robinson.More articles by John KingstonWerner’s appeal of $100 million Texas verdict focuses on legal argumentsSentencing in Louisiana staged truck accident case now a December doubleheaderA first for Werner: Small group of workers votes to unionizeThe post Reducing waste, manual touches ‘big opportunity’ for C.H.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's 5 Activist Targets.Nelson Peltz is a popular name when it comes to activism on Wall Street. The billionaire investor has made a name for himself by serving several boards and pushing for drastic changes to unlock shareholder value. He helped cofound Trian Partners, a hedge fund focused on investing in high-quality but highly undervalued and underperforming public companies.Although Peltz is consistently open to cooperative efforts with management teams and boards to unlock value, he is not hesitant to initiate proxy battles when necessary. An average return of 38.12% since 2013 underscores why he is a revered activist investor on Wall Street.At the height of the bear run in 2022, Trian Partners was down by 10.6%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which ended the year down 19%. Trian's performance was much better, considering on average hedge funds lost 17.2% in 2022.As an activist investor, Peltz often lobbies for changes within companies he is engaged in proxy battles. For starters, he may push for higher dividends, share buybacks, cost cuts, and management changes. He may sometimes push for company dissolution or the sale of some units. After acquiring a $1.3 billion stake in PepsiCo Company in 2013, he called the CEO and demanded the company acquire Mondelez International, a company in which he owned $1 billion in stakes.After acquiring a 9.9% stake in asset manager Invesco and Janus Henderson in 2020, the activist investor pushed for a merger for the two companies. While the deal never materialized, he succeeded in turning Invesco's fortune around, with its operating margins and earnings more than doubling. While Janus did underperform, Peltz continued to ramp up stakes, becoming its largest shareholder after that.Story continuesIn the most recent past, Peltz has waged a proxy battle with Disney after formally launching a bid for a board seat. The activist investor insists he wants to rescue the company from what he calls a crisis of overspending on the streaming business, the purchase of 21st Century Fox, and failed succession planning. Peltz's latest onslaught is seen as a serious challenge to Bob Iger, one of the most famous executives who returned from retirement to lead the company for a second time.Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist TargetsNelson Peltz of Trian PartnersOur methodologyPeltz's activist campaigns have generated an average of 9.6% over the past 15 years. While some campaigns have been extremely successful, generating returns of more than 30%, some have been a disappointment, losing as much as 15%, as was the case with General Electric.We have compiled a list of some of the top activist campaigns engineered by the billionaire investor since founding Trian Partners in 2005. The campaigns are ranked chronologically based on when they occurred.Long-Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist Targets12.

The company also deals in hair care products such as shampoo, conditioner, and styling.Peltz started building a position in the British Consumer goods company in 2022. The activist investor has since pushed for management changes, having approached former CEOs of consumer goods companies to take up the top job at the Dove soap maker. He has also committed to helping drive Unilever's strategy operations sustainability and shareholder value.11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Activist Investment: 2022 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: -16.98% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 17.33%A conglomerate in the entertainment industry, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is best known for its leading role in creating and providing entertainment and information. The company also operates some of the biggest theme parks. The company saw a slew of activist investor activity in 2022, led by Peltz and Daniel Loeb.Peltz increased his stake in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in early 2023 in an attempt to gain sizable influence on the company's future roadmap. With his hedge fund Trian Partners, the activist investor was forced to end a proxy battle in February after Disney agreed to restructure its business and launch an effort to reduce costs by about $5.5 billion.With the changes, Peltz ended his quest for a board seat after CEO Iger laid out plans for cutting 7,000 jobs as part of the cost-cutting measures. The CEO has also agreed to consider the sale of the company's linear networks like ABC Freeform and National Geographic.10. Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ)Activist Investment: 2020 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: 142% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 45.38%Invesco Ltd.

Activist investor Peltz first took an interest in Invesco in 2020 and started engaging the company regarding various strategic and operational initiatives.The activist investor pushed for two board seats and discussed board refreshments. Through Trian Partners, the hedge fund manager also encouraged Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) to explore strategic combinations with one or more companies in asset management. Peltz wanted the company to merge with Janus, where he held some stakes.A proposed merger with Janus did not happen, and Peltz ended up stepping down from the board following his appointment to the Board of Janus Henderson Group. Trian Partners trimmed its stake in Invesco to 33.9 million in May 2023 from 55.6 million shares.9.

The activist investor first aimed at the company in 2017 and took a more surgical approach in lobbying for a single board seat.Peltz would later allege that The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) had wasted about $100 million to block his attempt to get on the board, terming it the dumbest thing.The activist investor would win the board seat with the slightest margin after waging one of the biggest proxy fights in the history of the $220 billion consumer goods giant.He joined the board, having struck a truce with the management agreeing to end the proxy fight. He would exit the board four years later, terming his tenure successful in creating tremendous value for all stakeholders.8. Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY)Activist Investment: 2015 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: 104% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 101%With its subsidiaries, Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) engages in marketing and distributing foods and other related products, small wares, kitchen equipment, and table-on items for restaurants. The company was the subject of an activist investor takeover in 2015 when Peltz confirmed a 7% stake in the giant food distributor.In its filing, Trian Partners reiterated that the company boasts several competitive operating and financial performance advantages but continued to underperform relative to its potential. In the regulatory filing, the hedge fund reiterated that it could adopt a strategic and operating initiative to improve margins and enhance working capital efficiency.Days after the announcement, Peltz got his wish and was added to the company's board. With his addition to the board, the activist investor pushed for an increase in dividends, the repurchase of shares, and the divestment of non-core business.7. Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) Activist Investment: 2013 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: 60.71% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 43%Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) manufactures, markets, and sells snack food and beverage products. Activist investor Peltz disclosed stakes in Mondelez in 2013 as the stock had tumbled significantly following the company's split from Kraft Foods.There were reports that the activist investor intended to push for a merger between Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and PepsiCo. The reports came at a time when PepsiCo was in the process of exploring restructuring options for its underperforming North American beverage business. Speculation was rife that it could buy Mondelez.Peltz discussed with Mondelez management the company's operations capital structure and corporate governance. In early 2014, Mondelez announced Peltz was to join the board after criticizing the company for doing little to cut costs. He joined the board as part of a compromise agreement that resulted in him ending his push to have PepsiCo acquire Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ).Peltz continued to rack up stakes in the company until 2015 but left the board in 2016, reiterating satisfaction with the progress made at the confectionery company.6. PepsiCo, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP) manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells various beverages and convenient foods worldwide. The company was the subject of an activist investment from Peltz in 2013 when it was undergoing restructuring amid struggles with its North American operations. The company was reviewing a potential spinoff of its beverage business, which remained a significant drag despite massive investments.In 2014, the activist investor renewed his struggle to force PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to spin-off the beverage unit from its flourishing snacks division.""Two leaner and more entrepreneurial companies"" through the spinoff would boost sales and margins in the snacks business, while the drinks business would generate a stable flow of cash that could be returned to shareholders, Peltz said.CEO Indra Nooyi shot down the spin-off efforts, insisting that a split up would hurt PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s ability to negotiate with retail customers. The feud only came to an end when PepsiCo agreed to allow a representative of Peltz's fund to join the board.Trian Partners exited its position in the beverage giant in 2016, three years after launching a campaign to have PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) split into two.Click to continue reading and see Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's 5 Activist Targets.Suggested articles:20 Best Companies to Work For in 2023100 Most Popular Songs of All Time on Spotify15 Countries That Produce the Most E-waste in the WorldDisclosure: None. Long-Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist Targets is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

It risks a backlash against both companies.“We’ve almost always avoided these kinds of disputes,” said Christopher Winfrey, president of Charter Communications, during a call with analysts and investors last week. “But we had to draw a line in the sand.“We respect the product that Disney produces, and its management team, but the video ecosystem is broken.”Charter, which boasts 32 million customers across 41 states, says it was left with no choice but to pull Disney’s channels following lengthy and difficult negotiations with Disney over a new contract.Story continuesThe company – which counts Liberty Media, Malone’s main business, as its top shareholder – says Disney is demanding more money for its channels but is refusing to give Charter’s customers access to its streaming service, Disney+.Malone, the billionaire businessman nicknamed the “Cable Cowboy” in the industry, is right to be wary.The rise of streaming services has led to a surge in so-called “cable cutting”, where US households cancel their expensive cable packages and opt for lower cost streaming instead. The trend threatens the bedrock of his business.Charter argues its customers are being double-charged for Disney programmes: once as part of access through their cable package, then again if they want to stream them.Disney also wanted to allow “even less flexibility” in how its channels are packaged up into bundles, Charter claimed.The company says it previously expected to pay Disney $2.2bn for content in 2023 but that the entertainment giant’s latest demands “ignore the realities of today’s video business”.John Malone's main business Liberty Media is the top shareholder in Charter Communications - REUTERS/Rick WilkingOver the last five years, the linear video industry – television broadcast to a schedule – has lost almost 25 million customers, or roughly 25pc of the previous total.“It’s staggering,” Winfrey remarked.Much of this is the result of services such as Netflix that have eroded the structural advantages enjoyed by linear TV providers in the past, says Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis.In large swathes of the US, only one or two cable TV and broadband providers are available, resulting in higher prices compared to the UK and less choice.A common practice has always been to bundle popular channels – such as Disney’s ESPN – together with less popular ones.But people are much less willing to pay for channels they won’t watch in an era of “a la carte” streaming services that allow them to choose what they watch and when.“For cable TV providers like Charter, it is about as bad as it has ever been,” says Harrington.Meanwhile, many of the traditional content producers that have long licensed channels and programming to cable TV services are themselves haemorrhaging cash as they go toe-to-toe with Netflix by launching their own streaming platforms.Disney+ offers viewers everything from traditional animated classics such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast to Marvel movies, Star Wars spin-offs and TV series like Atlanta.Yet in its most recent quarter alone, Disney’s streaming operation lost $512m – taking total losses since its 2019 launch to $11bn.Iger, who was the company’s boss from 2005 to 2020 and then returned last year, has been brought back to hammer its finances back into shape. Squeezing a little more money out of partners such as Charter can’t hurt.Rival services include Paramount+, Warner Bros Discovery’s MAX and NBCUniversal’s Peacock face similar problems.Many want to attract subscribers to their new streaming platforms by offering a library of content they can’t access elsewhere, while at the same time selling their content to cable TV providers.In some cases, this has resulted in attempts to get around exclusivity deals with cable TV companies in ways that have raised eyebrows.For example, CNN’s news programming is supposed to be broadcast first on the cable and satellite TV services it has deals with.However, the channel has opted to make exclusive programmes to go on HBO’s MAX service to circumvent these restrictions.Christopher Winfrey, president of Charter Communications, said the company was forced to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in its dealings with DisneyFor Disney and its competitors, the fees from linear TV remain a vital source of income – bringing in far more than streaming does.The Disney-Charter dispute should be seen in this context, says Harrington.“Cable TV companies are under stress. But Charter probably thinks that Disney is under pressure too, and has calculated they can push it a bit further than if things were going well,” he explains.“They also feel that Disney’s channels are not worth as much as they were during the last negotiations, because a lot of content is now on Disney+.”Also hanging over the negotiations is Disney’s refusal to guarantee that cable TV customers who already pay for the ESPN channel will be able to access a planned on-demand ESPN service without paying extra.“They want to require customers to pay twice to get content apps with the linear video they have already paid for,” Charter’s Winfrey said.The row has parallels with a separate dispute playing out across the Atlantic, with customary British twists.Here, the likes of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 have been grappling with pay TV providers and television manufacturers for years over so-called “prominence”, or where their own apps and content gets placed in key software menus.For years the BBC has occupied the prestigious channels such as 101 and 102 on set top box services such as Sky and Freeview, but there are currently no hard rules on where TV makers such as Samsung should place them on smart TV menus.Instead, manufacturers have struck deals that give companies like Netflix top billing – and even include “Netflix” buttons on their television remotes.This new broadcasting land grab is happening amidst a once-in-a-generation shift in how people watch things.Audiences are flocking online, particularly young people. Public service broadcasters are desperate to build up the following of their own services, including BBC iPlayer, ITVX and Channel 4 On Demand, amid a panic that they may be left behind by Hollywood juggernauts.Ian Katz, chief content officer at Channel 4, recently defended a slump in the broadcaster’s so-called linear audience numbers, insisting that he was prioritising its streaming platform instead.“Frankly, any broadcaster who obsesses about linear ratings now risks going the way of Kodak or Blockbuster – great brands that fail to notice that the ground was shifting under their feet,” he said at last month’s Edinburgh TV festival.Back in the US, experts say Charter’s high-stakes punch-up with Disney could end up smashing the traditional pay TV model.Disney, for its part, says it has offered “the most favourable terms on rates, distribution, packaging, advertising and more” in talks so far.“Charter has refused to enter into a new agreement with us that reflects market-based terms,” the company claimed.“We are on the edge of a precipice,” Winfrey said last week. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”With fists raised, the only question now is who will blink first.“We are on the edge of a precipice,” Winfrey said last week. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”In a new statement on Thursday night, Disney accused Charter of “abandon[ing] their consumers” but said it “stands ready to resolve this dispute”.Disney accused Charter of rejecting “multiple offers to extend negotiations before taking Disney Entertainment’s networks down” and said it had “proposed creative ways to make its streaming services available to Charter’s Spectrum TV subscribers.”The media giant said: “The question for Charter is clear: Do you care about your subscribers and what they’re telling you they want – or not?”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

With an estimated 15 million missing out on ESPN and live sports since the country’s largest cable carrier was unable to agree on terms with one of the dominant content providers, Winfrey was asked at a Goldman Sachs event on Thursday about a sportsless future. He called the possibility “more and more of a potential reality.”As of September 1, Charter took the unprecedented step of blacking out all Disney-owned channels on its cable boxes. Charter wants Disney to grant its customers free access to the Magic Kingdom’s various streaming services, such as Disney+ and ESPN+, arguing that the current financial model of cable television, where programmers receive a fee from cable companies who then pass the cost on to their consumers, no longer works in the days of a dying cable business.“We had to say enough is enough, or else we're gonna have to move on to a different model,” Winfrey said.Disney says Charter rejected multiple offers to extend negotiations and keep its channels on Charter’s airwaves, according to a company statement provided to Fortune.If Charter were indeed to move forward without Disney’s channels, its cable package would be a smaller, cheaper “general entertainment” package, Winfrey says. One of the main reasons for the pared-down version of cable is that without Disney’s sports juggernaut ESPN, Winfrey doesn’t think Charter would renew most of its other sports offerings. This would be a dramatic change for the TV business, as sports contracts from cable TV—led by the NFL’s $110 billion package with three major networks, ESPN and Amazon Prime—form the backbone of both the sports and TV industries.ESPN has been the big dog in cable TV for over a generation, commanding an average carrier fee of $9.42 per month, according to Sportico, from every cable subscriber, whether they actually watch the 24-7 sports channel or not. In fact, the high fees that ESPN commanded in the cable TV “bundle,” from sports and non-sports fans alike, was a major contributor to the cord-cutting era, the birth of Netflix, the streaming wars, and the epic entertainment saga that led to this moment.Story continuesWinfrey claims that the longer the dispute drags on, the less interest Charter has in reaching a deal with Disney at all. Winfrey reasons that any loss of customers in the meantime will actually help Charter’s business by revealing those who want a sports offering, which Charter can offer through either streaming or video-on-demand services, and its core general audience. In that scenario, he said, Charter would “be self-selecting for customers who are actually looking and willing to pay that type of price for sports content.”Winfrey essentially envisions a hybrid future for television in which streaming and linear are bundled together. He says legacy media companies—under pressure from Wall Street—cleaved their streaming and linear television business in two. “They're focused on direct-to-consumer businesses as if it was a completely separate business,” Winfrey said. “I don't think it's a separate business. You have to take a look at the two together; you have a consolidated set of cash flows.”Incumbents like Disney pursued the holy grail of a profitable streaming service by letting their “linear programming house burn to the ground,” he says. In what Winfrey considers to be a losing effort, those companies put their best content exclusively on their streaming services, thereby leaving the already struggling cable business even more impoverished—while consumers ended up worse off because they had to pay subscription fees for both cable and streaming services to watch everything they wanted. “The value of the big expanded package with everything loaded in and forcing it on customers who don't want, don't value, or can't afford that content is not going to work anymore,” he said.Winfrey outlined two other principal concerns with Disney: that programmers raise prices at a rate that’s faster than the consumer price index; and that rigid household minimums mean contracts force certain channels on consumers.When asked what progress the two parties had made, Winfrey was blunt. “If I had anything material to highlight, I would. That should tell you something in terms of you know how we're doing.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

It has recently witnessed a surge of 2.33%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 2.01%. However, fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Exelon Corp.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with EXC. Click here to check it out. EXC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of EXCExelon Corp (EXC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 7/103. Growth rank: 2/104. GF Value rank: 3/105. Momentum rank: 5/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Exelon Corp the GF Score of 64 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Exelon Corp: A Snapshot of Its BusinessExelon Corp, with a market cap of $40.59 billion, serves approximately 10 million power and gas customers at its six regulated utilities in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, and Washington, D.C. The company has reported sales of $19.89 billion and an operating margin of 17.75%. Despite its significant presence in the industry, the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, as indicated by the GuruFocus Score Rating, highlight the firm's potential for underperformance.Story continuesExelon Corp (EXC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength BreakdownExelon Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.22 positions it worse than 75.12% of 426 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.73, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 5.34, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 65.14% of 436 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Exelon Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -18.2 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 97.08% of 480 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Over the past five years, Exelon Corp has witnessed a decline in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The three-year growth rate is recorded at -13.8, while the five-year growth rate is at -5.5. These figures underscore potential challenges in the company's profitability. Lastly, Exelon Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Exelon Corp (EXC): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionDespite Exelon Corp's significant presence in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics indicate potential underperformance in the future. The GuruFocus Score Rating, which takes into account these factors, underscores the firm's potential for underperformance. Therefore, investors should exercise caution when considering this stock for their portfolio.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

For the current fiscal year, Under Armour expects revenues to be flat to slightly up. It expects the gross margin to be up 25-75 basis points, compared with the prior year's margin of 44.9%, backed by supply-chain tailwinds with respect to lower freight costs. The figure is likely to be partly offset by mix impacts stemming from higher off-price revenues and increased promotions in the company's DTC business. SG&amp;A expenses are anticipated to be flat to slightly up.Under Armour expects the operating income to be between $310 million and $330 million versus the comparable baseline period’s operating income of $284 million.UAA expects earnings in the band of 47-51 cents per share, down from 84 cents per share reported in fiscal 2023. The company reported adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share for the comparable baseline period. Capital expenditures are likely to come in the band of $250-$270 million.For the fiscal second quarter, revenues are likely to be flat to down slightly year over year, including a low single-digit fall in the company’s North American business. This will be partly offset by mid-single-digit increase in the international business. In addition, it anticipates the year's highest revenue growth rate in the fourth quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates revision.VGM ScoresCurrently, Under Armour has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B.

Dynamic M-ELO will leverage Artificial Intelligence to provide real-time changes to holding periods for M-ELO participants, which is set to improve fill rates and reduce market impact. The order type applies an AI model with over 140 factors and offers an average combined volume-weighted improvement of over 30% in testing. Dynamic M-ELO simultaneously enhances both liquidity and execution quality improvement outcomes, usually considered mutually exclusive, by adjusting dynamically to real-time market conditions.The traditional M-ELO order type was originally designed using a static holding period set to common, nonspecific market conditions. Through extensive research and market participant feedback, Nasdaq found that high-quality executions and protection against adverse selection are improved when the holding period is dynamically adjusted to real-time market conditions. Based on that research, Nasdaq developed the first real-time AI order type, Dynamic M-ELO, which has shown a 20.3% increase in fill rates and an 11.4% reduction in mark-outs1.""As part of our commitment to modernizing markets, Nasdaq takes a thoughtful long-term approach to technology adoption and advancement to ensure we drive innovation in a responsible manner"" said Tal Cohen, President of Market Platforms at Nasdaq. ""AI powered Dynamic M-ELO is a purpose built solution that encapsulates our ambition to cultivate the quality of our markets and underscores our commitment to delivering innovative products and tools that benefit all market participants.""Story continues""Through decades of investment and experience in underlying technological infrastructure and data standardization, Nasdaq is able to leverage new technology, including AI, to improve price discovery and market efficiency,"" said Kevin Kennedy, Executive Vice President, North American Trading Services at Nasdaq. ""Dynamic M-ELO delivers optimal outcomes to market participants by intelligently adapting to real-time market conditions, which improves overall execution quality and fill rates. As our clients operate in an increasingly dynamic market environment, we look forward to partnering and supporting them with best-in-class markets and innovative solutions.""In addition to the AI powered order type, Nasdaq also implemented predictive AI in its US options markets this year. The initiative was designed to improve overall efficiency and provide strike lists more aligned to market and client demand across all six of Nasdaq’s US options exchanges.With almost 1.5 million individual options symbols listed in the US, Nasdaq recognized a need to improve capabilities in determining new strike listings. Nasdaq's Strike Price Optimization Program analyzes the millions of possible daily symbols and uses predictive AI to estimate their potential demand. The program then determines which strikes are likely to trade and which are not, keeping total strikes listed flat while improving liquidity and internal operational efficiency. All changes suggested by the innovative AI-powered program are reviewed by human eyes daily to ensure accuracy and completeness. The new process streamlines the human power needed to determine new listings, which previously required daily manual analysis of millions of symbols.Please visit our website for more information on Dynamic M-ELO:https://www.nasdaq.com/docs/2023/09/07/1781-Q23_Dynamic%20M-ELO%201%20Pager_NAM-vf.pdfAbout NasdaqNasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a leading global technology company serving corporate clients, investment managers, banks, brokers, and exchange operators as they navigate and interact with the global capital markets and the broader financial system.

The U.S. crude benchmark hit a 10-month peak of $88.09 on Wednesday. With a net gain in three days versus two, WTI rose about 1% on the week, extending the prior week’s 7.2% rally.Brent hovered at $90.83 after settling Thursday at $89.22 for its first close beneath $90 since it got above that mark on Tuesday. For the week, the global oil benchmark rose 2.6%, extending the prior week’s 4.8% gain.Brent's rise to above $90 came with less than three weeks left for summer, the season Americans like driving the most. With the fall season of lower oil usage set to begin on Sept 23, crude prices would typically retreat a little, sometimes meaningfully, in the world’s largest consuming country.But that may not happen this time, not with the Saudi obsession of ultimately getting oil to $100 a barrel or beyond. The Arabs, who control much of the world’s oil exports, have been fixated on triple digit pricing since losing that advantage in August 2022, when Brent crude hovered above $105.Key to this is the 1.0-million-barrels-per day in additional cuts, on top of other existing production rationing, that the Saudis have been carrying out since July. By extending this till the year-end — and widening it with the help of Moscow which will cut 300,000 barrels per day of Russian production — the kingdom is hoping to create a different sort of market phenomenon for pricing.Fear of less oil for the market to play with was playing on traders’ minds, particularly with the approach of the weekend which tends to put the market on a hedging overdrive to attendant risks, said analysts.Story continues“Oil prices have consolidated a little as we’ve moved through the week but the trend remains very positive for crude, backed once again by the decision from Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend supply restrictions to the end of the year,” observed Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.“A lot more oil [is] off the market at a time when it’s clearly quite tight, albeit with a global economic outlook that is highly uncertain. Demand may still wane but traders appear to be working on the assumption of soft landings and mild recessions at worst. China is another unknown with slow and steady growth, by its standards, looking like the path ahead.”Data on Thursday showed overall Chinese exports and imports fell in August, as sagging overseas demand and weak consumer spending squeezed businesses.However, even in times of lackluster economic activity, China tends to bolster its storage capacity, particularly with the availability of cheap Russian crude. Last month, Chinese crude imports rose nearly 31%.Meanwhile, questions remain about whether central banks in the United States and Europe will continue their aggressive interest rate hike campaigns to tame persistent inflation.""Riyadh is acutely aware of the tightrope it walks between tightening the market and upsetting any up-and-until-now progress achieved by central banks in taming price-rise driven inflation,"" John Evans of oil broker PVM said in comments carried by Reuters.(Ambar Warrick contributed to this item)Related ArticlesOil up 2nd week in row as supply scare cows marketOil prices up 1% to 9-month high on worries about tight supplyUS says it disrupts illicit oil shipment by Iran's IRGC, seizes contraband crude]"

Now, talks are scheduled to start on Sept. 30, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said at a Goldman Sachs event on Wednesday.The sped-up deal would settle what’s long been a looming question for the businesses of both Comcast and Disney.Comcast currently owns one-third of Hulu, with the remaining two-thirds belonging to Disney. Either company can force a sale of Comcast’s stake to Disney, at a minimum valuation of $27.5 billion for all of Hulu. But Roberts believes that Hulu is “way more valuable” than that figure, agreed to five years ago, would indicate. He suggested the service would fetch a higher price on the open market, citing its status as the second-most popular streaming service after Netflix, with hit shows including Only Murders in the Building and a reboot of Futurama. “No one’s ever sold or auctioned off a pure play streaming asset that’s in this kind of position,” Roberts said. “That’s a scarce kingmaker asset for whoever would get that.”An eventual deal would get the owner all the content currently on Hulu and, crucially for Disney, the ability to continue bundling the service with their ESPN+ and Disney+ services. The bundle, in particular, is valuable, because it helps reduce churn, which is when consumers cycle in and out of a subscription based on what content is available, Roberts said.“We’re selling all of this as if there’d be a line of bidders around the block to actually buy all the content, all the bundling of Hulu,” Roberts said. “Usually, buyers in robust auctions pay for all the benefits of the synergy.”Disney CEO Bob Iger had previously stressed the importance of combining Hulu’s content with that of Disney’s other streamers. In April he said Disney was considering putting Hulu’s content on its flagship Disney+ streaming service. Several months before that he’d indicated that Disney was exploring a variety of options for Hulu. “Everything is on the table,” he told CNBC.Story continuesThe process would see each company hire an appraiser to evaluate Hulu’s value. If their respective estimates are far apart, a third appraiser would be hired. The first option to sell or buy Hulu would present itself 30 days after the start of negotiations, Roberts said.The proceeds of an eventual sale would go back to Comcast’s investors in the form of stock buybacks, Roberts said. Comcast has been engaged in an expansive buyback program over the past year or so. Last September, Comcast’s board approved a $20 billion buyback program. At the time it had already repurchased $9.0 billion worth of its shares from investors.

The program is supported by a $150,000 grant from Comcast that will be used to hire and train nearly a dozen CCBC students.(PRNewsfoto/Comcast Cable)The CCBC Digital Navigators will focus on addressing barriers households face to getting online – namely affordability, access to devices, and digital skills. Digital Navigators are trained to educate residents – including the thousands of CCBC students returning to campus this fall in need of high-speed Internet for schoolwork and job searches – about resources available to overcome these obstacles.In addition, Comcast is offering exclusive Internet deals and spreading the word about eligibility for the federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides qualifying individuals with a $30/month benefit toward their Internet bill. Thanks to ACP, eligible Comcast customers can get home Internet either through Comcast's Internet Essentials or Internet Essentials Plus at no cost once the Federal credit is applied. Internet Essentials customers can also add a line of unlimited 5G cellular data ($45) through Xfinity Mobile for as little as $24.95/month after the ACP benefit is applied. The ACP benefit could save them up to $360 a year, which means lower expenses and lower student loans to pay for their educations.""We thank Comcast for their continued investment in our community and their commitment to driving innovative approaches to bridging the digital divide,"" said Dr. Sandra L. Kurtinitis, President of the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC). ""A major impact of this partnership will be assuring that CCBC students are connected at home as well as on campus. Internet affordability should not be a barrier to academic and career-long success.""Story continuesThe Digital Navigator model is a highly effective and research-driven approach that engages trusted community organizations to address the root causes of the digital divide – including access to the Internet, technology, and digital skills – the essential foundations for broadband adoption. A recent study from the Boston Consulting Group surveyed more than 1,500 people nationwide who used Digital Navigator services and revealed the critical role Digital Navigators play in closing the digital divide and reducing socioeconomic inequalities. Key takeaways include:More than 65% of survey respondents said they obtained Internet access or a computer or tablet at home; among Hispanic and Black Americans, this increased to 72%.More than 85% of all respondents said they used the Internet more frequently.Almost half surveyed obtained better healthcare, and 40% received support with basic needs like food, rent, and housing.1 in 3 found a new job or earned a higher income.""Closing the digital divide in Baltimore County remains a top priority for my administration, and we are committed to ensuring all of our residents have access to the tools they need to be successful and stay connected,"" said Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski. ""The Digital Navigator Program will build on our strong partnerships with CCBC and Comcast and help students and community members get connected, learn about new technology, and share digital literacy skills.""Comcast is deeply committed to advancing digital equity in the communities it serves. The company's community partnerships in Maryland over the past three years have totaled $28.8 million in cash and in-kind contributions to more than 187 local non-profits. This investment includes the installation of more than 40 Lift Zones in Maryland, which provide free WiFi service to local community centers to expand access to digital skills learning opportunities.""Comcast is proud to partner with CCBC to empower members of its student body to get more Baltimoreans connected to the Internet,"" said Michael Parker, Senior Vice President for Comcast's Beltway Region. ""Deep partnerships are needed to ensure we are reaching and connecting those in need, and that's why collaborating with CCBC is so critical as we work to accelerate digital access and adoption.""The CCBC Digital Navigator program – which is part of Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity – builds on Comcast's continued partnership with Baltimore County to bridge the digital divide. Earlier this year, Comcast and Baltimore County announced the latest phase of a rural broadband expansion which will bring high-speed Internet to 99% of previously unserved residences in Northern Baltimore County.About Comcast Corporation  Comcast Corporation (Nasdaq: CMCSA) is a global media and technology company.

(NYSE:PRU) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 57% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Prudential Financial, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Prudential Financial. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Prudential Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Prudential Financial. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 10% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.9% and 4.6% of the stock.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Prudential Financial, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$60m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 43% stake in Prudential Financial. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Prudential Financial better, we need to consider many other factors.

(NYSE:URI) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for United Rentals The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.73bUS$2.78bUS$2.63bUS$2.67bUS$2.67bUS$2.68bUS$2.71bUS$2.74bUS$2.79bUS$2.83bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.21%Est @ 0.50%Est @ 0.99%Est @ 1.34%Est @ 1.58%Est @ 1.75% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.1kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$18bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.8b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.2%) = US$46bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$46b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$20bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$38b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$475, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Rentals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.265. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United RentalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Trade Distributors market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $12.45 billion, indicating an increase of 8.82% on a year-over-year basis.Oracle expects non-GAAP earnings per share growth rate on a year-over-year basis in the range of 8-12% at cc and $1.15-$1.15 per share in USD.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at $1.14 per share in the past 30 days, suggesting a 10.68% increase from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Over the trailing four quarters, Oracle’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the mark once, with the average surprise being 1.76%.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderAccelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter.The acquisition of Cerner in 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, is expected to have bolstered the company’s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services.For the fiscal first quarter of 2024, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 28% to 30% at cc and from 29% to 31% in USD.Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL’s quarterly performance.The general availability of MySQL HeatWave Lakehouse is expected to have aided the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Mettler-Toledo International (NYSE:MTD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Mettler-Toledo International with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International How Fast Is Mettler-Toledo International Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Mettler-Toledo International has managed to grow EPS by 22% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Mettler-Toledo International shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 28% to 30%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Mettler-Toledo International's forecast profits?Story continuesAre Mettler-Toledo International Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Mettler-Toledo International, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$391m. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Mettler-Toledo International, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Mettler-Toledo International's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$6.2m in the year leading up to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Mettler-Toledo International Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Mettler-Toledo International's strong EPS growth. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. The overarching message here is that Mettler-Toledo International has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. Before you take the next step you should know about the 1 warning sign for Mettler-Toledo International that we have uncovered.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Also, solid performance in Health Solutions, especially in EMEA, Latin America and the United Kingdom is benefiting the stock.Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Aon provides risk management services, insurance and reinsurance brokerage, human resource consulting and outsourcing services worldwide. It has a market cap of $66.8 billion and operates in more than 120 countries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan It Retain Momentum?The answer is yes, thanks to rising estimates, growing operating strength and its profitability-increasing initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share currently stands at $14.26, signaling a 6.5% year-over-year increase. It has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past month against none in the opposite direction. AON beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed on the other occasions, with an average surprise of 0.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $13.3 billion, indicating a 6.2% year-over-year rise. Over the long run, AON expects to witness mid-single-digit or more organic growth. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is poised for long-term growth on the back core business strengthening initiatives, inorganic growth strategies and improving operations in different regions.It is expected to witness improvement in performance in most of its revenue lines in the coming days. Our estimate for 2023 Commercial Risk Solutions revenues indicates 4.5% year-over-year growth, on the back of strong operations in different geographical locations, mostly in Asia and Pacific regions. We expect there’s more room for growth in Commercial Risk than it has witnessed so far.Similarly, its Reinsurance Solutions unit is expected to grow from Strategy and Technology Group performance. We expect the unit’s 2023 revenues to grow 10.5% year over year. Continued growth in EMEA, Latin America and the United Kingdom is expected to boost its Health Solutions revenues. Our estimate for the unit’s 2023 revenues indicates a more than 6% increase from a year ago. The company’s focus on these two units is reflected in its talent investments.Story continuesManagement does not shy away from getting rid of less profitable assets to increase profitability. Historically speaking, in the 2011-2021 period, it completed 123 divestments for around $5.7 billion. We expect the company’s business streamlining moves to continue, allowing it to focus on more profitable operations and generate higher returns. AON’s trailing 12-month return on capital of 29.1% compares favorably with the industry average of 11.8%.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that can hold back AON’s growth. Lack of M&amp;A and IPO activities, which provides insurance contracts from non-recurring businesses, are expected to keep its growth potential under check in the second half of the year. Also, its debt-laden balance sheet induces a rise in interest expenses. In the first half of 2023, interest expenses escalated 25% year over year. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive its long-term growth.Key Picks in FinanceSome better-ranked players in the broader Finance space include Aegon N.V.

If you would like to skip our detailed analysis of the US dessert industry and its emerging trends, you can go straight to the 5 Most Popular Desserts in America.Desserts are essential to the American lifestyle, showcased by the dessert industry's market size. As reported by Grand View Research, the US's frozen dessert market had a valuation of $31 billion as of 2021, with the market size expected to grow by a CAGR of 4.6% up until 2030. The global industry of the same, on the other hand, has a market value of $92 billion as of 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period of 2022-2030, according to Polaris Research. Globally speaking, the largest market for frozen desserts is located in North America, with Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) and General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) being some of the most prominent players in the industry. As consumers begin paying more attention to their health and wellness, the dessert industry has received a higher demand for both low-fat as well as gluten-free products. The need for clean-label products is pushing corporations to adopt innovative methods in an attempt to grow their consumer base. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) owns two of the biggest names in the US ice cream industry, Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Talenti. As occurrences of lactose intolerance grow, so does the demand for dairy-free products. In November of 2022, Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) announced that it would be looking into the production of ice cream free from cow dairy. The company is now delving into dairy proteins made via a process known as precision fermentation in order to appeal to a larger segment of the population as well as keep up with changing market trends. The company also aims to reduce its carbon footprint through this process as a way to contribute to its broader goal of becoming net zero by 2039. Currently, its ice cream products contribute to 30% of the greenhouse gas emissions that Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is responsible for. The giant corporation also plans to expand its ice cream sales in the coming years, especially by focusing on already established brands like Ben &amp; Jerry’s. Story continuesGeneral Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) owns Häagen-Dazs, an ice cream brand revered not just in the US but worldwide. The corporation generated a revenue of $18.9 billion in 2022. General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) has also updated its product portfolio with many items that are ‘organic’ and contribute to the growing demands for simplicity in food products. They’re made from fewer and simpler ingredients yet attract a wide range of audience. Häagen-Dazs itself has made several innovations in trying to appeal to the growing demand for desserts as snacks, with the latest step being the introduction of butter cookie cones. The company has also moved into the yogurt aisle with the launch of yogurt products, ensuring they’re cashing in on all the latest market demands. Steps like these showcase that the company is trying to diversify its range and branch out from one product by offering some of the most popular desserts in America. Players like Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT) have also upturned the global dessert market, selling 1.63 billion doughnuts globally in 2022. In the first quarter of the year 2023, the company’s net revenue grew 12.5%. The US market is a massive contributor to the overall growth of Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT). The CEO mentioned that the company’s campaigns for special events like Valentine’s Day and St. Patrick’s Day, along with their specialty offerings, were the main drivers behind such a solid first quarter of the year. In addition, Baron Growth Fund has made some interesting comments about Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT) in their Q2, 2023 investor letter:“We continued to increase our holdings in Krispy Kreme, Inc. (NASDAQ:DNUT), an omni-channel manufacturer and retailer of doughnuts. Krispy Kreme sells its product through its owned and franchised doughnut shops, in grocery and convenience stores through its Delivered Fresh Daily (DFD) network, and via e-commerce in U.S. and non-U.S. markets. The company also owns Insomnia Cookies, a digital-first brand specializing in cookies and focused on young consumers.Krispy Kreme is successfully executing its plan to grow fresh points of access by 10% to 15% annually. It now services over 12,000 points of access globally by leveraging 400 doughnut producing hubs worldwide. In its most recently reported quarter, the company grew revenue at 14.4% organically as it benefited from price increases and premium seasonal innovation, including strong Valentine’s and St. Patrick’s Day offerings. Krispy Kreme continued to expand its capabilities to offer specialty doughnuts across channels, with e-commerce a key beneficiary of this investment. We are encouraged by the results, with e-commerce revenue growing 23% year[1]over-year and now approaching 20% of total company sales.In the U.S., the company expanded its footprint in traditional DFD locations while also demonstrating its ability to execute on new growth opportunities. We are particularly excited by an expanded trial at McDonald’s in the Louisville, Kentucky area. The company was able to add over 160 McDonald’s locations serviced by three local hubs with no disruption to existing locations or sales in the area.Internationally, Krispy Kreme is on track to have a presence in up to seven new countries in 2023, with an additional three to five in 2024. The company’s total pipeline of new hubs and fresh shops from franchise partners now exceeds 1,000 shops, which will be used to unlock additional points of access over the next five years. As the company continues to execute on its international expansion plan and domestic growth opportunities like the potential McDonald’s partnership, Krispy Kreme’s ability to expand from 12,000 points of access to 75,000 points of access should drive outsized top-line and EBITDA growth.”Desserts have made their way into every part of the food industry, instead of being limited to specific dessert chains. In the restaurant world, around 60% of operators claim that they have made desserts a regular part of their menu as a means to drive sales and generate further profits. Companies like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) sell a range of desserts alongside their regular menus in an attempt to offer the complete meal experience to their consumers. As the demand for desserts continues to heighten, along with an increased requirement for healthy alternatives, the dessert industry has multiple avenues to grow and innovate in the coming months of the year. Let's now head over to the list of the most popular desserts in America.20 Most Popular Desserts in AmericaPixabay / Public DomainOur MethodologyTo devise the rankings for the most popular American desserts, we have taken a consensus approach based on mentions on Reddit. The more times a dessert was mentioned by a Redditor, the higher it has been ranked on the list. Based on the number of mentions, each dessert has been given a score from 1-20. Based on this factor, here is the list of the 20 most popular desserts in America according to our analysis:Most Popular Desserts in the US:20. Fudge Score: 0114.24% of restaurants offer some form of fudge dessert on their menus. Some of the most popular pairings for the dessert are with cakes, ice creams, and sundaes, all using it in its melted form. This is also why the hot fudge sundae by McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is considered such a popular dessert. 19. Moon PiesScore: 02Moon pies were originally invented in 1917 as a snack for coal miners and are mainly produced in Tennessee today. The Chattanooga Bakery is primarily responsible for the production of this snack-like dessert and often makes up to a million moon pies a day. 18. Candy BuckeyesScore: 03Buckeye candies are most popular in the state of Ohio, especially during the holidays and the football season. The heightened demand for snack desserts is what has led to the increase in popularity of bite-shaped desserts like these. The dessert is named so after Ohio’s state tree, the buckeye. 17. Cookie CakeScore: 04The cookies and cakes market was worth $31.20 billion in 2022. Cookies are one of the most popular desserts in America, and the country especially loves baked goods. The two combine to bring this generous dessert loved by many across the board. The hybrid dessert originated in Atlanta and has tremendously grown in popularity to become the face of college sports recruiting processes.  16. Carrot Cake Score: 05Carrot cakes first gained popularity in the 70s and, since then, have emerged as a classic American dessert that many consider an integral part of the culture. Many food chains have added the dessert to their menus, including giant names like Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX). 15. Bananas FosterScore: 06Bananas are among the most consumed fruits in the US; hence, one of the most popular American desserts uses this fruit in the recipe. The country’s banana imports reached roughly $2.4 billion in 2021, which makes the fruit popular in many dishes. The dessert, Bananas Foster, first emerged from a creole-inspired restaurant in New Orleans: Brennan’s. It has since stood the test of time and is still widely popular today. 14. Funnel CakeScore: 07The funnel cake is a staple in the state of Pennsylvania, where it was first brought by German-speaking immigrants. The cakes are especially popular with restaurants and dessert sellers because they cost little to produce and can be sold at a high profit margin. Companies like J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp (NASDAQ:JJSF) have made huge earnings from selling funnel cakes, with the company earning $26.9 million from the cake in 2022. 13. Peanut Butter Cups Score: 08Peanut butter cups are among the most liked desserts among Americans, particularly ones manufactured by Reese’s. Reese's is owned by The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) and generates more than $2 billion in annual sales for the company. The Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are a top-selling candy in the US, becoming another dessert popular because of its snack-sized portions. Coming in various sizes and variations, the peanut butter cups became an immediate success for The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) as soon as it was introduced.12. Banana PuddingScore: 09This is another one of the most popular American desserts that showcases the country’s love for bananas. The US consumption of bananas is 27 pounds per person annually, some of which can be attributed to the desserts they eat. Banana pudding recipes first started getting popularized after the Civil War and quickly grew to become a popular dessert, especially in the Southern part of the US. 11. Peach CobblerScore: 10The state of Colorado is famous for the peaches produced in its town of Palisade, the farming of which can reach up to 30 million pounds annually. Peaches account for 75% of the total fruit production in Colorado; hence, they are a popular choice for desserts like peach cobbler. 10. Pumpkin PieScore: 11In multiple surveys conducted across the US, pumpkin pie takes the spot as the second most popular pie for Thanksgiving, often coming in at first place as well. Pumpkin pies are great seasonal desserts at places like McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). The popularity of the fruit itself around the fall season has also led to Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) introducing many pumpkin pie-flavored drinks. 9. Pecan PieScore: 12Pecan pie follows closely behind pumpkin pie as one of the most popular American desserts for the holiday season. The official meal of the state of Oklahoma includes pecan pie as the dessert, and some of the earliest recipes can be traced back to the state of Texas. Pecan pie has a very ‘American’ history, which has led to it becoming such a popular dessert in the modern-day US. 8. Brownies Score: 13Brownies is one of the most favorite desserts of America. According to Forbes, the origination of brownies can be credited to the state of Illinois, specifically the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. The COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to the trend of baking at home, which made brownies very popular due to their easy-to-bake nature. The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY) cocoa powder is one of the most popular choices for home-baked brownies, generating enormous profits for the company. 7. Key Lime PieScore: 14The Key Lime Pie is named after the key limes that naturally grow in the region of Florida Keys, making the dessert one of the most iconic ones to originate from the area. Many visitors tend to visit the region in search of the authentic taste of the key lime pie. 6. Red Velvet Cake Score: 15The global cake mixes market was worth $1.033 billion in 2022 and is predicted to have a CAGR of 2.88%.

335,fac40a4c-7c16-3532-adf4-08ada8b18441,STX,2023-09-08,Seagate Announces Pricing of $1.3 Billion of Exchangeable Senior Unsecured Notes,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seagate-announces-pricing-1-3-110000464.html,1694170800,STORY,['STX'],"[FREMONT, Calif., September 08, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Seagate HDD Cayman (the ""Company""), a subsidiary of Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ: STX) (""Seagate""), announced that it priced its earlier announced offering of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2028 (the ""Notes""). The 2028 Notes were priced at 100% of the aggregate principal amount and will bear interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum. In addition, the Company has granted the initial purchasers of the Notes an option to purchase up to an additional $200 million aggregate principal amount of Notes for settlement within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes are first issued, solely to cover over-allotments. The Notes will be guaranteed by Seagate and Seagate Technology Unlimited Company.The Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders only under certain circumstances and solely into cash up to the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be exchanged, and cash, ordinary shares of Seagate, or a combination of both, at Seagate’s election, in respect of any remainder of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of such principal amount. The initial exchange rate for the Notes is 12.1253 ordinary shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $82.47 per share, which represents an exchange premium of approximately 30% to the last reported sale price of the ordinary shares on The Nasdaq Global Market on September 7, 2023).In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company and Seagate entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers in the Note offering or their respective affiliates and/or other financial institutions (the ""option counterparties"") having an expiration date that is the same as the maturity date of the Notes. The capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of Seagate’s ordinary shares initially underlying the Notes and are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to Seagate’s ordinary shares and/or offset any cash payments, in each case, that the Company is required to make upon exchange of the Notes in excess of the principal amount thereof in the event that the market value per ordinary share, as measured under the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, with such reduction or offset being subject to a cap. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $107.8480 per share, which represents a premium of 70% over the last reported sale price of the ordinary shares of $63.44 per share on The Nasdaq Global Market on September 7, 2023. If the initial purchasers of the Notes exercise their over-allotment option, the Company expects to enter into additional capped call transactions with the option counterparties.Story continuesThe Company expects that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Seagate’s ordinary shares and/or purchase Seagate’s ordinary shares concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of ordinary shares or the Notes at that time. In addition, the Company expects that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Seagate’s ordinary shares and/or by purchasing or selling Seagate’s ordinary shares or other securities of the Company in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during the final observation period related to an exchange of the Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of the ordinary shares or the Notes, which could affect the ability of holders to exchange their Notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to an exchange of the Notes, it could affect the amount of cash that holders will receive upon exchange of their Notes.The Notes are being sold in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The sale of the Notes is expected to close on September 13, 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.The Company intends to use approximately $1.1 billion (or approximately $1.3 billion if the initial purchasers exercise their over-allotment option in full) of the net proceeds from the Notes to repay existing indebtedness, including portions of the Company’s outstanding term loans and/or senior notes. The remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures and other investments in the business.This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 0.95%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 11.11%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Newell Brands Inc.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NWL. Click here to check it out. NWL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NWLUnraveling the Challenges Ahead for Newell Brands Inc (NWL)Deciphering the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 4/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 2/104. GF Value rank: 8/105. Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Newell Brands Inc the GF Score of 64 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Newell Brands Inc's BusinessNewell Brands Inc is an American global consumer goods company with a market cap of $4.08 billion. The business activities of the group function through five segments namely, Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances, Home Solutions, Learning and Development, Outdoor and Recreation. The Learning and Development segment generates most of the revenue for the firm which offers baby gear and infant care products; writing instruments, including markers and highlighters, pens and pencils; art products; activity-based adhesive and cutting products, and labeling solutions. The company's sales stand at $8.546 billion with an operating margin of 4.83%.Story continuesUnraveling the Challenges Ahead for Newell Brands Inc (NWL)Financial Strength BreakdownNewell Brands Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 1.56 positions it worse than 85.97% of 1354 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.67, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.05 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 52.72, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 97.99% of 1346 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Newell Brands Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -0.4 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 73.09% of 1713 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Newell Brands Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Challenges Ahead for Newell Brands Inc (NWL)ConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Newell Brands Inc has a rich history and a diverse product portfolio, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Shares have lost about 9.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UPS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Earnings Beat at UPS in Q2UPS reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $2.54 which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 but declined 22.8% year over year. Revenues of $22,055 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,879.7 million but decreased 10.9% year over year. The overall adjusted operating profit fell 18.4% year over year to $2,919 million in the second quarter.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues decreased 6.9% year over year to $14,396 million in the second quarter, driven by a 9.9% decrease in average daily volume, partially offset by a 3.3% increase in revenue per piece. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) fell 9.4% year over year to $1,681 million in the reported quarter. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 11.7% in the second quarter.Revenues at the International Package division summed $4,415 million, down 13% year over year. The downfall was due to a 6.6% reduction in average daily volume and continued softness on Asia trade lanes. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) totaled $902 million in the reported quarter, down 25% year over year. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 20.4% in the second quarter.Supply Chain and Freight revenues of $3,244 million fell 23.4% year over year due to market rate and volume declines in forwarding, partially offset by growth in logistics, including healthcare. Operating profit (on an adjusted basis) fell 35% to $336 million in the second quarter. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 10.4% in the second quarter.Story continues2023 OutlookFor 2023, UPS now anticipates revenues to be around $93 billion (prior view: $97 billion). The consolidated adjusted operating margin is now expected to be around 11.8% (prior view: 12.8%).  Capital expenditures are still anticipated to be around $5.3 billion. Further, UPS anticipates dividend payments of $5.4 billion and share repurchases of $3 billion for the year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -15.99% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, UPS has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise UPS has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(UPS) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-attracting-130006740.html,1694091606,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this package delivery service have returned -9.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, which UPS falls in, has lost 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.21 per share, indicating a change of -26.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -16% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.70 points to a change of -25% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.46 indicates a change of +7.8% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UPS is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of UPS, the consensus sales estimate of $22.09 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.6%. The $92.98 billion and $97.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -7.3% and +5.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $22.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11%. EPS of $2.54 for the same period compares with $3.29 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.61%. The EPS surprise was +1.2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.17%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.89%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the credit card issuer and global payments company had lost 3.55% over the past month.

On that day, American Express is projected to report earnings of $2.98 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 20.65%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.43 billion, up 13.82% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.13 per share and revenue of $60.81 billion. These totals would mark changes of +12.99% and +15.04%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for American Express should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

346,cb0f2a8d-1010-393d-b45a-a46d36771b0b,AXP,2023-09-08,Middle-Class Boosting Spending Power: ETFs Likely to Gain,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/middle-class-boosting-spending-power-170000508.html,1694106000,STORY,['AXP'],"[After enduring a year and a half of elevated inflation, America's middle class is beginning to witness a restoration in their spending power. However, this resurgence still falls short of pre-pandemic levels. A recent household budget index introduced by Primerica, a financial services company, indicates that middle-income households (earning between $30,000 and $130,000 annually) experienced a rise in purchasing power to 97.5% in July, up from 97% the previous month.Moderate Recovery and Lingering DeficitsThe purchasing power of Americans reached a low point of 85.6% in June 2022 due to high inflation, a significant drop from its peak of 102.8% in November 2020. This decline signifies a loss of six years' worth of purchasing power gains within just 18 months.The latest increase in purchasing power follows a period of high credit card debt. However, Primerica CEO Glenn Williams acknowledged the incremental progress as they have “seen inflation slow down, and earned incomes begin to increase. Both are positives compared to the way things were previously.""Prolonged Deficit &amp; Still-Present Credit Card ChallengesThe index, which spans 55 months dating back to 2019, reveals that middle-income households have operated with a spending deficit for roughly 44 out of those 55 months. This suggests that for a considerable period, families have been dealing with insufficiency in their income.Hence, the recent gains achieved in the spending power could be fleeting. Recent reports indicate credit card balances surpassed $1 trillion and marked a record high. Moreover, a significant portion of credit card borrowers (51%) have been unable to pay off their entire balance each month, resulting in accruing interest.Good News for Retailers Before the Holiday Season?Though credit card challenges and deficits are concerning, any improvement in spending pattern prior to the holiday season should benefit retailers and consumer discretionary companies. Hence, investors should keep a close tab on the following ETFs.Story continuesETFs in FocusProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN)Online sales should be in demand due to more prevalence of deals over there. The underlying ProShares Online Retail Index is a specialized retail index that tracks retailers that principally sell online or through other non-store channels (read: ETF Areas &amp; Stocks to Win on Upbeat July Retail Sales).SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT)The fund puts about 24% of its weights in the fund XRT. Clothing sales have been dominant in latest retail sales. Sales in this segment increased 2.2% year over year and 1.0% sequentially in July. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Global X FinTech ETF FINXAmericans are expected to rely on buy now, pay later (BNPL) methods this holiday season amid inflationary concerns and high credit card balances. Some shoppers will resort to buy now and pay later financing to make last-minute purchases, peaking at a record 9% the week before Christmas (per a source). Such a trend would benefit the fintech ETF FINX.ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF IPAYThe fund should stand to gain amid inflationary pressure as it has solid exposure to companies like American Express AXP, Visa V and Mastercard MA. These companies’ business model is inflation friendly. Merchants are charged a percentage of every card transaction. As the price of goods and services rises, bill amounts also go up and companies like AXP and Visa get a share of fatter bills. Note that higher credit card balances mean increased card transactions too (read: ETF Strategies to Beat Inflation &amp; Follow Warren Buffett).   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

347,8b3604d9-d049-362c-a485-a731fc712733,AXP,2023-09-08,American Express Company (AXP) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-axp-trending-130006429.html,1694091606,STORY,['AXP'],"[American Express (AXP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this credit card issuer and global payments company have returned -3.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, which American Express falls in, has lost 1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.American Express is expected to post earnings of $2.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.50 indicates a change of +12.3% from what American Express is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for American Express.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of American Express, the consensus sales estimate of $15.43 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.8%. The $60.81 billion and $66.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15% and +9.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmerican Express reported revenues of $15.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.89 for the same period compares with $2.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.34%. The EPS surprise was +3.21%.Over the last four quarters, American Express surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.American Express is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about American Express. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 4/104. GF Value rank: 5/105. Momentum rank: 5/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned NiSource Inc the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding NiSource Inc's BusinessNiSource Inc, with a market cap of $11.002 billion, is one of the nation's largest natural gas distribution companies, serving approximately 3.2 million customers in Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The company's electric utility transmits and distributes electricity in northern Indiana to about 500,000 customers. The regulated electric utility also owns more than 3,000 megawatts of generation capacity, most of which is now coal-fired but is being replaced by natural gas and renewable energy. With sales of $5.850 billion and an operating margin of 20.9%, NiSource Inc's business model is robust yet faces potential challenges.Story continuesUnraveling the Future of NiSource Inc (NI): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsFinancial Strength BreakdownNiSource Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.97 positions it worse than 60.8% of 426 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.54, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 5.97, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 71.33% of 436 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where NiSource Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -1.6 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 86.25% of 480 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Lastly, NiSource Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Future of NiSource Inc (NI): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights NiSource Inc's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While the company has a robust business model and a significant market presence, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's 5 Activist Targets.Nelson Peltz is a popular name when it comes to activism on Wall Street. The billionaire investor has made a name for himself by serving several boards and pushing for drastic changes to unlock shareholder value. He helped cofound Trian Partners, a hedge fund focused on investing in high-quality but highly undervalued and underperforming public companies.Although Peltz is consistently open to cooperative efforts with management teams and boards to unlock value, he is not hesitant to initiate proxy battles when necessary. An average return of 38.12% since 2013 underscores why he is a revered activist investor on Wall Street.At the height of the bear run in 2022, Trian Partners was down by 10.6%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which ended the year down 19%. Trian's performance was much better, considering on average hedge funds lost 17.2% in 2022.As an activist investor, Peltz often lobbies for changes within companies he is engaged in proxy battles. For starters, he may push for higher dividends, share buybacks, cost cuts, and management changes. He may sometimes push for company dissolution or the sale of some units. After acquiring a $1.3 billion stake in PepsiCo Company in 2013, he called the CEO and demanded the company acquire Mondelez International, a company in which he owned $1 billion in stakes.After acquiring a 9.9% stake in asset manager Invesco and Janus Henderson in 2020, the activist investor pushed for a merger for the two companies. While the deal never materialized, he succeeded in turning Invesco's fortune around, with its operating margins and earnings more than doubling. While Janus did underperform, Peltz continued to ramp up stakes, becoming its largest shareholder after that.Story continuesIn the most recent past, Peltz has waged a proxy battle with Disney after formally launching a bid for a board seat. The activist investor insists he wants to rescue the company from what he calls a crisis of overspending on the streaming business, the purchase of 21st Century Fox, and failed succession planning. Peltz's latest onslaught is seen as a serious challenge to Bob Iger, one of the most famous executives who returned from retirement to lead the company for a second time.Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist TargetsNelson Peltz of Trian PartnersOur methodologyPeltz's activist campaigns have generated an average of 9.6% over the past 15 years. While some campaigns have been extremely successful, generating returns of more than 30%, some have been a disappointment, losing as much as 15%, as was the case with General Electric.We have compiled a list of some of the top activist campaigns engineered by the billionaire investor since founding Trian Partners in 2005. The campaigns are ranked chronologically based on when they occurred.Long-Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist Targets12. Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL)Activist Investment: 2022 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: 11.87% S&amp;P 500 Gain: 8.63%Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) is a consumer goods company that operates through beauty and well-being, Personal Care Nutrition, and Ice Cream Segments. The company also deals in hair care products such as shampoo, conditioner, and styling.Peltz started building a position in the British Consumer goods company in 2022. The activist investor has since pushed for management changes, having approached former CEOs of consumer goods companies to take up the top job at the Dove soap maker. He has also committed to helping drive Unilever's strategy operations sustainability and shareholder value.11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Activist Investment: 2022 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: -16.98% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 17.33%A conglomerate in the entertainment industry, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is best known for its leading role in creating and providing entertainment and information. The company also operates some of the biggest theme parks. The company saw a slew of activist investor activity in 2022, led by Peltz and Daniel Loeb.Peltz increased his stake in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in early 2023 in an attempt to gain sizable influence on the company's future roadmap. With his hedge fund Trian Partners, the activist investor was forced to end a proxy battle in February after Disney agreed to restructure its business and launch an effort to reduce costs by about $5.5 billion.With the changes, Peltz ended his quest for a board seat after CEO Iger laid out plans for cutting 7,000 jobs as part of the cost-cutting measures. The CEO has also agreed to consider the sale of the company's linear networks like ABC Freeform and National Geographic.10. Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ)Activist Investment: 2020 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: 142% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 45.38%Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) is an independent asset investment management company that provides a range of investment capabilities and outcomes to help clients achieve various objectives.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

355,be3366ea-24ac-39ee-a4de-cbfa0a364e59,OXY,2023-09-08,An Intrinsic Calculation For Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Suggests It's 32% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-occidental-petroleum-corporation-120022273.html,1694174422,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsOccidental Petroleum's estimated fair value is US$94.34 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityOccidental Petroleum's US$64.57 share price signals that it might be 32% undervalued The US$68.20 analyst price target for OXY is 28% less than our estimate of fair valueHow far off is Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.00bUS$5.57bUS$5.92bUS$6.22bUS$6.33bUS$6.45bUS$6.58bUS$6.72bUS$6.86bUS$7.00bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 1.84%Est @ 1.94%Est @ 2.00%Est @ 2.04%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.10% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.1% US$5.5kUS$4.7kUS$4.6kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.1kUS$2.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$40bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.1%– 2.2%) = US$103bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$103b÷ ( 1 + 9.1%)10= US$43bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$83b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$64.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.384. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy.

Accelerating digital investments also bodes well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST and Keurig Dr Pepper KDP are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.What's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Soft drink companies have been gaining from improved demand trends, aiding volume growth. Due to recovery across markets, market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels have been boosting sales. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly lifted sales in recent quarters. The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher sales and operating expenses costs, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

368,1022faf6-0efa-30e4-92d6-0f91fe38989e,WM,2023-09-08,7 Cash Cow Stocks for Recession-Resilient Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cash-cow-stocks-recession-165141139.html,1693587101,STORY,"['AFL', 'VZ', 'KOF', 'BRK-B', 'O', 'JNJ', 'WM']","[The rally we’ve seen in previous weeks has given investors a breath of fresh air, but I believe volatility is likely to persist over the next few months. With the Federal Reserve committed to further rate hikes, turbulence could easily return to the markets later this year. While I don’t foresee an imminent recession, taking some risk off the table seems prudent. Many big tech names have seen stellar gains over the past decade but now look vulnerable to plateauing or even pulling back if recessionary winds start blowing.With that in mind, taking profits from overvalued big tech stocks and redeploying that capital into more stable dividend payers or more under-appreciated growth stocks is a decent idea. I’ll be focusing on the former.Although these stocks may not capture headlines like the tech darlings do, their steady payouts and defensive business models make them appealing options during uncertain times. By favoring these dividend stocks over inflated big tech names, you can generate safe and consistent income while waiting for lower valuations for higher-growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is in the business of providing supplemental insurance products. This business is generally boring, but continues to deliver steady growth, even in turbulent markets. The company posted a strong second quarter, beating earnings estimates by 14 cents per share. A key growth driver has been Aflac’s cancer insurance sales, which were up 60% in Q2 versus a year ago. The launch of Aflac’s new WINGS cancer product in the Japan Post channel in April also provided a significant boost to the company’s growth.While economic uncertainty persists, Aflac’s supplemental insurance products remain attractive to consumers looking to protect themselves financially. The company expects to sustain momentum with the upcoming launch of a new medical product in September. Though some analysts have expressed concerns about Aflac’s exposure to currency fluctuations, the company has taken steps to reduce this risk. Given its leading market share, sticky customer base, and prudent financial management, Aflac seems poised to continue generating predictable earnings and dividends for income investors.Story continuesNotably, AFL stock provides investors with a forward dividend yield of 2.25%, rising for four decades straight.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continues delivering strong fundamental performance, posting Q2 results that beat earnings expectations by 18 cents per share. The healthcare giant’s sales grew 6.3%, demonstrating the strength of J&amp;J’s diversified business model spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health.Key pharmaceutical growth drivers included the company’s oncology portfolio and new product launches like CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI for multiple myeloma treatment. J&amp;J’s pipeline progress also looks promising, with upcoming catalysts across its key future assets. Meanwhile, the company’s MedTech segment grew 15% operationally, aided by the recent Abiomed acquisition.As a sweetener, Johnson &amp; Johnson offers a forward dividend yield of 2.9%, as well as an impressive history of 62 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Analysts believe year-end growth will come in around the 5.5% level, along with 6% earnings per share growth.Waste Management (WM)Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comThough Waste Management (NYSE:WM) faced some revenue headwinds in Q2 from lower commodity prices, the company continues generating shareholder value through its pricing power, cost discipline, and a steady dividend. Waste collection is a resilient business, providing essential services even during economic downturns.Waste Management boosted its adjusted operating EBITDA margin by 60 basis points in Q2 via diligent cost control and SG&amp;A optimization. While management modestly reduced full-year revenue guidance due to commodity pricing pressures, the company still expects to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.7% at the midpoint for 2023.Looking ahead, the company’s management team aims to expand EBITDA margins by capturing synergies from technology investments and leaning into price increases to offset inflationary pressures. With its wide economic moat and earnings per share growth projected to come in around 6-7% in 2023, WM stock offers an attractive blend of defensiveness, income and growth. It currently yields a modest 1.8%, but its distribution have increased for two decades straight.Realty Income (O)hand of person in a suit dangling keys with a house symbol on the ring. Windows overlooking city skyline in background.Source: ImageFlow/shutterstock.comDespite headwinds from higher interest rates, Realty Income (NYSE:O) continues generating steady growth driven by its high-quality real estate portfolio. The company has maintained an impressive 99% occupancy rate over the past three quarters, demonstrating the durability of its properties and tenant relationships. Management expects investments to exceed $7 billion in 2023, with the company leveraging its scale and relationships to source accretive deals even in today’s capital-constrained environment.While some investors fear a pullback in commercial real estate, Realty Income’s focus on service-oriented and low price point industries should provide resilience. Currently, O stock offers an attractive 5.4% dividend yield, with investors paying only 13.6-times forward funds from operations, with a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. It’s a bargain when you consider that the average analyst believes Realty Income will post 16.5% year-over-year sales growth this year and 11% next year. Some bulls believe the real estate giant’s revenue growth could come in as high as 30% by the end of 2026. Plus, even the lowest recent price target on Wall Street is $5 higher than its current price.Verizon (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) has faced endless headwinds lately, with its stock price down nearly 20% over the past year amid concerns about subscriber losses, lead concerns and competitive pressures. Verizon did deliver a Q2 earnings beat, but it missed revenue estimates. Still, various metrics show momentum in key growth areas like fixed wireless access. Verizon added 384,000 fixed wireless subscribers in Q2, surpassing 2.3 million total, and on pace to hit its target of 4-5 million subscribers by 2025.The company’s 5G network expansions are also paying off, with improved customer retention and higher average revenue per user. Looking ahead, Verizon expects to continue improving its 5G coverage and performance as more C-band spectrum comes online. With the stock now trading at just 7-times forward earnings, Verizon looks very undervalued considering its strong wireless network, 5G progress, and growth potential in fixed wireless broadband. For investors seeking an underappreciated telecom giant with a rock-solid dividend, Verizon checks all the boxes. The forward dividend yield with VZ stock is 7.5%, but that’s unlikely to remain stable due to price volatility.Coca-Cola Femsa (KOF)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola Femsa (NYSE:KOF) has quietly delivered impressive growth, with Q2 revenues up 30.2%. This Coke bottling partner serves over 270 million consumers across Latin America and saw 7% volume growth in Q2, driven by Mexico, Brazil, and Guatemala.Coca-Cola Femsa is leveraging brand strength, product innovations like low-sugar drinks, and improved distribution to gain share in growing markets. Its omnichannel Juntos+ B2B platform now accounts for 30% of revenues in its traditional trade channel. With shares trading at 17-times forward earnings and also providing a 3.7% dividend yield, Coca-Cola Femsa offers stability with untapped growth potential thanks to its leading position in an expanding region.Analysts expect sales growth to be nearly 17.5% for all of 2023. Sales would match its current market cap in roughly 4 years, which makes KOF stock very appealing, even after its recent appreciation.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comLed by the legendary Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) remains a core holding for many long-term investors, even if the stock isn’t cheap. Berkshire’s diversified business mix provides earnings power and stability across market cycles. Operating earnings grew 6.6% in Q2, aided by higher insurance investment income, though several units faced challenges like BNSF Rail and Berkshire’s housing-related businesses. Berkshire’s insurance float hit $166 billion, providing ample capital to deploy. With over $147 billion in cash, Berkshire can capitalize on market dislocations when times get tough. Thus, this is a stock to hold for the very long-term, for most investors.Sure, it’s expensive right now, but the stock’s premium valuation is justified by the unmatched track record of Buffett and his team. For investors willing to pay up to gain exposure to his disciplines and investment acumen, Berkshire Hathaway belongs in any high-quality, long-term portfolio. Unfortunately, it does not pay out dividends directly, but holds many stocks that do.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Intuit is the latest to join the fray. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi (INTU) joined Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi to talk about how Intuit is incorporating AI into its businesses. The company is launching ""Intuit Assist,"" a generative AI assistant. Goodarzi provides one example of how the product will work, saying small businesses could use it to help build and execute an entire marketing campaign for new products. Goodarzi says that “based on all the data that we have access to, all the investments we have made over the years, the last decade in AI, we are able to tip the odds in favor of those that need it most."" When it comes to which part of his company will feel the impact of AI, Goodarzi says it's ""all of them,"" adding that the ""notion of delivering personalized intelligence experiences is really important"" to all of his businesses.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Another key player that we follow very closely at Yahoo Finance as it pertains to the economy, small businesses, and AI, that's Intuit. And joining me now is Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi. Sasan, always great to get some time with you. Miss you here at this Goldman Sachs conference, but I know you have a lot of big AI initiatives and AI news hitting the tape here from your company today.Take us through exactly what you are announcing. My interpretation of it was you're layering in new forms of AI across your various platforms, TurboTax, Credit Karma, Mailchimp, you name it.SASAN GOODARZI: Well, Brian, first of all, great to see you. I missed you at Goldman Sachs. But I know our CFO was there. So listen, yesterday was an enormous day for Intuit. At our Intuit Innovation Day, we launched Intuit Assist. And Intuit Assist is really a personalized intelligent assistant in your pocket. It's also powered by AI driven human experts so that when you are getting assistance from Intuit Assist, if you ever need to talk to an expert no matter what it is that you're doing, you're able to do that. So there's always a gateway to help. That was the big news yesterday.Story continuesIf I were to double click a few examples of what we launched for small businesses, now you have the ability to be able to grow your business, and we work with you to develop a marketing campaign. For instance, if you just came out with a new product, let's just say it's a modern furniture, we work with you to help you create an entire campaign, you know, what kind of images, what kind of content, who do you want to target. You are always in control of being able to adjust the campaign itself, but we develop it all for you.And then once you confirm the campaign, we execute it for you and then help you with what the results are, what your cash flow is from that campaign, and what the next steps are. Almost like you're sitting across the table from your marketing team. And really the intent is based on all the data that we have access to, all of the investments we've made over the years, the last decade in AI. We're able to tip the odds in the favor of those that need it most. So it was a really exciting day yesterday. And we can't wait to launch all of these capabilities over time to our customers.BRIAN SOZZI: Out of all the very large businesses that you operated into it, Sasan, which business will AI play the biggest role moving forward?SASAN GOODARZI: You know, Brian, it's all of them because if you just sort of step back and think about the problem spaces that we focus on, consumers are trying to make ends meet. They're trying to get out of debt. They're trying to save money. They're trying to make more of the money that they have. And small businesses, their biggest focus area is how do I grow my customers, how do I retain them, how do I grow revenues, and how do I manage my cash flow.So across our platform, Credit Karma, TurboTax, and across our small business platform, which is Mailchimp and QuickBooks, this notion of delivering personalized intelligent experiences is really important. So I'll just use another example for you, which is Credit Karma and TurboTax.Ultimately, we're trying to help you make ends meet. And so if you are in a situation where you have a big unexpected cost-- your car breaks down and you have to have a large expense-- we detect that on the platform. We will send you a notification that says we can see that you've had a big expense. You have a cash flow issue. Here are several ways in which we would suggest that you can address your cash flow issue.We can give you early access to your wages. You can take out a personal loan at the lowest rate that's already been pre-approved for you to ultimately get you back up and running. And that's-- think about the power of having an assistant in your pocket that is by your side every step of the way as a consumer or a small business to help power your prosperity.So really all of our investments over the years in data and AI, it's why it's been core to our declaration 5 plus years ago, has really been to create a future where it's done for you. You're always in control. But it's done for you. And it applies to every part of our platform across consumers and small businesses, which I think is what makes this era of data and AI and particularly gen AI so exciting because I think it will ignite global innovation and create new economies.BRIAN SOZZI: Sasan, we see in the market action right now lots of continued fear about rising interest rates and what it means to consumers' households not just today, but of course in 2024. You offer-- your company offers a real great snapshot into some of those trends via Credit Karma and some other businesses, but notably Credit Karma. How strained are small businesses and that Gen Z consumer right now?SASAN GOODARZI: Yeah, well, first of all, just for your viewers, we have over 100 million customers across our platform, across all of our platforms. So there is a lot that we see. I'll start with small businesses. Small businesses across the platform, their cash reserves are about 90% of what they were this time last year.Now although it's down, it's actually significantly better and more improved than it was prior to the pandemic. So although they are being impacted by the current environment, they are actually in better shape than they were several years ago. On the consumer side, we see a couple of things. One, since March of last year, credit scores are down 13 points. Generally credit card balances are up over 30%. And particularly with Gen Z, since you asked about them, they're actually-- their credit card balances are up over 45%.But many consumers have jobs. And so although they are being impacted by the current environment, they have jobs, but they're being strained in terms of being very intentional about where they're spending the money. And those are some of the stats that I think demonstrates jobs at the same time strained by the current environment.BRIAN SOZZI: Mental note to everyone watching this. Cash is still king. Use cash. Don't have to put on your credit card sometimes. We'll leave it there. Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, good luck with the AI journey. We'll talk to you soon. We appreciate you coming on like always.SASAN GOODARZI: Thanks for having me, Brian. Take care.]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230907304483/en/Most marketers think they have a Customer problem. In reality, they have a Clustomer problem. (Photo: Business Wire)""We are in a unique position to be a marketing company marketing to marketers. So when research revealed that our advanced marketing customer's biggest pain point was figuring out better ways to personalize at scale to make the most out of their web of customers, we instantly wanted to visualize that problem in a fun and simple way that marketers could identify with. And thus, the Clustomer idea was born. A tangled mess of customers with different behaviors that have all been grouped together as one audience,"" says Jeremy Jones, Group Creative Director, Intuit Mailchimp. ""At Wink, we think it's our best, most distinct campaign yet, and we couldn’t be more excited for the world to see it.""So, What’s a Clustomer Anyway?Most marketers think they have a Customer problem. In reality, they have a Clustomer problem.When marketers fail to segment targets and personalize their messaging to the fullest extent, the result is CLUSTOMERS. Amorphous blobs of undifferentiated customers that all receive the same marketing message. Yuck.The good news is Mailchimp has advanced marketing capabilities to help release marketers from the Clustomer (and see up to 141% more revenue with AI-built predicted segments2). To help them along the journey, we also recently announced a new generative AI assistant called Intuit Assist, a marketing strategist that will help you draft emails and help save you time.Story continuesAlso this year, we released over 150 new and updated features, like advanced segmentation, custom reporting, more e-commerce automations and customer journeys, and enhanced support options to help marketers spend less time creating emails and reports, accelerate their e-commerce growth, and reach their customers with truly targeted marketing.These tools help unlock ‘personalization at scale’ so that marketers can see their customers and potential customers' individual needs more clearly: Some need to be reunited with their abandoned shopping carts, some need to be converted, some are ripe for cross-selling. Mailchimp’s advanced personalization tools use real-time behavioral data and automated triggers to take a Clustomer, break it into like-minded targets, then send them personalized marketing.Mailchimp customers can tap into their customer data for more personalization than ever before, allowing them to:Get up to 7x more orders with automated journeys3Use 50+ behavior-based triggers for advanced personalizationSegment with advanced AI tools for up to 141% more revenue2Bringing the Clustomer to LifeThe campaign, targeting advanced marketers around the globe, aims to build a whimsical and ethereal world built off the emotions marketers feel when moving through different phases of the classic marketing funnel.For example, when marketers are in the early stages of attracting prospective customers and making them aware of a particular product or service they can often feel disordered, confined, and confused. That’s visually represented by the campaign’s hero image of the Clustomer ball.As marketers begin to build awareness and consideration for purchasing among their target audience the campaign transitions into visuals that evoke feelings like: freeing, graceful, and ethereal.Finally, when marketers reach the coveted stage of converting prospective customers into paid ones, untangling the complex web of their Clustomer problem, the visuals begin to feel more grounded, balanced, and clean. This represents the power and orderliness brought about by Mailchimp’s AI-backed marketing and automation tools.For media kit and visuals, please reach out to pr@mailchimp.com.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230907020022/en/Most marketers think they have a Customer problem. In reality, they have a Clustomer problem. (Photo: Business Wire)""We are in a unique position to be a marketing company marketing to marketers. So when research revealed that our advanced marketing customers’ biggest pain point was figuring out better ways to personalize at scale to make the most out of their web of customers, we instantly wanted to visualize that problem in a fun and simple way that marketers could identify with. And thus, the Clustomer idea was born. A tangled mess of customers with different behaviors that have all been grouped together as one audience,"" says Jeremy Jones, Group Creative Director, Intuit Mailchimp. ""At Wink, we think it's our best, most distinct campaign yet, and we couldn’t be more excited for the world to see it.""So, What’s a Clustomer Anyway?Most marketers think they have a Customer problem. In reality, they have a Clustomer problem.When marketers fail to segment targets and personalize their messaging to the fullest extent, the result is CLUSTOMERS. Amorphous blobs of undifferentiated customers that all receive the same marketing message. Yuck.The good news is Mailchimp has advanced marketing capabilities to help release marketers from the Clustomer (and see up to 141% more revenue with AI-built predicted segments2). To help them along the journey, we also recently announced a new generative AI assistant called Intuit Assist, a marketing strategist that will help you draft emails and help save you time.Story continuesAlso this year, we released over 150 new and updated features, like advanced segmentation, custom reporting, more e-commerce automations and customer journeys, SMS marketing, and enhanced support options to help marketers spend less time creating emails and reports, accelerate their e-commerce growth, and reach their customers with truly targeted marketing.These tools help unlock ‘personalization at scale’ so that marketers can see their customers and potential customers' individual needs more clearly: Some need to be reunited with their abandoned shopping carts, some need to be converted, some are ripe for cross-selling. Mailchimp’s advanced personalization tools use real-time behavioral data and automated triggers to take a Clustomer, break it into like-minded targets, then send them personalized marketing.Mailchimp customers can tap into their customer data for more personalization than ever before, allowing them to:Get up to 7x more orders with automated journeys3Use 50+ behavior-based triggers for advanced personalizationSegment with advanced AI tools for up to 141% more revenue2Bringing the Clustomer to LifeThe campaign, targeting advanced marketers around the globe, aims to build a whimsical and ethereal world built off the emotions marketers feel when moving through different phases of the classic marketing funnel.For example, when marketers are in the early stages of attracting prospective customers and making them aware of a particular product or service they can often feel disordered, confined, and confused. That’s visually represented by the campaign’s hero image of the Clustomer ball.As marketers begin to build awareness and consideration for purchasing among their target audience the campaign transitions into visuals that evoke feelings like: freeing, graceful, and ethereal.Finally, when marketers reach the coveted stage of converting prospective customers into paid ones, untangling the complex web of their Clustomer problem, the visuals begin to feel more grounded, balanced, and clean. This represents the power and orderliness brought about by Mailchimp’s AI-backed marketing and automation tools.For media kit and visuals, please reach out to pr@mailchimp.com.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Both Haemonetics and Stryker have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HAE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.25, while SYK has a forward P/E of 27.88.

Shares have lost about 11.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Perrigo due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Beats Q2 Earnings &amp; Sales EstimatesPerrigo reported adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share in second-quarter 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Earnings were up 46.5% year over year. The upside can be attributed to favorable discrete tax benefits from the resolution of various tax matters and lower operating expenses incurred by the company during the quarter.Net sales increased 6.4% year over year to $1.19 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 billion. Excluding the negative currency impact, sales rose 6.6%. The upside was driven by strategic pricing actions undertaken by management during the quarter, sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma and the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian Good Start infant formula brand. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 0.8% year over year.Segment DiscussionCSCA: The segment’s net sales in the second quarter of 2023 came in at $750.8 million, up 3.1% year over year, driven by acquisitions and strategic price increases. However, this upside was partially offset by purposeful SKU prioritization actions to enhance margins as part of the company's Supply Chain Reinvention Program undertaken last year.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $442.4 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago period’s levels. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 12.8% year over year. Organically, sales increased 7.1%. Segment revenues benefited from higher sales of HRA Pharma brands and strategic pricing actions. An unfavorable currency movement negatively impacted sales.Story continues2023 GuidancePerrigo reiterated its financial guidance for 2023. Management expects to report net sales growth in the range of 7-11%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $2.50 and $2.70. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be around 17%, while the company expects to record interest expenses of about $180 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -9.15% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Perrigo has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Perrigo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerPerrigo is part of the Zacks Medical - Products industry. Over the past month, Stryker (SYK), a stock from the same industry, has gained 2.5%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.Stryker reported revenues of $5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.2%. EPS of $2.54 for the same period compares with $2.25 a year ago.Stryker is expected to post earnings of $2.44 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.1%.

ALGN recently introduced a new SmartForce feature, attachment-free aligner activation. The new SmartForce attachment-free aligner activation feature, which builds on Align Technology’s foundational biomechanics for clear aligners and its database of Invisalign patients, is expected to aid in minimizing the number of attachments while maintaining predictable treatment outcomes.The new SmartForce attachment-free aligner activation feature is the latest of Align Technology’s many biomechanical innovations that enhance experiences for patients in Invisalign treatment.The attachment-free aligner activation feature is built into the Align Digital Platform and is the newest innovation as part of the Align digital workflow. A related update to ClinCheck treatment planning will include Live Update for 3D Controls that includes an attachment-free aligner activation selection.The introduction of the latest feature is expected to significantly boost Align Technology’s Invisalign sales across the globe.Significance of the FeatureThe SmartForce features, which include optimized attachments that are small tooth-colored shapes attached to teeth, are designed to deliver precise forces when and where needed to achieve more predictable tooth movements. Double attachments are often needed on upper central (front) teeth to achieve desired mesiodistal root movements.Although optimized attachments are critical for successful Invisalign treatment, with this new release, certain movements are now likely to be achieved using a similar force system via aligner activation. This is expected to reduce the need for double attachments on the centrals. If an attachment is still needed for certain scenarios, aligner activation will be present with a single optimized root control attachment as with other teeth, such as canines and premolars.Per management, via the innovation, Align Technology is expected to address the needs of doctors and their patients without compromising Invisalign treatment outcomes. Management also added that in cases where attachments are still necessary to ensure the optimal force systems, a single optimized root control attachment with SmartForce aligner activation has been designed to achieve the same movement instead of the more visible double attachment.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global clear aligners market was valued at $3.8 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $32.4 billion by 2031 at a CAGR of 24%. Factors like the increase in the trend of cosmetic dentistry, the rising number of people going for dental aesthetics and the prevalence of malocclusion are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the introduction of the latest feature is likely to significantly solidify Align Technology’s foothold in the niche space.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Align Technology introduced the Invisalign Palatal Expander System, a modern and innovative direct 3D printed device based on a proprietary and patented technology.The same month, Align Technology introduced Plan Editor in ClinCheck treatment planning software, a new tool in the Align digital workflow built into the Align Digital Platform.Also, in September, Align Technology entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately-held Cubicure GmbH. Per management, the acquisition of Cubicure will strengthen Align Technology’s existing intellectual property portfolio and know-how in direct 3D printing of appliances. Integration with Cubicure will also extend and scale Align Technology’s printing, materials and manufacturing capabilities for its 3D-printed product portfolio.Price PerformanceShares of Align Technology have gained 43.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 7.8% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 11.6% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Align Technology carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The new platform is infused with beneficial features, such as dynamic discounting, early payment and price discovery, which may offer an opportunity to enterprises and vendors to boost their cash flows and gain greater access to working capital.Meanwhile, the payments solution will serve the purpose of a complete procure-to-pay offering for businesses, which, in turn, is expected to impart more efficiency in invoice matching and processing. In view of a rapidly growing digital economy, small businesses may often find it difficult to adopt digital means due to the dearth of finances and resources.Consequently, the new platform may also prove to be a blessing in disguise for small vendors and save a substantial portion of their expenses, which would have been exhausted in technology upgradation. It will enable such businesses to seamlessly receive payments without the need of in-house payment gateways and point-of-sale machines.The latest partnership reflects Mastercard’s sincere efforts to roll out cutting-edge solutions and streamline digital payments acceptance by businesses of all sizes.  Such moves also highlight MA’s endeavor to bolster its B2B products and services portfolio as well as widen its customer base.Simultaneously, the tech giant collaborated with KredX to remove the frequent hurdles, which crop up while making B2B payments, with a particular focus on easing the card-enabled ones. Mastercard’s efforts to modernize the evolving B2B payments landscape with the new platform is a dire need as a number of intricacies related to time-consuming accounting and reconciliation processes, low vendor acceptance, frequent chargeback and currency variations continue to linger across the market.Story continuesApart from launching solutions, Mastercard has been partnering with several organizations to benefit the worldwide B2B payments space.

Shares have lost about 3.1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Jacobs Solutions due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Jacobs’ Earnings Miss Estimates in Q3, Backlog IncreasesJacobs reported mixed results for third-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023), with earnings missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassing the same.Earnings declined year over year, but revenues increased on the back of solid performance across the portfolio. It also reported a near-record backlog thanks to a robust opportunity set, led by People and Places Solutions’ operating profit growth of 13% year-over-year.On May 9, the company announced its intent to separate the Critical Mission Solutions (“CMS”) business. This marks one of its strategic portfolio transformation initiatives to create a higher-growth and higher-margin business portfolio focused on critical infrastructure and sustainability. Jacobs expects to complete the transaction in the second half of fiscal 2024.Inside the HeadlinesFor the reported quarter, adjusted earnings of $1.82 per share lagged the consensus estimate of $1.84 by 1.1%. Also, the reported figure was down 2.2% from the year-ago period due to benefits received from a cost-method investment sold in the previous year.Jacobs’ revenues totaled $4.19 billion, which topped the consensus mark of $4.05 billion by 3.4% and grew 9.4% year over year. Net revenues were up 7.5% year over year on an adjusted basis and up 8% in constant currency.Adjusted operating profit grew 10.2% to $361 million from a year ago. The adjusted operating margin of 10.7% expanded by 27 basis points (bps).Adjusted EBITDA fell 2.1% and adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 100 bps year over year.The backlog at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023 amounted to $28.9 billion, up 3% from a year ago.Story continuesSegment DetailsRevenues from the CMS segment of $1.19 billion increased 7.4% year over year. The segment’s operating profit of $99 million was up 12.2% from $88 million reported a year ago, with a margin expansion of 36 bps to 8.3%. The backlog at the fiscal third-quarter end was $8.097 billion, up from $7.22 billion a year ago.Revenues from the People &amp; Places Solutions or P&amp;PS segment totaled $2.47 billion, which increased 11.1% year over year. Net revenues (excluding Pass-Through Revenue) were up 8.9% year over year. Segment operating profit grew 13.4% from the prior-year quarter to $243 million and the margin rose 58 bps to 14.4%. The backlog at the quarter’s end was $17.5 billion, marginally down from $17.53 billion a year ago.Revenues from the Divergent Solutions segment totaled $239.3 million, which grew 9.8% year over year. Divergent Solutions’ net revenues were up 3% year over year. Segment operating profit improved 72% from the prior-year quarter to $21 million. Operating margin of 9.5% also grew 384 bps year over year. The backlog at the quarter’s end was $2.965 billion, down from $3.02 billion a year ago.PA Consulting generated $286.9 million in revenues in the quarter, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $277.6 million. Segment operating profit was $61 million, up 18.3% from $51 million a year ago. Segment operating improved by 268 bps to 21.2%. The quarter-end backlog amounted to $355 million, up from $326 million a year ago.Balance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAt the fiscal third-quarter end, Jacobs had cash and cash equivalents of $1,092.1 million, down from $1,140.5 million at the end of fiscal 2022 (Sep 30, 2022). Long-term debt decreased to $3.15 billion at the fiscal third-quarter end from $3.36 billion at the fiscal 2022-end.Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $321.1 million in the quarter versus net cash used in operating activities of $249.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Fiscal 2023 Guidance ReiteratedJacobs expects adjusted EBITDA between $1,420 million and $1,470 million and adjusted earnings within $7.25-$7.45 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings is currently pegged at $7.35 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.VGM ScoresAt this time, Jacobs Solutions has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Jacobs Solutions has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerJacobs Solutions is part of the Zacks Technology Services industry. Over the past month, Trane Technologies (TT), a stock from the same industry, has gained 1.1%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.Trane Technologies reported revenues of $4.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.16 a year ago.Trane Technologies is expected to post earnings of $2.65 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.7%.

IR is well-poised for growth, courtesy of the company’s solid product portfolio, innovation capabilities and focus on boosting its aftermarket businesses.Let’s delve into the factors, which make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company a smart investment choice at the moment.Business Strength: Ingersoll Rand’s Industrial Technologies &amp; Services segment is benefiting from solid demand. The company continues to see higher orders across its product portfolio of compressors, vacuum and blowers, and power tools and lifting within the Industrial Technologies &amp; Services unit.Pricing actions and acquired assets are boosting revenues in the Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment. Also, exposure to various end markets, including industrial manufacturing, mining &amp; construction, energy, transportation, medical and laboratory sciences, food and beverage packaging as well as chemical processing, should help Ingersoll Rand offset weaknesses associated with a single market.Expansion Efforts: IR has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. The company acquired SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business in January 2023. The buyout boosted IR’s core compressor product offering through a complementary product portfolio of energy-efficient compressed air dryers, filters and other consumables. The Air Treatment business is currently a part of IR’s Industrial Technologies and Services segment.The acquisition of Dosatron International (October 2022) expanded Ingersoll Rand’s digital technology portfolio, opening up opportunities in hydroponics, horticulture, animal health, food safety and sanitation along with water treatment end markets, where Dosatron had a strong presence. Dosatron is now a part of Ingersoll Rand’s Precision and Science Technologies segment. In second-quarter 2023, acquisitions contributed 5.9% to Ingersoll Rand’s total revenues. For 2023, the company anticipates mergers/acquisitions to contribute $300 million to total revenues.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first six months of 2023, the company paid out dividends of $16.2 million and repurchased shares worth $132.8 million.Northbound Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IR’s 2023 earnings has been revised 2.2% upward.Price Performance: Shares of the company have gained 42% in the past year compared with the industry’s 16.3% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Caterpillar Inc.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy How Fast Is Valero Energy Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Valero Energy has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. In impressive fashion, Valero Energy's EPS grew from US$17.34 to US$30.87, over the previous 12 months. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 78%.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While revenue is looking a bit flat, the good news is EBIT margins improved by 3.2 percentage points to 9.9%, in the last twelve months. That's something to smile about.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Valero Energy.Are Valero Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Valero Energy, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$225m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.5% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Valero Energy, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$12m.Valero Energy offered total compensation worth US$8.4m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.Does Valero Energy Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Valero Energy's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. The sweetener is that insiders have a mountain of stock, and the CEO remuneration is quite reasonable. The drastic earnings growth indicates the business is going from strength to strength. Hopefully a trend that continues well into the future. Big growth can make big winners, so the writing on the wall tells us that Valero Energy is worth considering carefully. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Valero Energy that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

(NYSE:EL) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Estée Lauder Companies Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Group President, Jane Hudis, sold US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$202 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$157.

According to The ADP ADP National Employment Report, private payrolls increased by 177,000 in August, sharply lower than the July figures of 371,000.This came a day after the JOLTS report showed that job openings fell to 8.8 million in July, lower than the consensus estimate of 9.5 million.Additionally, the Labor Department said that the unemployment level jumped to 3.8% month over month in July, sharply higher than the rate of 3.5% in June.Understandably, the labor market is finally cooling. The Fed’s monetary tightening campaign is finally bearing fruit. Inflation has sharply declined from its peak of 9.1% in June 2021. The Fed has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25%-5.5%.The signs of a softening economy have once again raised hopes that the Fed might pause its interest rate hikes soon. This bodes well for growth assets like tech companies, which are poised to gain from lower borrowing costs.This is because higher interest rates can create challenges for tech companies by constraining their future cash flow, which in turn affects their capacity to invest in innovation and limits their potential for growth.Story continuesWhen interest rates increase, it becomes more costly for tech firms to borrow money, resulting in higher cash outflows and increased financial difficulties.3 Best ChoicesWe have selected three mutual funds with significant exposure to the tech sector.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's 5 Activist Targets.Nelson Peltz is a popular name when it comes to activism on Wall Street. The billionaire investor has made a name for himself by serving several boards and pushing for drastic changes to unlock shareholder value. He helped cofound Trian Partners, a hedge fund focused on investing in high-quality but highly undervalued and underperforming public companies.Although Peltz is consistently open to cooperative efforts with management teams and boards to unlock value, he is not hesitant to initiate proxy battles when necessary. An average return of 38.12% since 2013 underscores why he is a revered activist investor on Wall Street.At the height of the bear run in 2022, Trian Partners was down by 10.6%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which ended the year down 19%. Trian's performance was much better, considering on average hedge funds lost 17.2% in 2022.As an activist investor, Peltz often lobbies for changes within companies he is engaged in proxy battles. For starters, he may push for higher dividends, share buybacks, cost cuts, and management changes. He may sometimes push for company dissolution or the sale of some units. After acquiring a $1.3 billion stake in PepsiCo Company in 2013, he called the CEO and demanded the company acquire Mondelez International, a company in which he owned $1 billion in stakes.After acquiring a 9.9% stake in asset manager Invesco and Janus Henderson in 2020, the activist investor pushed for a merger for the two companies. While the deal never materialized, he succeeded in turning Invesco's fortune around, with its operating margins and earnings more than doubling. While Janus did underperform, Peltz continued to ramp up stakes, becoming its largest shareholder after that.Story continuesIn the most recent past, Peltz has waged a proxy battle with Disney after formally launching a bid for a board seat. The activist investor insists he wants to rescue the company from what he calls a crisis of overspending on the streaming business, the purchase of 21st Century Fox, and failed succession planning. Peltz's latest onslaught is seen as a serious challenge to Bob Iger, one of the most famous executives who returned from retirement to lead the company for a second time.Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist TargetsNelson Peltz of Trian PartnersOur methodologyPeltz's activist campaigns have generated an average of 9.6% over the past 15 years. While some campaigns have been extremely successful, generating returns of more than 30%, some have been a disappointment, losing as much as 15%, as was the case with General Electric.We have compiled a list of some of the top activist campaigns engineered by the billionaire investor since founding Trian Partners in 2005.

With his hedge fund Trian Partners, the activist investor was forced to end a proxy battle in February after Disney agreed to restructure its business and launch an effort to reduce costs by about $5.5 billion.With the changes, Peltz ended his quest for a board seat after CEO Iger laid out plans for cutting 7,000 jobs as part of the cost-cutting measures.

Speculation was rife that it could buy Mondelez.Peltz discussed with Mondelez management the company's operations capital structure and corporate governance. In early 2014, Mondelez announced Peltz was to join the board after criticizing the company for doing little to cut costs. He joined the board as part of a compromise agreement that resulted in him ending his push to have PepsiCo acquire Mondelez International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PEP) to spin-off the beverage unit from its flourishing snacks division.""Two leaner and more entrepreneurial companies"" through the spinoff would boost sales and margins in the snacks business, while the drinks business would generate a stable flow of cash that could be returned to shareholders, Peltz said.CEO Indra Nooyi shot down the spin-off efforts, insisting that a split up would hurt PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s ability to negotiate with retail customers. The feud only came to an end when PepsiCo agreed to allow a representative of Peltz's fund to join the board.Trian Partners exited its position in the beverage giant in 2016, three years after launching a campaign to have PepsiCo, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

Its opportunistic investment policy and a robust balance sheet augur well. However, a choppy office real estate market amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest rates makes us apprehensive.SLG is witnessing healthy leasing demand for its properties as tenants’ demand for premium office spaces continues to grow. Notably, in the six months ended Jun 30, 2023, it signed 84 office leases for its Manhattan office portfolio spanning around 915,431 square feet.Given that office-space demand in the upcoming period is likely to be driven by de-densification to allow higher square footage per office worker, SLG’s encouraging leasing pipeline positions it well to navigate the present challenging environment.Moreover, this office real estate investment trust (REIT) enjoys a diversified tenant base with a strong credit profile. This lowers the risk associated with dependency on single-industry tenants and assures stable rental revenues for the company. For 2023, we estimate a year-over-year increase of 5.8% in net rental revenues.To enhance its overall portfolio quality, the company follows an opportunistic investment policy.  It divests the mature and non-core assets and utilizes the proceeds to fund development projects and share buybacks. Such efforts highlight its prudent capital-management practices and preserve financial flexibility.In June 2023, SLG divested a 49.9% interest in 245 Park Avenue to a U.S. affiliate of Mori Trust Co., Ltd. The transaction valued the asset at $2.0 billion and forms a pivotal component of SL Green's 2023 financial strategy.The company maintains a robust balance sheet position and had $1 billion of liquidity as of Jun 30, 2023. Its healthy financial footing positions it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Analysts seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $5.56.Shares of the company have gained 43.6% in the past three months against the industry’s 2.7% fall.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, a choppy office market environment amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty is likely to soften the demand for office properties in the near term, raising concerns for this office REIT.Competition from industry peers may limit the company’s ability to retain tenants at relatively higher rents, denting its pricing power. Also, the elevated supply of office properties may adversely impact SL Green’s ability to backfill near-term tenant move-outs and vacancies, hurting occupancy.Further, given the prevailing high interest rate environment, SL Green may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. Our estimate suggests a significant year-over-year increase in net interest expenses in 2023.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Welltower’s 2023 FFO per share has been raised marginally over the past month to $3.53.The consensus estimate for SBA Communications’ current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past month to $12.88.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Americold Realty Trust’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 3.3% over the past month to $1.26.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our expectation for the same was pegged at 92.4%.For the 12 months ended Jun 30, 2023, re-leasing spreads were 11.3% more than the expiring base rent.Same-center NOI, including lease termination income, increased marginally year over year to $193.6 million.

However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Warren Buffett's portfolio and dividend stocks, and go directly to read 5 Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history, has shown a preference for investing in dividend stocks throughout his career. The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has often mentioned that he likes companies with a history of consistent and growing dividends. These stocks are attractive to him because they provide a steady stream of income, which he views as a source of cash flow that can be reinvested in other opportunities. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are some of the most prominent Warren Buffett dividend stocks that the billionaire has been investing in for quite some time.Buffett's dividend investing strategy is a cornerstone of his successful approach to stock market investing. He is known for his patient approach to investing and buying stocks with the intention of holding them for the long term, often for years or even decades. This long-term perspective allows him to benefit from the power of compounding and ride out market volatility. In one of our previous articles, we reported Buffett’s dedication to long-term investing through his ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Back in 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million in cash dividends from its $1.3 billion investment in Coca-Cola. Fast forward to last year, and that dividend payment saw a remarkable increase, reaching $704 million. This shows how Buffett's patient approach can lead to substantial returns over time.Buffett’s investment philosophy of holding stocks for the long haul is widely regarded as a key factor in his success as an investor. Peter Kunhardt, a director of the HBO documentary ""Becoming Warren Buffett,"" explained in a 2017 interview that Buffett recognizes that “you don’t have to trade things all the time; you can sit on things, too. You don’t have to make many decisions in life to make a lot of money.”Story continuesBuffett pays close attention to the sectors and industries he is investing in as a fundamental part of his investment strategy. As of the end of Q2 2023, the tech sector dominated his portfolio, while financials, basic materials, and consumer goods also made up significant portions of his investments.

IR is well-poised for growth, courtesy of the company’s solid product portfolio, innovation capabilities and focus on boosting its aftermarket businesses.Let’s delve into the factors, which make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company a smart investment choice at the moment.Business Strength: Ingersoll Rand’s Industrial Technologies &amp; Services segment is benefiting from solid demand. The company continues to see higher orders across its product portfolio of compressors, vacuum and blowers, and power tools and lifting within the Industrial Technologies &amp; Services unit.Pricing actions and acquired assets are boosting revenues in the Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment. Also, exposure to various end markets, including industrial manufacturing, mining &amp; construction, energy, transportation, medical and laboratory sciences, food and beverage packaging as well as chemical processing, should help Ingersoll Rand offset weaknesses associated with a single market.Expansion Efforts: IR has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. The company acquired SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business in January 2023. The buyout boosted IR’s core compressor product offering through a complementary product portfolio of energy-efficient compressed air dryers, filters and other consumables. The Air Treatment business is currently a part of IR’s Industrial Technologies and Services segment.The acquisition of Dosatron International (October 2022) expanded Ingersoll Rand’s digital technology portfolio, opening up opportunities in hydroponics, horticulture, animal health, food safety and sanitation along with water treatment end markets, where Dosatron had a strong presence. Dosatron is now a part of Ingersoll Rand’s Precision and Science Technologies segment. In second-quarter 2023, acquisitions contributed 5.9% to Ingersoll Rand’s total revenues. For 2023, the company anticipates mergers/acquisitions to contribute $300 million to total revenues.Rewards to Shareholders: The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks. In the first six months of 2023, the company paid out dividends of $16.2 million and repurchased shares worth $132.8 million.Northbound Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IR’s 2023 earnings has been revised 2.2% upward.Price Performance: Shares of the company have gained 42% in the past year compared with the industry’s 16.3% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Caterpillar Inc.

The Style Score rates stocks on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth and most promising momentum.Favorable FactorsLet’s delve deeper to unearth the factors working in favor of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $7.15, indicating an increase of 237%. LNC beat earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters, missing on two other occasions.The Group Protection segment continued to see improved growth and profitability in the first half of 2023. This segment contributed one-third to the operating earnings in the second quarter, and management expects this to continue in the future. We expect total revenues to rise 3.3% in 2023. LNC expects to sustain a margin of 7% over the long term, thanks to strategic initiatives taken by the company to grow this business. Improved sales of supplemental health products should continue to drive growth in this segment.The company’s operating cash flow is expected to improve in the future as it continues to execute its strategy of generating solid cash flow by investing in profitable businesses. Although, it took a hit in the first half of 2023, as the company realizes savings from its Spark Initiative, cash flow is likely to increase. The company also expects to generate improved cash flow following the close of the Fortitude Re block reinsurance transaction. Following this transaction, free cash flow is anticipated to increase $100 million per year.Story continuesLincoln National expects sales to grow in the annuity segment for 2023, driven by product enhancements and tie-ups. As LNC enhances its value propositions, certain measures taken with the distribution partners are expected to further drive sales in the second half of 2023.The company reported an increase of 7.9% in net investment income for the second quarter. A high-interest rate environment should continue to be a tailwind for this metric.The company’s sturdy capital position supports effective capital deployment. LNC’s dividend yield is currently 7.1%, much higher than the industry’s average of 3.9%. It bought back shares worth $76 million in the first half of 2023. At the second-quarter end, it had a remaining security repurchase authorization of $714 million.RisksDespite the upside potential, there are some factors that investors should keep an eye out for.The company’s troubled Life Insurance segment is weighing on the company’s results. The pre-tax income declined 52.7% in the second quarter of 2023. The company expects this segment to remain a headwind as it would take time to benefit from a shift in the product mix. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive long-term growth.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space include Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Aflac Incorporated AFL and Chubb Limited CB.

Emily Brannon, a hospital teacher and educational advocate at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, works with families to make this transition as easy as possible. Emily recently met with a sickle cell patient and his parents who were concerned about their son beginning kindergarten and wanted to make sure his teacher and administrators were aware of his medical needs.""I was able to set up a meeting with the school principal, kindergarten teacher and the patient's parents to provide handouts explaining sickle cell disease and discuss what was most important for this patient and his family,"" said Brannon. ""Schools have processes in place for children with medical needs, and through my educational advocacy and the parents' opportunity to share their personal concerns, the school was able to provide appropriate support and accommodations for this student as he began his elementary experience.""Emily is part of the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center's family support team, which is completely donor-funded. In early 2023, the Aflac Foundation contributed $1.5 million to the family support team to help provide needed services.

400,1022faf6-0efa-30e4-92d6-0f91fe38989e,AFL,2023-09-08,7 Cash Cow Stocks for Recession-Resilient Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-cash-cow-stocks-recession-165141139.html,1693587101,STORY,"['AFL', 'VZ', 'KOF', 'BRK-B', 'O', 'JNJ', 'WM']","[The rally we’ve seen in previous weeks has given investors a breath of fresh air, but I believe volatility is likely to persist over the next few months. With the Federal Reserve committed to further rate hikes, turbulence could easily return to the markets later this year. While I don’t foresee an imminent recession, taking some risk off the table seems prudent. Many big tech names have seen stellar gains over the past decade but now look vulnerable to plateauing or even pulling back if recessionary winds start blowing.With that in mind, taking profits from overvalued big tech stocks and redeploying that capital into more stable dividend payers or more under-appreciated growth stocks is a decent idea. I’ll be focusing on the former.Although these stocks may not capture headlines like the tech darlings do, their steady payouts and defensive business models make them appealing options during uncertain times. By favoring these dividend stocks over inflated big tech names, you can generate safe and consistent income while waiting for lower valuations for higher-growth stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is in the business of providing supplemental insurance products. This business is generally boring, but continues to deliver steady growth, even in turbulent markets. The company posted a strong second quarter, beating earnings estimates by 14 cents per share. A key growth driver has been Aflac’s cancer insurance sales, which were up 60% in Q2 versus a year ago. The launch of Aflac’s new WINGS cancer product in the Japan Post channel in April also provided a significant boost to the company’s growth.While economic uncertainty persists, Aflac’s supplemental insurance products remain attractive to consumers looking to protect themselves financially. The company expects to sustain momentum with the upcoming launch of a new medical product in September. Though some analysts have expressed concerns about Aflac’s exposure to currency fluctuations, the company has taken steps to reduce this risk. Given its leading market share, sticky customer base, and prudent financial management, Aflac seems poised to continue generating predictable earnings and dividends for income investors.Story continuesNotably, AFL stock provides investors with a forward dividend yield of 2.25%, rising for four decades straight.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continues delivering strong fundamental performance, posting Q2 results that beat earnings expectations by 18 cents per share. The healthcare giant’s sales grew 6.3%, demonstrating the strength of J&amp;J’s diversified business model spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health.Key pharmaceutical growth drivers included the company’s oncology portfolio and new product launches like CARVYKTI and TECVAYLI for multiple myeloma treatment. J&amp;J’s pipeline progress also looks promising, with upcoming catalysts across its key future assets. Meanwhile, the company’s MedTech segment grew 15% operationally, aided by the recent Abiomed acquisition.As a sweetener, Johnson &amp; Johnson offers a forward dividend yield of 2.9%, as well as an impressive history of 62 consecutive years of dividend hikes. Analysts believe year-end growth will come in around the 5.5% level, along with 6% earnings per share growth.Waste Management (WM)Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comThough Waste Management (NYSE:WM) faced some revenue headwinds in Q2 from lower commodity prices, the company continues generating shareholder value through its pricing power, cost discipline, and a steady dividend. Waste collection is a resilient business, providing essential services even during economic downturns.Waste Management boosted its adjusted operating EBITDA margin by 60 basis points in Q2 via diligent cost control and SG&amp;A optimization. While management modestly reduced full-year revenue guidance due to commodity pricing pressures, the company still expects to deliver adjusted EBITDA growth of 5.7% at the midpoint for 2023.Looking ahead, the company’s management team aims to expand EBITDA margins by capturing synergies from technology investments and leaning into price increases to offset inflationary pressures. With its wide economic moat and earnings per share growth projected to come in around 6-7% in 2023, WM stock offers an attractive blend of defensiveness, income and growth. It currently yields a modest 1.8%, but its distribution have increased for two decades straight.Realty Income (O)hand of person in a suit dangling keys with a house symbol on the ring. Windows overlooking city skyline in background.Source: ImageFlow/shutterstock.comDespite headwinds from higher interest rates, Realty Income (NYSE:O) continues generating steady growth driven by its high-quality real estate portfolio. The company has maintained an impressive 99% occupancy rate over the past three quarters, demonstrating the durability of its properties and tenant relationships. Management expects investments to exceed $7 billion in 2023, with the company leveraging its scale and relationships to source accretive deals even in today’s capital-constrained environment.While some investors fear a pullback in commercial real estate, Realty Income’s focus on service-oriented and low price point industries should provide resilience. Currently, O stock offers an attractive 5.4% dividend yield, with investors paying only 13.6-times forward funds from operations, with a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. It’s a bargain when you consider that the average analyst believes Realty Income will post 16.5% year-over-year sales growth this year and 11% next year. Some bulls believe the real estate giant’s revenue growth could come in as high as 30% by the end of 2026. Plus, even the lowest recent price target on Wall Street is $5 higher than its current price.Verizon (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) has faced endless headwinds lately, with its stock price down nearly 20% over the past year amid concerns about subscriber losses, lead concerns and competitive pressures. Verizon did deliver a Q2 earnings beat, but it missed revenue estimates. Still, various metrics show momentum in key growth areas like fixed wireless access. Verizon added 384,000 fixed wireless subscribers in Q2, surpassing 2.3 million total, and on pace to hit its target of 4-5 million subscribers by 2025.The company’s 5G network expansions are also paying off, with improved customer retention and higher average revenue per user. Looking ahead, Verizon expects to continue improving its 5G coverage and performance as more C-band spectrum comes online. With the stock now trading at just 7-times forward earnings, Verizon looks very undervalued considering its strong wireless network, 5G progress, and growth potential in fixed wireless broadband. For investors seeking an underappreciated telecom giant with a rock-solid dividend, Verizon checks all the boxes. The forward dividend yield with VZ stock is 7.5%, but that’s unlikely to remain stable due to price volatility.Coca-Cola Femsa (KOF)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola Femsa (NYSE:KOF) has quietly delivered impressive growth, with Q2 revenues up 30.2%. This Coke bottling partner serves over 270 million consumers across Latin America and saw 7% volume growth in Q2, driven by Mexico, Brazil, and Guatemala.Coca-Cola Femsa is leveraging brand strength, product innovations like low-sugar drinks, and improved distribution to gain share in growing markets. Its omnichannel Juntos+ B2B platform now accounts for 30% of revenues in its traditional trade channel. With shares trading at 17-times forward earnings and also providing a 3.7% dividend yield, Coca-Cola Femsa offers stability with untapped growth potential thanks to its leading position in an expanding region.Analysts expect sales growth to be nearly 17.5% for all of 2023. Sales would match its current market cap in roughly 4 years, which makes KOF stock very appealing, even after its recent appreciation.Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comLed by the legendary Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) remains a core holding for many long-term investors, even if the stock isn’t cheap. Berkshire’s diversified business mix provides earnings power and stability across market cycles. Operating earnings grew 6.6% in Q2, aided by higher insurance investment income, though several units faced challenges like BNSF Rail and Berkshire’s housing-related businesses. Berkshire’s insurance float hit $166 billion, providing ample capital to deploy. With over $147 billion in cash, Berkshire can capitalize on market dislocations when times get tough. Thus, this is a stock to hold for the very long-term, for most investors.Sure, it’s expensive right now, but the stock’s premium valuation is justified by the unmatched track record of Buffett and his team. For investors willing to pay up to gain exposure to his disciplines and investment acumen, Berkshire Hathaway belongs in any high-quality, long-term portfolio. Unfortunately, it does not pay out dividends directly, but holds many stocks that do.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The companies escalating operating costs are affecting profits. A debt-laden balance sheet induces a rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, Humana's Medicaid business benefits from several contract wins and renewals thereby contributing to top line. Strategic buyouts and alliances place it well for growth in the future.Solid contributions from the Insurance and CenterWell segments bode well. Management estimates adjusted 2023 EPS to be at least $28.25, reflecting minimum growth of 12% year over year. It has been deploying excess capital through share buybacks and dividend payments on balance sheet strength.(You can read the full research report on Humana here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Cintas’ shares have outperformed the Zacks Uniform and Related industry over the year-to-date period (+10.6% vs. +9.2%). Strong segmental performances have been aiding the company. Increased productivity level and new product launches are boosting the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment’s performances.Strength in the health and wellness businesses and high customer retention levels are driving the growth of the First Aid and Safety Services segment. The company's focus on enhancement of its product portfolio holds promise. Cintas’ efforts to reward shareholders are impressive.However, the rising cost of sales, and increasing selling and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. High tax rate is an added concern for Cintas. Also, foreign currency headwinds are weighing on the company's top line.(You can read the full research report on Cintas here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Biogen have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+26.8% vs. -10.8%). The company’s potential new products like Leqembi in Alzheimer’s disease, Qalsody in ALS and zuranolone in depression can help revive growth. With Leqembi receiving traditional approval and broader CMS coverage in the United States, it has the potential to generate blockbuster sales.Biogen is exploring both early to mid-stage assets and late-stage assets to build its pipeline. However, Biogen’s has a high-risk pipeline. Sales of Leqembi are expected to be slow in 2023.  It is also facing multiple challenges at present like the generic erosion of Tecfidera, competitive pressure for Spinraza, declining profit share of Rituxan in the United States and the failure of Aduhelm.

Accelerating digital investments also bodes well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (“RTD”) alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Company KO, PepsiCo Inc. PEP, Fomento Economico Mexicano FMX, Monster Beverage Corporation MNST and Keurig Dr Pepper KDP are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies’ actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio. The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.What's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share. The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Soft drink companies have been gaining from improved demand trends, aiding volume growth. Due to recovery across markets, market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels have been boosting sales. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly lifted sales in recent quarters. The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers’ consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018. The industry players are also exploring CBD-infused drinks, which have been gaining popularity lately.Raw Material Cost Inflation and Supply Constraints: The beverage industry has higher supply-chain costs, including higher commodity input costs and transportation expenses. Raw material cost inflation, particularly steel and aluminum, has increased packaging costs. The ongoing supply constraints in the aluminum can industry have been other headwinds. The companies are also witnessing delays in procuring certain ingredients, domestically and internationally, leading to shortages of some goods. The industry players have been facing freight inefficiencies and significant increases in domestic and international freight costs. Logistic issues, higher input costs and freight inefficiencies have resulted in higher sales and operating expenses costs, impacting gross and operating margins. Most players expect commodity cost inflation and higher transportation costs to persist in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages - Soft Drinks industry is housed within the broader Consumer Staples sector.

Shares have lost about 3.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Halozyme Therapeutics due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Halozyme Q2 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat EstimatesHalozyme delivered second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The company recorded earnings of 53 cents per share in the year-ago period.Total revenues increased 45% year over year to $221 million in the second quarter. This was primarily driven by an increase in milestone revenues due to the approval and launch of partner Argenx’s Vyvgart Hytrulo.The addition of product sales following the acquisition of Antares Pharma and higher royalty payments from J&amp;J for subcutaneous Darzalex (daratumumab) also boosted the top line.Revenues in the reported quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $202 million.Quarterly HighlightsHalozyme’s top line comprises of product sales, royalties and revenues under collaborative agreements.Royalty revenues totaled $111.7 million in the first quarter, up 31% from the year-ago quarter’s level. This was mainly due to robust demand for JNJ’s subcutaneous Darzalex. Royalty revenues accounted for nearly 51% of the company’s net revenues during the reported quarter. Royalty revenues beat our model estimate of $100.4 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.8 million.Product sales totaled $73.9 million, about 60% higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Halozyme supplies API to ENHANZE partners like JNJ and Roche, which contributed to product revenues. Product sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $69.4 million and our estimate of $60.7 million.  Story continuesRevenues under collaborative agreements amounted to $35.4 million, up about 71% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Collaboration revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37 million as well as our estimate of $37.1 million.Adjusted EBITDA was registered at $115.1 million in the second quarter, marking a 31.2% increase from the prior-year quarter’s level.Adjusted Net Income increased 30% to $98.4 million in the reported quarter.Halozyme had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $348.3 million as of Jun 30, 2023, compared with $275.6 million as of Mar 31, 2023.2023 Guidance UpdatedHalozyme increased the lower end of its previously issued revenue guidance to reflect its strong second-quarter results.The company raised its total revenue expectations from $815-$845 million to $825-$845 million for 2023, indicating year-over-year growth of 25-28%. This improvement reflects continued higher royalty revenues from Darzalex SC and Phesgo, along with strong growth in royalty revenues and product sales.Revenues from royalties are anticipated to increase approximately 23-26% to $445-$455 million year over year (unchanged).The EBITDA projection has also been raised from $415-$440 million to $420-$440 million, excluding amortization costs, implying year-over-year growth of more than 30%.The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.65-$2.75 per share, up from $2.50-$2.65 (excluding stock-based compensation expenses), indicating an improvement of 20% year over year. Halozyme’s EPS guidance does not consider the impact of potential future share repurchases.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresCurrently, Halozyme Therapeutics has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with an A. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Halozyme Therapeutics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerHalozyme Therapeutics is part of the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry. Over the past month, Regeneron (REGN), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4.2%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.Regeneron reported revenues of $3.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.5%. EPS of $10.24 for the same period compares with $9.77 a year ago.For the current quarter, Regeneron is expected to post earnings of $10.98 per share, indicating a change of -1.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.Regeneron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on the overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions.
