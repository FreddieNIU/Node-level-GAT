A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. Basically the company is earning less on its investments and it is also reducing its total assets. Having said that, after a brief look, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) we aren't filled with optimism, but let's investigate further.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Nordstrom is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.098 = US$514m ÷ (US$8.8b - US$3.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).Thus, Nordstrom has an ROCE of 9.8%.  On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 10%. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom roceIn the above chart we have measured Nordstrom's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Nordstrom's ROCE Trending?We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at Nordstrom. About five years ago, returns on capital were 20%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Nordstrom becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that Nordstrom has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 40%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.In Conclusion...In the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. We expect this has contributed to the stock plummeting 72% during the last five years. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.Nordstrom does have some risks though, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Nordstrom  that you might be interested in.While Nordstrom may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes and you only need $100.Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."" Here's how to collect $1,000 per month from Buffett's favorite dividend stock.For instance, you must carefully screen potential tenants, prepare lease agreements and ensure that rent is paid on time. Chasing lease payments and dealing with delinquent tenants is never fun.Landlords are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of their properties, which can require frequent repairs and updates. They also must secure proper insurance coverage for their properties and pay property taxes, which can require ongoing attention.All of this can make supposedly passive income a lot less passive — and that's if you can put together a hefty down payment, get a mortgage and buy a house in the first place. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate in the U.S. is now at 7.12%.The good news? You don't have to become a landlord to get a piece of the action.Earn Monthly Rental Income Without Becoming A LandlordReal estate investment trusts (REITs) are a way to own real estate without the hassle of property management. REITs can be thought of as giant landlords — they own income-producing real estate and collect rent from tenants.REITs are legally required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends, making them appealing to investors looking to earn passive income.Story continuesPlenty of REITs trade on the stock market, so it's easy to invest in them. You can purchase shares of a REIT much like you would buy stocks of a company.And while most dividend-paying companies follow a quarterly distribution schedule, some REITs pay their shareholders monthly.For instance, Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O) is a REIT that brands itself as ""The Monthly Dividend Company."" Through its 54-year operating history, the company has declared 638 consecutive monthly dividends.Better yet, Realty Income has increased its payout 122 times since going public in 1994.Today, the REIT pays monthly dividends of 25.6 cents per share, translating to an annual yield of 6.1%.If you want to earn $1,000 every month from Realty Income, you would need to own 3,906.25 shares of the REIT. This is calculated by dividing the $1,000 by the per share monthly payout of $0.256.And because Realty Income currently trades at $49.94 per share, 3,906.25 shares would mean about $195,078 worth of the stock.If you aim for a smaller target of earning $200 per month, you would need 781.25 shares ($200 / $0.256), or $39,015 worth of Realty Income stock (781.25 x $49.94).Like other stocks, REITs can be volatile. Despite its impressive dividend-paying track record, Realty Income shares have fallen 13% in 2023.RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Heffern sees a rebound on the horizon. The analyst has an Outperform rating on Realty Income and a price target of $67, implying a potential upside of 21%.This is an example of how real estate investors can earn passive income without becoming a landlord. But like any investment, REITs come with risks, and dividends are not carved in stone. So always conduct comprehensive research and due diligence before diving in.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

9,0cffe20e-65cf-33e6-b988-94220936bbc7,O,2023-09-17,Is Realty Income's (O) Latest Dividend Hike Sustainable?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realty-incomes-o-latest-dividend-142700736.html,1694615220,STORY,['O'],"[Boosting shareholders’ wealth, Realty Income Corporation O announced an increase in its common stock monthly cash dividend to 25.60 cents per share from 25.55 cents paid out earlier. This marked its 122nd common stock monthly dividend hike since its listing on the NYSE in 1994.The increased dividend will be paid out on Oct 13 to shareholders on record as of Oct 2, 2023. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $3.072 per share compared with the prior rate of $3.066. Based on the company’s share price of $55.15 on Sep 12, the latest hike results in a dividend yield of 5.57%.Though the latest hike marks a marginal increase from the prior dividend, the latest dividend announced will be the company’s 639th consecutive monthly dividend payout in its 54-year operating history.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticements for real estate investment trust (REIT) investors, and Realty Income is committed to boosting its shareholder wealth. This retail REIT holds the trademark of the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company.” It has made 104 consecutive quarterly dividend hikes. This retail REIT has witnessed compound average annual dividend growth of 4.3% since its listing on the NYSE.Moreover, Realty Income has increased its dividend 23 times in the last five years and has a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 3.05%. Check Realty Income’s dividend history here.The latest hike reflects O’s ability to generate decent cash flow through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. It derives a majority of its annualized retail contractual rental revenues from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and low-price-point component to their business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing. These provide more reliable streams of income, which boost the stability of rental revenues and generate predictable cash flows. For 2023, we estimate rental revenues (including reimbursables) to increase 15.6% year over year.Also, the company’s diversified tenant base and accretive buyouts bode well for its growth. In August, Realty Income unveiled that it would invest around $950 million in The Bellagio, situated at the center of the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, NV, at a valuation of $5.1 billion. This marks the retail REIT’s second investment in the gaming industry. The latest move is in sync with the company’s portfolio diversification efforts.Moreover, Realty Income maintains a healthy balance sheet position and exited the second quarter of 2023 with $3.5 billion of liquidity. The company ended the quarter with modest leverage and strong coverage metrics with net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAre of 5.3X and a fixed charge coverage of 4.6X. O also enjoys a credit rating of A- (Stable) and A3 (Stable) from Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, enabling it to procure debt financing at attractive costs.With ample financial flexibility, the company remains well-poised to tide over any challenges and bank on growth scopes. Moreover, with healthy operating fundamentals, a lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry and a solid financial position, we expect the latest dividend rate to be sustainable.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises its risks associated with tenant default. Also, high interest rates add to its concerns. Our estimate for interest expenses indicates a year-over-year rise of 37.2% in 2023.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 9.9% in the past three months, wider than its industry’s decrease of 1%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Robinhood Stocks with Biggest Upside.The stock market gains seen this year despite rising inflation, rate hikes and recession fears have emboldened market bulls. Many now believe the next year would be a spectacular one for the stock market and stocks would touch new highs. In July, Ed Yardeni from Yardeni Research said that a soft landing is now inevitable and the broader market is now on track to see record gains in 2024. Yardeni said in his note that the bull market that started in October 2022 would last until at least the end of 2023. He said at the time that he was seeing S&amp;P 500 somewhere around 4,800 and 5,400 over the next 18 months. Yardeni, did not however, rule out the chances of a broader correction. He said that the S&amp;P 500 is indeed hot and the NASDAQ is even hotter. However, he said that any meltdown in stocks would be a temporary correction rather than the start of a bear market which many of the Wall Street analysts have been warning about ever since the bull market started. Yardeni said that some analysts are too pessimistic. He sees S&amp;P 500 earnings to hit $270 per share by 2025.The $75 Trillion Reason Behind Market OptimismYardeni at the time said that the chances of a soft landing and a disinflationary scenario were growing. His predictions are yet to be validated since investors are still in a wait-and-see mode. Inflation is still high but showing signs of settling down and labor market is also showing signs of cooling. In his July note, Yardeni set the odds of a recession over the next two and a half years at just 25%. Part of the reason why Yardeni was optimistic on the market was his belief that baby boomers have a whopping $75 trillion in wealth in savings, liquid assets, real estate, and other investments. Yardeni believes consumer spending will remain strong. He thinks we won’t face a broader recession and instead, certain parts of the economy would face contracting while other areas will keep expanding.Story continuesHowever, Goldman Sachs does not agree with the $75 trillion reason. In a report, Goldman Sachs talked about the risks to the US economy in 2024 and said that US household savings are dwindling fast.“Economists now estimate household savings to be around $350 billion, which could run out by the first quarter of 2024. This coincides with the reinstatement of student loan payments, which may dampen spending, and an aggressive build-up of credit card balances, with interest costs that have soared to historical highs of more than 20%.”Goldman also said that US government spending might slow down in the near future amid debt ratings downgrades. US government spending will face increased scrutiny in the future which could hamper spending on major government projects. If spending from the government slows down, the trickle-down effect could cause a wider slowdown in money circulation.JPMorgan also voiced similar concerns in a latest report. The bank’s analysts said that “cracks” have started to appear in the labor market which was a bright spot throughout the market storm. Data shows that the rate of job openings is slowing down and baby boomers are permanently leaving the workforce. JPMorgan said the cooling labor market could be a sign that the economy is entering a recession.“Overall, the U.S. economy should continue to grow at a tempered pace from here, and while a recession is not guaranteed, a slower-moving economy will be increasingly sensitive to shocks. There remain risks on the horizon, most notably weakness in commercial real estate, that could push this slow-moving economy into a recession within the next year.”Robinhood Stocks with Biggest UpsidePhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article, we conducted a broader survey of some of the top financial websites and picked 11 Robinhood stocks these top websites believe have the biggest upside potential.

(NASDAQ:XELA) is one of the Robinhood stocks financial media believes has upside potential. So far this year Exela Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:XELA) has lost 75% in value. The company’s revenue in the second quarter increased by about 2%.Exela Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:XELA)’s executive chairman Par Chadha said during a latest earnings call that the company is going through a rough patch. Answering a question, the executive said:“What I referred to was, when we were going through a rough patch, we were in-line to win some of the bid, some of the RFPs, but because of the rough patch, we were not able to win those. The business climate still remains challenging, but however, the business of process automation, as I think I mentioned that in couple of my other calls. It’s a little contrarian, meaning people when they reduce our customers, when they reduce their headcount, they look for variable costs, which means companies like ours benefit from providing at scale services, during the periods of uncertainty in the macro environment. So, I think we are going to see some good wins to help us, grow our business. But our fundamental value proposition, obviously, is driving stability, recurring revenue, and as well as very high renewal rate.”7.

But the stock jumped in August after the company reached a debt restructuring deal with its lenders.Miller Value Deep Value Strategy made the following comment about Tupperware Brands Corporation (NYSE:TUP) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the quarter we only had one detractor, Tupperware Brands Corporation (NYSE:TUP) whose share price was down more than 30%. The company is in a midst of a multi-year transformation focused on enhancing their global direct selling business, expanding their omnichannel presence, exiting non-core assets, rolling out new product innovation and enhancing the company technology and supply chain. Tupperware’s revenues have been adversely impacted by significant market weakness in Europe and China along with the company experiencing weaker volumes from implementing recent price increases. Management has undertaken a $100M cost reduction program and with the recent price actions beginning to offset commodity price pressures, the company should see profitability and cash flow generation improve over the coming year. In addition, management continues to make incremental investments in the business to further expand their omni-channel efforts and modernize their infrastructure. While it will take longer for the company to complete the turnaround plan, we believe the current share price has limited value for successfully completing the transformation.”6. SoundHound AI, Inc.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Archer-Daniels-Midland's (NYSE:ADM) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Archer-Daniels-Midland, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$4.1b ÷ (US$55b - US$19b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 11%. By itself that's a normal return on capital and it's in line with the industry's average returns of 11%.

15,36a3a6bf-1900-3c65-8cc5-ef4d82a71e62,ADM,2023-09-17,20 Biggest American Food Exports in Recent Years,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-american-food-exports-130141558.html,1694869301,STORY,['ADM'],"[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest American food exports in recent years. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest American food exports by year.The food industry in the U.S. is an absolute giant, and it is one of the top food exporting countries in the world, being the global leader in the export of various types of food. In 2021, U.S. agricultural trade reached record levels and exports alone were valued at $177 billion, while this increased further by 11% in 2022 to reached $196 billion, with high value products accounting for nearly 75% of total food exports. While the U.S. may be an industrial nation and the most advanced country in the world, these aforementioned statistics show that its agricultural output is significant too, and it's advancements in technology that have led to increased agricultural output.Tech advancements in the food industryWhile tech advancements have led to massive growth in industrial nations, such advancements have been successfully applied to the more traditional agricultural sector to improve yield and efficiency, while significantly lowering costs. While such technologies have been implemented in the agricultural industry since the 20th century, exponential development has led to tech becoming much more associated with farming and agriculture in the 21st century and especially in the last two decades, and companies such as Bayer, one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are embracing this wholeheartedly, with Bayer creating a division called Bayer Crop Sciences to merge science and agriculture. Bayer Crop Sciences provides several such innovative solutions including using innovative digital tools and data science where farmers are able to use data aggregated through third parties and satellites while also incorporating machine learning techniques. Additional tech advancements come in the form of using remote sensors which have the ability to diagnose yield-impacting field issues, while the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, is also gaining in popularity, though not in countries where drones are banned.Story continues20 Biggest American Food Exports by YearPhoto by Darla Hueske on UnsplashWhile Bayer Crop Sciences isn't the only company which merges farming and technology, it is considered to be a market leader and Bayer Crop Sciences recorded an exceptionally strong year with sales increasing by 15.6% to over 25 billion euros, and expect a further 3% growth in its Crop Sciences division. The division also launched new products which aim to not just improve harvest effectively, but also considerably reduce environmental impact. This was called out by the company in its Q2 2023 earnings call stating "" In June, our market leading Crop Science business articulated a vision for regenerative agriculture that's good for on-farm productivity. It's good for farmer incomes and it's good for the earth. And the faster we can translate this into revenue growth, the better for all. It's great to see the first registrations coming in for our Preceon Smart Corn System, a climate resilient version of one of the most important crops for agriculture and for Bayer."" The company mentioned further additional technologies in the same call, mentioning ""I would highlight the continued upgrade of our most significant segment, our industry leading Corn Seed &amp; Traits business as an example. Growers across the Americas continue to demand more of our third generation corn rootworm control trait with RNAi technology, building on an important insect control offering in our portfolio. Even more exciting are the ongoing farm trials around the globe for the Preceon Smart Corn System, featuring our short stature corn. This product has the potential to change how farmers grow corn and for the better with less yield loss to the high winds, more optimized fertilizer and crop protection use, better field access and season long and opportunity for higher planting densities, we see a potential fit on 220 million acres around the globe and more than EUR1.5 billion in peak sales potential."" These technologies have also been major contributors to the most exported American food exports by year.GMOs and their futureGMOs, or genetically modified organisms, gained in popularity from Monsanto, which was one of the biggest food companies in the world before its purchase by Bayer in 2016, in a deal worth $66 billion. While GMOs still attract significant controversy, they are hugely beneficial in terms of yield and are the reasons why U.S. has some of the highest food exports in the world. A study conducted in this respect concluded that using GM technology resulted in crop yields increasing by a stunning 21%, not because of higher genetic yield potential but due to better pest control and hence, less crop damage and wastage. Since GM crops are already better at pest control, this also results in less usage of pesticides which further decreases costs. While GM seeds are more expensive than normal ones, the savings in pesticides meant that farmers using GM seeds actually had higher profits by 69%, and the biggest American food exports are continuing to see a rise in production and export numbers precisely because of technology like this.Genetically modified foods also have another large benefit for the future; they are much more resistant to climate change than ordinary crops. As the impact of climate change continues to be felt year on year, many crops including staples such as potatoes, maize and wheat not to mention wealthier crops including coffee and cocoa have seen yields decline in the countries most impacted by climate change, and the usage of genetically modified crops may help alleviate some of this crisis.Outlook of the U.S. food industryThe growth exhibited by the U.S. food industry is expected to growth an incredible CAGR of over 10% from 2022 to 2030, and is likely to cross $1.7 trillion in total market size, which allows for a lot of potential in terms of growth for some of the biggest food companies in the U.S., including Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), which mentioned how its continuing to increase output in its Q2 2023 earnings call, stating ""Our Spiritwood, North Dakota processing facilities is scheduled to start up in Q4, adding 1.5 million metric tons of annual soy crush capacity to our portfolio and producing low carbon intensity soybean oil for our JV partner Marathon's nearby renewable diesel facility. Projects like this will support growing demand for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel throughout the industry. We also see continued resilience in food demand for core products. We expect the continued solid margin and volume environment for sweeteners, starches and flavors. We are beginning to convert our pipeline of wins in Human Nutrition into operating profit. Where there are some factors that have hindered growth in the portfolio, we believe positive momentum from Flavors is a predictor of a healthy rebound."" Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) also went on to discuss the impact of technology and food production in the call, stating ""Our new Decatur protein solution center is engaged in ADM's world-class science and technology capabilities to deliver on tomorrow's most important consumer nutrition trends. Collaboration between ADM and our ventures partners take us beyond today's alternative protein sources to help address critical areas of sustainability, wellness and affordability. Leveraging our deep fermentation expertise and capacity is positioning us to scale the next generation of food, feed, fuel, fabrics and other industrial products with key partners. The combination of technology alongside global trends in sustainability, food security and well-being is transforming the food and agriculture industry at the fastest pace since the last century. And ADM is at the forefront of this transformation and connected growth opportunities, which give us even more confidence in our long-range growth plans.""MethodologyTo determine the biggest American food exports by year, we headed over to the United States Department of Agriculture, which has statistics on each type of food exported by year and its total value.

(NYSE:PM) will increase its dividend on the 12th of October to $1.30, which is 2.4% higher than last year's payment from the same period of $1.27. This takes the annual payment to 5.3% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Philip Morris International's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 98% of what it was earning. It will be difficult to sustain this level of payout so we wouldn't be confident about this continuing.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 47.4% over the next year. Under the assumption that the dividend will continue along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 70% which would be quite comfortable going to take the dividend forward.historic-dividendPhilip Morris International Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $3.40, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $5.08. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.1% per annum over that time. While the consistency in the dividend payments is impressive, we think the relatively slow rate of growth is less attractive.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings have grown at around 4.6% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. So the company has struggled to grow its EPS yet it's still paying out 98% of its earnings. Limited recent earnings growth and a high payout ratio makes it hard for us to envision strong future dividend growth, unless the company should have substantial pricing power or some form of competitive advantage.Story continuesPhilip Morris International's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, this is probably not a great income stock, even though the dividend is being raised at the moment. In the past the payments have been stable, but we think the company is paying out too much for this to continue for the long term. We don't think Philip Morris International is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

18,5ebcccbe-90ea-3228-a759-ab7fb2ecb667,GS,2023-09-17,Goldman Sachs Group's (NYSE:GS) three-year earnings growth trails the notable shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-groups-nyse-gs-120240843.html,1694865760,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) share price is up 76% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 26% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 8.2% , including dividends .On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Goldman Sachs Group was able to grow its EPS at 21% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. Notably, the 21% average annual share price gain matches up nicely with the EPS growth rate. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Goldman Sachs Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Goldman Sachs Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 89%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveGoldman Sachs Group shareholders are up 8.2% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 10% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Goldman Sachs Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

19,6abfc03e-4649-3ebf-99ce-5d32c49046f7,PKG,2023-09-17,Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/packaging-corporation-america-nyse-pkg-121015344.html,1694952615,STORY,['PKG'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Packaging Corporation of America (NYSE:PKG) is about to go ex-dividend in just 4 days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Packaging Corporation of America's shares on or after the 22nd of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.25 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$5.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Packaging Corporation of America stock has a trailing yield of around 3.3% on the current share price of $149.75. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Packaging Corporation of America paid out 53% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Packaging Corporation of America generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 55% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.Story continuesIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. This is why it's a relief to see Packaging Corporation of America earnings per share are up 6.3% per annum over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Packaging Corporation of America has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Packaging Corporation of America has delivered 17% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpIs Packaging Corporation of America worth buying for its dividend? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and Packaging Corporation of America paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. Overall, it's hard to get excited about Packaging Corporation of America from a dividend perspective.If you want to look further into Packaging Corporation of America, it's worth knowing the risks this business faces. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Packaging Corporation of America you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Of the nine, only Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) is down year-to-date, and it’s off by more than 57%. So, there’s something to following the pros’ recommendations.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA quick Finviz.com screen of S&amp;P 500 stocks tells me that there are 63 with an average analyst recommendation of less than 2.0. Lower is better in this situation. The worst score is 3.5. There are two stocks in this lowly category. Approximately 387 are between 2.0 and 3.0, with 53 above 3.0. The companies I’m after are those in the group of 63.  To make things interesting, I’ll select from three different sectors and select three different share price categories:  one below $100, one above $500 and one in between, with a median target price at least 5% higher than the share price. TJX Companies (TJX)An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the consumer discretionary sector, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) has a recommendation rating of 1.80 and a share price under $100. The company’s share price jumped by more than 4% in mid-August after reporting results that were much better than expected. On the top line, its revenue was $12.76 billion, $310 million higher than analyst expectations, while on the bottom line, it earned 85 cents a share, eight cents above the consensus estimate.Despite it rarely delivering massive annual gains, TJX is one of those stocks analysts love as it provides enough meat on the bone for investors to keep coming back over the long haul. YTD, it’s up nearly 16% and 39% over the past year. After the discount retailer reported its Q2 2023 results, Barron’s reported that Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih was very complimentary about its business:Story continues“’TJX’s report is a testament to the strength of the Off-Price model in a consumer slowing backdrop,’ wrote Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih in a note to clients. ‘Inventory remains plentiful in quality and quantity, and consumers’ pressured wallets are seeking value via the Off-Price channel.'”There is no question that TJX’s off-price business model is an enduring one that will continue to generate profitable growth.Of the 25 analysts that cover its stock, 19 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a $99 median target price.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the financial sector, S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a recommendation rating of 1.70, according to Finviz.com, and a share price between $100 and $500.The company best-known for its S&amp;P Indices business is having a decent year in the markets. It’s up more than 17% YTD, about 103 basis points ahead of the index. Of the 23 analysts that cover its stock, 21 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy, with a median target price of $450.50, 14% higher than its current share price. The last time I called on SPGI was in July. The financial stock was one of three names that analysts generally liked. Nothing’s changed in that regard. Well, not entirely. S&amp;P Global reported its Q2 2023 results a week after my July article. They were decent if not a thing of beauty. Revenues rose 3% on an adjusted basis to $3.1 billion, while its operating income was $1.43 billion, 2% higher than Q2 2022. At the midpoint of its guidance, the company expects revenues to grow 5% in 2023, with earnings per share of $12.45. That’s 11% higher than in 2022.  By hook or by crook, CEO Doug Peterson will continue to grow S&amp;P Global profitably.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the tech sector, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has a recommendation rating of 1.80 and a share price over $500. The company’s share price jumped by more than 4% in mid-August after reporting results that were much better than expected. On September 6, Intuit launched its first artificial intelligence (AI) product, Intuit Assist. It is part of CEO Sasan Goodarzi’s $20-billion bet on AI and big data that he made almost the day he became the company’s chief executive in 2019. Fortune’s Geoff Colvin recently reported that Goodrarzi said: “At the end of the day, there are certain decisions you have to make. And the decision I made was, as a team, we’re going to bet the company on data and AI.”Between TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mailchimp, Intuit has a treasure trove of data from more than 177 million customers. Good data is critical to good AI. That puts Intuit heads above anyone else when rolling out AI-focused financial apps. While the decisions made by Goodarzi back in 2019 involved risk, the CEO considers not taking action would have been equally risky:“We are at the beginning of the journey with AI,” Goodarzi told Fortune. “In the next five to 10 years it will create new economies and destroy some economies, will create new experiences, fuel new company growth and make certain companies go out of business.”In fiscal 2024 (July year-end), Intuit expects to grow its revenues and earnings by double digits, hence why it’s one of the stocks analysts love. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long Term Returns of Paul Singer's 5 Activist Targets.Paul Singer is the brain behind Elliot Management, one of the oldest hedge funds with over $50 billion in assets under management. The hedge fund started investing in convertible bonds and arbitrage before branching into distressed investing.A change of focus into activism is what has propelled the hedge fund to great heights, making Singer one of the most feared and respected in corporate America. Last year alone, the hedge fund is believed to have gained 5.9% as the overall market turned bearish and the S&amp;P 500 fell 19%. The impressive performance stems from Singer's aggressive investment strategies that tend to outperform the overall market.Having started Elliot management in 1977, Singer has been consistently successful thanks to his focus on underperforming companies, where he pushes for changes to improve their performance and value. His average annual return of 14% explains why he is one of the revered hedge fund managers. He has embedded his name on Wall Street as a successful activist investor who takes stakes in struggling businesses and pushes for changes, hoping to lift their share price and fat returns.Born and raised in New Jersey, Singer is credited as one of the people who accurately predicted the financial crisis of 2008. Even as the market was downturned, the activist investor made a fortune from credit default swaps that bet on leveraged companies.Long Term Returns of Paul Singer's Activist TargetsPaul Singer of Elliott ManagementThe Wall Street titan is best remembered for warring with the Argentinian government in a 15-year legal campaign over lapsed debt payments. The result was the seizure of an Argentinian ship. The matter was settled in Elliot receiving a payout of $2.4 billion even as other bondholders settled for pennies. The settlement underscores Elliot Management as one of Wall Street's most feared funds.Story continuesSinger has carried out successful activist plays on Wall Street, with the most recent including Twitter, AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Samsung. The activist investor has also made a multi-million dollar investment in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), joining Starboard Value, another activist investor who insists the software company is suffering from a valuation discount. In addition to activism, Singer is also active in buyouts, distressed debt, real estate, and commodities.Our Methodology We have compiled some of the biggest activist campaigns initiated by Paul Singer's hedge fund over the past few years and compared the stock performance of these targets of Singer with the returns with the S&amp;P 500.Long-Term Returns of Paul Singer's Activist Targets13.

It operates in three segments: Media, Data, and engagement Solutions, Integrated Advertising and Creativity Led Solutions, and Specialized Communications and experiential Solutions.Elliott Management first targeted the company in 2014 by confirming a 6.7% stake and started agitating for the sale of the business to one of its competitors. However, no deal ever materialized. In 2015, Elliott was awarded two board seats to avert a potential proxy fight, and the company agreed to return $2.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.By 2017, Elliott Management had exited its position in The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

A push to sell one of the company's power generation units was one of the options considered by the investor.The drive for this move followed Alcoa Corporation's (NYSE: AA) announcement of its intention to divide into two publicly traded companies. Elliott was supportive of the management push to spinoff, insisting it was engaged in friendly dialogue.Elliot Management boosted its stake in the company to 7.4% in 2016  in anticipation of its split.

(NYSE:TSN) will pay a dividend of $0.48 on the 15th of December. This means the annual payment is 3.5% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods Tyson Foods' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Prior to this announcement, Tyson Foods' dividend was only 48% of earnings, however it was paying out 697% of free cash flows. While the company may be more focused on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business at this time, we think that a cash payout ratio this high might expose the dividend to being cut if the business ran into some challenges.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 36%, so there isn't too much pressure on the dividend.historic-dividendTyson Foods Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.20 total annually to $1.92. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 25% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Tyson Foods' EPS has fallen by approximately 34% per year during the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Story continuesIn SummaryIn summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Tyson Foods' payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Tyson Foods is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For instance, we've picked out 4 warning signs for Tyson Foods that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

A fundamental tenet of either a business or a financial education is the concept of diversification. On the business or managerial side of things, diversification refers to expanding a firm's product or market portfolio to create multiple revenue streams that are spread across different geographies. Most of the world's biggest companies, such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) try to follow this approach, and Apple in particular benefited from diversification in its latest quarter as while its revenue from the iPhone was disappointing, its Services segment continued to perform well.On the financial side, diversification refers to spreading out an investment portfolio across different sectors. It follows the age old principle of ""don't put all your eggs in one basket"" and one way in which professional investors diversify their investments is through what is called an Efficient Frontier. This involves plotting a portfolio's measure of risk (i.e. its Standard Deviation) and its expected returns on a graph and then comparing multiple portfolios to see which is riskier, which offers more return, and which is a perfect balance of the two.However, while portfolio planning is a rather tedious process that requires mathematical grunt work, there are other ways in which a regular investor can try their hand at diversification. One such strategy it to turn outwards and take a look at the global corporate landscape. After all, there are stock markets all over the world, and while investing in say, the Taiwanese Stock Exchange (TWSE) might be a bit complicated, there is a way to grow foreign exposure in an investment portfolio by buying stocks listed on U.S. exchanges such as the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Story continuesThis can be done through buying what are typically referred to in the financial world as American Depository Receipts (ADRs). An ADR is issued by a bank operating in America, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM). So let's say JPMorgan owns 1000 shares of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) in Taiwan. TSMC's shares are traded as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TPE:2330.TW) in Taiwan. The bank can decide that since TSMC is one of the largest and most advanced chip manufacturing companies in the world, there is considerable demand for its shares in the U.S. So, JPMorgan can decide to issue ADRs that trade in the U.S., which represent one full unit, less, or more of TSMC's shares that are traded in Taiwan. Of course, a firm can also issue its own ADRs which are called sponsored ADRs.Additionally, while diversification is good, the main question on anyone's mind when investing is whether the money being spent is worth it and can grow in the future. On this front, data from BlackRock sheds more light on the benefits and drawbacks of investing in foreign companies. Analyzing data between 1972 and 2022, the investment firm first shows that for the decade that ended in 2022, international stocks outperformed U.S. stocks in only two of these years, namely 2017 and 2022. However, over the course of the five decades, international stocks delivered superior performance for nearly half of the time period, and a deeper look at the data shows that their out performance increases when the American stock market is under stress. For instance, BlackRock analyzes Morningstar's data to study two time periods. The first is where U.S. stock returns were less than 4% and the second is where the returns were less than 6%. For the former, international stocks saw superior returns in all 45 of the time periods being analyzed, while in the latter, they outperformed 96% of the time or in 54 out of the 56 time periods being studied.This would suggest that it's prudent to focus on international firms when domestic stocks in America are not performing well. However, while this would appear to be a sound principle to follow on the surface, the fact still remains that an investing decision involves taking a clear eyed approach to a multitude of factors to ensure that there aren't any surprises. Currently, both Europe and China, two of the world's biggest economic regions after the United States, are not performing well. Chinese under performance in particular has created quite a bit of turmoil in global markets recently, as it is one of the reasons behind a recent unsavory oil production cut by Saudi Arabia. This cut has pushed oil prices back to multi month high levels, and generated even more uncertainty about the ability of central banks to curtail inflation by raising interest rates.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some top ADR stocks, with some notable picks being Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), Linde plc (NYSE:LIN), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM).10 Best ADR Stocks To Buy NowPixabay/Public domainOur Methodology To compile our list of the best ADR stocks to buy, we first made a list of the 20 biggest firms with ADRs based on their market capitalization.

This move comes in the wake of the company's decision to reduce its workforce by 10% earlier this year. DoorDash (DASH) trends lower after MoffettNathanson analysts downgraded the stock from an ""Outperform"" rating to ""Market Perform."" This news comes ahead of the company's plans to re-list its stock on the NASDAQ (^IXIC) on Sept. 27th. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares slip after reportedly telling suppliers to expect postponed deliveries due to a lack of demand.Yahoo Finance Live's Brad Smith and Akiko Fujita break down the top stocks of the day.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Salesforce, down nearly 2% today. Bloomberg reporting the cloud-based software firm is hiring 3,300 people across various departments-- a change of tone from the company. Earlier this year, remember they eliminated 10% of its workforce.And, Brad, as soon as I saw this thinking back to the conversations that our very own Brian Sozzi had out at Dreamforce, how many times did he talk about those boomerang employees-- those employees that were maybe laid off earlier on the year, maybe left the company last year-- Salesforce really making an effort to try and bring those employees back largely because they see opportunities in huge expansion. AI certainly a big one, but they've also talked about sales, engineering.So Salesforce sees a lot of opportunities there. Interesting stock move, although we've often seen the hiring correlated with a leg down in terms of the stock because of the costs associated with that.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. With some of the major ambitions that they laid out at Dreamforce this week, that as you mentioned our own executive editor Brian Sozzi was hearing directly from, if you will, the horse's mouth.But we'll be more kind and generous and say the genius the, leader that is Marc Benioff as well, the CEO of Salesforce, as well as some of the CEOs of subsidiaries within there at Slack, particularly when Slack came up in the conversation in the chat as one of the leading plays that Salesforce would have in AI. They said that Slack would really lead that charge among some of their tools and application services that they offer out to their portfolio clients.Story continuesBut for where Salesforce is also going to look to expand here, it's in partnerships. They're expanding through a partnership that they already have with Google to deliver this new era that they're calling a business productivity powered by generative AI.So a larger kind of indication of where we've already seen some of the mega-cap tech companies decide how they're going to carve out their space through partnerships to maintain their own kind of market share, even as this new wave of generative AI investments has accelerated, had lighter fluid essentially pouring on it over the past several quarters here and especially over the course of this year.AKIKO FUJITA: All right. Let's move on to another soccer watching. DoorDash seeing-- let's see where the stock ended. There you go. Down about 2.5%. So MoffettNathanson analyst downgrading DoorDash from outperform to market perform, citing the return of student loan payments to take a bite out of their revenue. A number-- DoorDash also announcing it's transferring its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the NASDAQ. They will officially make the move on September 27.Brad, worth noting some numbers in this report. The average student loan consumer is about to experience a 14% to 19% hit to discretionary spending. And, of course, you know, DoorDash isn't the only company that's going to get hit. We've heard the impact from student loan repayments from other companies throughout earnings calls. But this line here. What happens when 43 million Americans see an average of $225 a month come out of their pockets in October? This is from that MoffettNathanson report.Well, there's no such thing as a free lunch, right? And when you think about the user base for DoorDash, monthly active users aged 25 to 44, 65% of those users fall within that age group. And those are likely to take the biggest hit when those student loan repayments resume in October.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. So layer on that DoorDash usership figure that you mentioned there and the demographic that they go after and the core user base that really accounts for much of the activity with this federal data that the analysts also had layered in here. People aged 24 to 49 hold 69% of the nation's student loan debt.So you kind combine these two things together and it really spells out a discretionary food spending storm that is brewing at this point in time and is set to hit the coast of DoorDash and perhaps some of the other delivery businesses here. We're looking at Uber we're looking, of course, across the broader spectrum of these services that have really, really made sure that they can continue to attract mindshare on not just the convenience factor, but also making sure that they're growing out the amount of merchants that they work with as well.So the amount of cuisines, the amount of large national partnerships that they're able to bring on. That's something that they've used as a selling point, but what now? And so we'll see exactly how that effects in terms of the student loan repayments-- the number of people that are hop skipping jumping or just kind of loading up the app as I do when I get bored and also just when I'm lazy and don't want to--AKIKO FUJITA: I just ordered my lunch from DoorDash today.BRAD SMITH: Did you? OK.AKIKO FUJITA: I did. I did--Oh, there's some recs.AKIKO FUJITA: --for the showBRAD SMITH: All right. Let's talk about Taiwan Semiconductor here as well. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ends the day down by 2.4%. This is the world's largest third-party semiconductor manufacturer, telling its major suppliers to delay deliveries amid slowing demand. That's according to a Reuters report here. This comes just a week after the company said its August revenue fell 13.5% from last year.Just briefly as well here, according to the report companies affected by the instruction to delay supplier shipments into Taiwan Semiconductor, it includes ASML-- that's the lithography equipment that is necessary for some of the chipmaking-- the high-end chipmaking according to sources within this story as well.AKIKO FUJITA: So it wasn't just TSMC hit by this today. A number of their other competitors as well, that those stocks moving a leg lower. But I think it's kind of interesting that the contrast with what we're hearing from Wall Street analysts in terms of what this all means. Citi's analysts saying this is no new news. They said any pullback in the chip equipment subsector or the sector would be a buying opportunity.You had Jefferies analysts saying that they still have some of these chipmakers, chip equipment suppliers as well as their top picks. So while we are seeing that pullback today, certainly the long-term investment case, at least among some Wall Street analysts, appear to be holding steady.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, great point there.]"

New cars made today can have as many as 3,000 chips per vehicle, meaning a long battle between major automakers and the UAW union could eventually start to weigh on production and chip suppliers.Texas Instruments (TXN) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are among the largest auto chip manufacturers in the world, while TSMC (TSM) is the leading contract chip manufacturer. Shares of all three chipmakers moved lower on Friday.And more chipmakers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Micron (MU) could see effects over time too, as both have substantial connected car businesses. Qualcomm has doubled down on its auto business in recent years, while Micron is often discussed as the market leader when it comes to auto memory chips.The impact on these companies varies based on a few factors, including the length of the strike and each company's exposure to automakers. The UAW has opted for a ""stand up"" strike, in which workers walk out at select GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants rather than all at once, in order to prolong the action and the union's $825 million strike fund.In 2022, 52% of NXP's total revenue came from its automotive chips, according to Counterpoint Research, while Texas Instruments derived 25% of its total revenue from the industry, company reports showed. At the same time, TSMC reported that its automotive segment accounted for just 5% of its total revenue.Estimated cost of the UAW labor strike.Diversification is key when it comes to suppliers' resilience in these circumstances, Anderson Economic Group COO Tyler Theile told Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday (video above). Overall, Theile said, a 10-day UAW strike could have an impact of over $5 billion in the US alone, with broader impacts globally.Story continuesThe 2019 GM strike that lasted 42 days offers clues as to what might happen.""In 2019, we saw suppliers that were 90% or more focused on supplying to GM have to shut down and completely lay off all of their workers for a number of days,"" Theile said. ""If you're a supplier that's more diversified among several OEMs, maybe you're not as impacted as quickly or as strongly.""There could be far-ranging effects on the economy broadly — but it will have to be a pretty extreme situation to get there.""In 2019, if you look at the seasonally adjusted data, the strike did push Michigan in the United States into a single-state, single-quarter recession,"" Theile said. ""So it would take a lot for this to hit, for example, multiple states or the US data and important economic indicators, like GDP, as a whole, but it's not out of the question if a quite lengthy strike is sustained.""GM workers with the UAW Local 2250 Union strike outside the General Motors Wentzville Assembly Plant on Sept. 15, 2023, in Wentzville, Mo. (Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)However, not all tech companies are set to be negatively affected down the supply chain amid a strike. Tesla (TSLA) is set to be a winner, especially if the strike proves lengthy.""Non-union Tesla does not face similar issues which speaks to the complexity both GM and Ford face going up against the EV leader Tesla while trying to satisfy rising union demands,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Sept. 14. ""If a strike happens (and is lengthy) then ultimately production and the EV roadmap could be pushed out into 2024 and delays would be on the horizon at this crucial period for GM, Ford, and Stellantis.""""We believe a strike lasting longer than 4 weeks would be a body blow to the EV ambitions of GM and Ford in 1H24 and delay many aspects of this initial important EV push,"" Ives added.Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Specifically, robotics stocks remain overlooked by many investors, even as the need for automation and robotics solutions continues to accelerate. Labor shortages and cost pressures are driving more companies to seek ways to automate repetitive or dangerous jobs traditionally done by human workers.Blue-collar industries stand to be massively impacted by advancements in robotics, perhaps even more so than white-collar industries. For this reason, now may be an opportune time for forward-looking investors to start building positions in leading robotics companies. In this article, I’ll highlight seven of the most promising robotics stocks that are poised to benefit from the increasing adoption of automation and robotics. Although some of the leading tech giants have seen their share prices balloon thanks to the recent AI rally, many specialized robotics players still offer significant upside potential. Here are three for investors to add to their watch lists right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRockwell Automation (ROK)Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockIndustrial stalwart Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) has seen its shares dip around 12% from its July peak, creating an attractive chance to grab shares of this robotics leader.With automation demand still red hot, Rockwell Automation looks poised to continue delivering healthy growth. Consensus analyst estimates call for around 15% sales growth this year. That’s not shabby at all for an industrial firm.Beyond the company’s headline financials, Rockwell saw some moderation in customer orders last quarter as supply chain constraints eased and lead times normalized. However, management reiterated that underlying demand remains robust. The company’s diverse end-market exposure and innovative new offerings increase my confidence that temporary order swings won’t derail its long-term prospects.Story continuesWith unemployment still at record lows, workforce shortages will compel companies to boost investment in automation for years to come. Rockwell’s expanded software capabilities, including cloud-native options, provide plenty of growth potential.In my opinion, ROK stock looks like a smart bet for investors seeking robotics exposure without the heartburn of some pricier, fast-moving tech names.Littelfuse (LFUS)a robot built in the essence of a human raising its hand to its chin implying deep thoughtSource: Phonlamai Photo / Shutterstock.comMeanwhile, electronic components maker Littelfuse (NASDAQ:LFUS) offers investors a lower-risk way to gain robotics exposure. This is another under-the-radar stock, but one that won’t generate some wild price swings like some pure-play robotics innovators. Indeed, that’s precisely why I think many investors should take a look at this company.Littelfuse brings a track record of consistent execution and financial performance. Despite some recent red ink, the future looks bright for LFUS stock. Consensus forecasts call for 5.7% sales growth in 2024 after its 5.24% decline this year. This revenue growth should drive a nice recovery in earnings per share, which are projected to climb 13% after a 28.5% fall this year. The following year, in 2025, analysts see an acceleration on both metrics, with sales growth rebounding to 10.6% and earnings per share expected to surge 24% higher. Thus, I see a lot of appreciation ahead.Plus, LFUS is trading at a forward price-earnings ratio below 20-times for that growth, and serving up a 1% dividend yield as a sweetener. As supply chain constraints continue to ease over the next year, I believe this is a stock that will see more positive price action.Hyundai Motor Company (HYMTF)Hyundai (HYMTF) sign for car dealership with blue sky in background, symbolizing HYMTF stockSource: shutterstock.com/AntonovVitaliiSouth Korean auto titan Hyundai Motor (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) isn’t the first name that pops to mind when considering robotics stocks. Hyundai spreads its bets across vehicles, construction equipment, and financial services, but it also boasts a thriving robotics subsidiary in Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics’ remarkable four-legged Spot robot has certainly fascinated many investors.Accordingly, with HYMTF stock hovering below $50 apiece, I believe investors are getting the firm’s budding robotics capabilities at a bargain. Not to mention, its bread-and-butter auto business still looks relatively healthy.Hyundai has provided stellar growth numbers this year, with Q1 sales up 13% and operating profit margin more than doubling. The key drivers? Strong SUV and luxury Genesis vehicle sales, along with rising EV volumes. Again, this not really a direct robotics play, but as EVs become more autonomous, I feel like Hyundai deserves a spot in this article. Plus, the stock provides some appealing exposure to both EV and AI macro trends.IPG Photonics (IPGP)a worker with a tablet remotely operates a standalone robot arm. Get Rich with Robotics. Best Robotics Stocks to BuySource: ShutterstockWhile I don’t dispute the challenging operating environment, laser maker IPG Photonics’ (NASDAQ:IPGP) massive underperformance this summer may have created a bottom fishing opportunity for value investors.The stock is down around 24% since its July peak as sales declined across several key geographies and applications. But with shares beaten down 30% from where the stock traded five years ago, I believe the negativity around IPGP looks overdone.Make no mistake, IPGP faces headwinds from weakening manufacturing activity, especially in Europe and China. However, management emphasized that key demand drivers like EVs and renewables remain resilient.Looking ahead, the company’s growth outlook appears brighter. Analysts expect the current downtrend to prove temporary, forecasting a 6.4% sales decline for 2023 but a return to 11% growth in 2023 and a further 13% pop in 2024. Earnings per share tell a similar recovery story, with the company’s EPS figure anticipated to rebound from $4.80 this year to $6.50 in 2025.Despite divergent opinions on Wall Street, most analysts see upside from the current price level. I believe the latest pullback makes IPG’s valuation much more reasonable for investors seeking rock-bottom value picks. For those with a higher risk appetite, I think starting a position at current levels makes sense.Teledyne Technologies (TDY)robotic arms over medical bed symbolizing medical roboticsSource: shutterstock.com/MAD.vertiseTeledyne Technologies (NYSE:TDY) has been rangebound over the past couple of years, trading just 6% above pre-pandemic levels. This is despite stellar sales growth of over 85% from pre-COVID levels, proving the industrial conglomerate’s resilience amidst economic uncertainty.The company continues to deliver consistent top-line expansion, with revenues expected to grow around 5% annually over the next two years. This has led to a relatively higher valuation, with the company’s forward price-to-earnings multiple on the pricier side. I believe paying the premium for TDY stock is worth it, considering its historical performance, as well as its hand in the drone industry.The average Wall Street analyst has a $500 price target with this stock, implying almost 20% upside. As I’ve mentioned before with companies like Ammo Inc., a higher share price is likely since Teledyne inked some deals to send counter UAS systems to Ukraine for $31 million. That money is going to keep flowing in, and investors will be rewarded.Fanuc (FANUY)3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Should ConsiderSource: ShutterstockFanuc (OTCMKTS:FANUY) has plunged over 30% since its June peak, recently finding support around $13. That’s the same level that marked a bottom back in October, before a 30%+ rally ensued. The Japanese robotics and automation leader faces macro uncertainty. However, double-digit sales growth is still expected over the next two years.Demand trends should normalize in 2023, and despite the company’s near-term headwinds, Fanuc maintains dominant market share in its niche areas like factory automation and CNC machines. Its current valuation reflects an excessively bearish outlook.For long-term investors, this likely represents another golden buying opportunity. Some volatility may persist given the demand environment, but the risk-reward skews positively at current levels. Patient accumulators stand to be rewarded handsomely if Fanuc’s growth returns as expected.Hexagon (HXGBY)Miso Robotics 'ROAR' technology displayed on computer monitor.Source: Miso RoboticsSweden’s Hexagon (OTCMKTS:HXGBY) has plunged back toward 2018 lows, revisiting levels last seen before its pandemic surge. The company holds leadership positions in secular growth areas like metrology and geospatial imaging. Analysts expect the company’s sales growth to creep up to 14% in 2026 from just 4% this year, reflecting these strong market positions. At current levels, HXGBY stock trades at just 24-times forward earnings.Drilling down further, Hexagon’s manufacturing and infrastructure arms both faced particular weakness recently pressuring results. However, management expects positive inflections in these cyclical end-markets moving forward. The company also continues investing in growth initiatives like autonomous technology, and many expect this investment to bear fruit down the road. Margin expansion remains a key priority, with a new efficiency program aimed at boosting profitability.The average analyst puts the one-year upside potential at 28%.

They include all-electric companions to its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, according to researcher GlobalData.GM has been struggling much of the year to smooth out hiccups in battery manufacturing as well as its EV supply chain and logistics, including delivery to dealers of its Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer EVs.The company delivered just 1,348 Lyriqs and 47 Hummers in the second quarter, far below expectations, in part because of issues with battery module assembly.Chief Executive Mary Barra in July told analysts: ""Our automation equipment supplier is struggling with delivery issues,"" causing a bottleneck that had forced the automaker to assemble battery modules by hand.In July, GM executive Rory Harvey said the company was working out delivery issues to dealers, noting that Lyriq and Hummer ""have been going down the line in very limited quantities (but) we are building momentum.""A longer strike could help GM address and potentially resolve some of those ongoing issues in its EV and battery operations, according to Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.""A production stoppage could allow GM to solve bottlenecks,” Fiorani said.The automaker has not been able to roll out its most important EVs in a timely fashion, but could benefit if it used the labor stoppage to resolve some of its technical and operational issues, he said.""GM could ramp up output faster once the factories start running again,"" said Fiorani.Story continues'POTENTIAL NIGHTMARE'Other analysts say the stoppage is unlikely to work out in GM's favor. GM's Barra herself said the strike ""would not be positive"" for the company and that it needed to reach a deal with workers quickly.""For GM, a possible byproduct of an extended strike may be more time to work out any kinks they are having with their EV launches, but the potential loss of billions of dollars in the process would make it hard to justify such a 'silver lining,'"" said Bill Rinna, GlobalData’s director of Americas vehicle forecasts.Wedbush auto analyst Daniel Ives said the strike was ""a potential nightmare situation"" for GM given it comes exactly at a key period of ironing out EV issues.""In this crucial period of EV execution, model roll-outs, distribution, marketing, with EV competition rising across the board, the timing could not be worse,"" Ives said in a research note.In addition, the UAW strike in the United States could affect the flow of critical auto parts to GM operations in Canada and Mexico, which would hamper EV production there, Rinna said.GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico has begun building the Chevrolet Blazer EV and is adding production of the Chevrolet Equinox EV, while its Ingersoll plant in Canada is planning to produce the BrightDrop Zevo 400 electric delivery van, according to GlobalData.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit, editing by Deepa Babington)]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the African business environment and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then check out 5 Best African Stocks To Invest In. Africa is one of the largest continents in the world both in terms of its size and its population. However, despite this, decades of colonialism and an inability to achieve lasting peace in the region have also left it among the most impoverished as well. Africa's gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita) is $2,151 if we assume that the continent's GDP is worth $2.9 trillion and its population is 1.39 billion. This implies that an average African earns roughly the equivalent of the monthly rent of an apartment in an American city in an entire year. Additionally, this is the average figure, which is naturally controverted by the fact that the largest African nations in terms of GDP contribute the most to the GDP so the smallest nations often have a couple of hundred dollars as their GDP per capita.However, as any astute businessperson and investor is likely to remind you, where there's underdevelopment, there's opportunity. After all, while a vast number of Americans enjoy basic services such as healthcare and medicines, populations in Africa don't. Therefore, for the sharp business people, the under served population in the country offers potential for new business and market growth.One of the biggest attracting factors for Africa is the continent's expected population growth. Estimates suggest that Africa's population is slated to touch 1.1 billion by 2040, making it one of the largest work forces in the world. More people of working age means that the demand for products such as cars and houses will also rise, not to mention healthcare and discretionary products and services such as travel services and apparel. Naturally, this creates a large market and underscores the potential for investment in the continent. This also means that while traditional investments in Africa have focused on the natural resources and mining sectors (with several firms on our list being such companies) recently, the trend is shifting to also focus on other industries such as telecommunications.Story continuesAt the same time, trade within African countries isn't where analysts would like it to be. According to data from McKinsey, only 10% of Africa's imports and 17% of its exports are within the continent. These figures are lower than in other developing regions such as Asia and Latin America, with the percentage of imports and exports underscoring the potential for African businesses to trade with countries within the continent. The underdeveloped nature of the continent also means that its cities are growing too fast, which creates fears that the supporting infrastructure for millions of people who live in these cities might not develop as fast as their population is growing. On a positive note for African businesses and even international companies that seek to develop a foothold in the continent, the region is also estimated to have the world's youngest population by 2050, opening up the doors to vast amounts of spending power should these people be able to secure gainful employment.As if a rapidly growing population and a potentially vibrant workforce weren't enough, Africa is also home to vast amounts of natural resources. Estimates from the United Nations show that 30% of the world's minerals, 12% of oil, and 8% of natural gas resources are in Africa alone. The continent is a literal gold mine too, as it holds 40% of global gold reserves and an astounding 90% of all the platinum reserves in the world. Summing it up, not only does Africa stand to gain from rapid population growth, but it can further expand its share of the global commodity food pie by exporting the valuable products and earning foreign exchange.However, the continent is not immune to the events that have shaped the global economy since the 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. While we had estimated Africa's per capita income to sit above $2,000 at the start of the piece, data from Bloomberg shows that as of 2023, Africa's per capita income is $1,710. This is a worrying figure since it marks a drop from the $1,824 reading in 2011 and shows that the region has lost a decade of economic prosperity. The drop also becomes more resounding when we consider the fact that per capita income had been consistently growing since 2002. The pandemic was particularly hard on the continent as it saw the figure drop to $1,488 in 2022 - lower than the levels it was in 2008 - another time of crisis in the global economy. 2023 has already seen a military coup in Africa as well, and political instability is the continent's hallmark as you'll find out if you read 30 Most Unstable Countries in the World.But what about African companies? Today we'll look at some top ones that are seeing interest from hedge funds and the notable names are Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Kosmos Energy Ltd. (NYSE:KOS), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts Genuine Parts' Improving ProfitsOver the last three years, Genuine Parts has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. Genuine Parts' EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$7.76 to US$8.64. That's a 11% gain; respectable growth in the broader scheme of things.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. EBIT margins for Genuine Parts remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 12% to US$23b. That's encouraging news for the company!In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Genuine Parts.Are Genuine Parts Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. This view is based on the possibility that stock purchases signal bullishness on behalf of the buyer. However, insiders are sometimes wrong, and we don't know the exact thinking behind their acquisitions.Shareholders in Genuine Parts will be more than happy to see insiders committing themselves to the company, spending US$628k on shares in just twelve months. This, combined with the lack of sales from insiders, should be a great signal for shareholders in what's to come. It is also worth noting that it was Independent Director Robert Loudermilk who made the biggest single purchase, worth US$304k, paying US$152 per share.On top of the insider buying, it's good to see that Genuine Parts insiders have a valuable investment in the business. Holding US$65m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Shareholders have more to smile about than just insiders adding more shares to their already sizeable holdings. That's because Genuine Parts' CEO, Paul Donahue, is paid at a relatively modest level when compared to other CEOs for companies of this size. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Genuine Parts, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.The Genuine Parts CEO received US$10m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.Should You Add Genuine Parts To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Genuine Parts is that it is growing profits. On top of that, we've seen insiders buying shares even though they already own plenty. That should do plenty in prompting budding investors to undertake a bit more research - or even adding the company to their watchlists. Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Genuine Parts  that you should be aware of.Keen growth investors love to see insider buying. Thankfully, Genuine Parts isn't the only one.

Allen Media Group did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request.In a statement, Disney said, ""While we are open to considering a variety of strategic options for our linear businesses, at this time The Walt Disney Company has made no decision with respect to the divestiture of ABC or any other property and any report to that effect is unfounded.""The reports come after Disney and Charter reached a precedent-setting agreement on Monday following a contract dispute that led Disney to pull its owned and operated channels, including ESPN and ABC, off Charter Spectrum cable systems in late August.As part of the deal, Charter will offer some Disney streaming services — the ad-supported version of Disney+, ESPN+, and ESPN's yet-to-be-launched direct-to-consumer offering — for select cable packages at no additional cost to the consumer.Linear TV 'past the point of no return'Disney resolved its high-profile dispute with cable giant Charter earlier this week — but the company's linear future still remains unclear. (Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The Charter dispute had raised questions about the future of the traditional cable TV bundle, especially as more consumers drop their cable packages in a trend known as cord-cutting and instead opt for streaming services that are less profitable for media companies.According to recent data from Nielsen, linear TV viewership fell below 50% in July for the first time. Broadcast and cable each hit a new low of 20% and 29.6% of total TV usage, respectively, to combine for a linear television total of 49.6%.Story continuesTime spent streaming (via a television) increased 2.9% in July compared with June, according to the data, to reach a record of 38.7% of total TV usage.""Linear TV [is] past the point of no return,"" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note just ahead of the data's release. He added the revenue line for cable and satellite operators is ""probably permanently negative"" as pricing fails to drive upside and TV advertising growth stalls.Amid those declines, Disney CEO Bob Iger said he would take an ""expansive"" look at the entertainment giant's traditional TV assets, which includes broadcast network ABC and cable channels FX, Freeform, and National Geographic — signaling the potential for a sale.""We are expansive in our thinking about [the linear business], and we're going to look expansively ... [for] opportunities there because, clearly, it's a business that's going to continue to struggle,"" the executive said in an interview with CNBC in July.The executive added the current distribution model is ""definitely broken,"" saying the linear TV assets ""may not be core"" to Disney's strategy any longer.It's a challenge that fellow legacy media companies have also faced with Comcast's NBC (CMCSA), Paramount's CBS (PARA), and Fox Corporation's Fox network (FOXA) all feeling the pressure as TV advertising woes mount.""The television advertising sector is experiencing what might feel like an existential crisis at the moment,"" Brian Wieser, principal at insights provider Madison and Wall, said in a new note released earlier this month.""At the start of this year, we had a situation where cord-cutting was accelerating into high-single-digit levels of decline, enabled (if not outright encouraged) by traditional TV network owners’ shift of resources and programming budgets into streaming platforms, which have been and are likely to always be ad-free or ad-light at best,"" he continued, adding the Hollywood strikes have also added an extra layer of impact.Investors have also seemed to put their weight behind streaming services as the market cap of Netflix (NFLX), currently hovering above $175 billion, roughly equals the market caps of Disney, Fox, and Paramount combined.'Who wants to buy a linear TV business?'Still, networks continue to earn double-digit margins as sports viewership remains a big driver behind cable bundle subscriptions.Tom Carter, Nexstar’s former COO who became a senior adviser at the company in August, said at Bank of America's Media, Communications, and Entertainment Conference on Wednesday that the company would be interested in ""opportunities"" to acquire linear assets from legacy media giants, including Disney.Still, he warned a sale would likely be complicated, especially if ESPN is not included in a potential spin-off.""A lot of those assets, the linear and the [direct-to-consumer] assets are intertwined,"" he said. ""From a programming perspective and from a content perspective, you're seeing ESPN simulcast the majority of their large sporting events on ABC. If you were to buy the ABC complex, how would that work going forward? So there's a lot of questions that need to be answered there.""Bob Iger attends the Los Angeles Special Screening of Searchlight Pictures' ""Flamin' Hot"" at Hollywood Post 43 - American Legion on June 9, 2023 in Hollywood, Calif. (Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)Analysts have questioned the strength of a potential buyer for Disney's TV channels given the intense secular declines in linear television networks.""Every media company is facing cord-cutting, shifts of television advertising to connected TVs and other platforms,"" Rich Greenfield, media and technology analyst at LightShed Partners, previously told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The linear TV business is just under a lot of pressure, and investors are already asking me, 'Well, who are they selling it to? Who wants to buy a linear TV business?'""Other industry watchers said a possible asset sale is likely necessary to protect the business's future — but only with the right buyer.""We agree that asset sales are a good idea, but our best advice would be to sell all (or all the content assets) of DIS to AAPL, AMZN, or another company that never needs to make money from creating content,"" Needham analyst Laura Martin previously wrote. ""If they don't sell, DIS will be competing against those companies in an industry with deteriorating economics (because they never need to make money from content), we believe.""Some have even said Disney should consider splitting up the business. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson suggested the company should be broken up into two entities: one focused on parks, Disney+, and studio IP and another focused on Disney’s linear networks, ESPN+, Hulu SVOD, Hulu Live TV, and Disney+ Hotstar.""I'm not in the camp that says that Disney really needs to split up,"" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich previously told Yahoo Finance, maintaining the solution likely won't be enough to solve Disney's myriad problems.""Having said that, I think all options, and Bob Iger has made this very clear, all options are on the table,"" she said.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Unlike some types of stocks, the price of real estate generally rises along with inflation. Thus, these types of investment vehicles may be better hedges against inflation than other types of investments.But when it comes to determining the best REITs, there are several factors to consider. Not all are created equal, and some REITs are indeed struggling despite the favorable backdrop. Most investors who buy REITs favor income over capital gains. Therefore, just like with other types of dividend stocks, free cash flow is king. The trust must also have other things going for it to enable high total return.So if you are after the best REITs then keep reading. Here are some of the best choices for September.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRealty Income Corp. (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income Corp. (NYSE:O) has a reputation for consistent dividend payouts, having done so for more than 50 years. Its diversified portfolio of retail and commercial properties has traditionally ensured steady rental income, even in economic downturns.With a robust 99% occupancy rate at the end of Q2 2023, the firm has shown its ability to renew leases at higher rates. A concern is its increased debt, which stood at $19.6 billion, but Realty Incomes’ strong cash flow, backed by high occupancy and rising rentals, has led to continuous dividend growth. This helps make it one of those best REITs to buy in September.When looking at the firm’s technical aspects, things are a mixed picture. It trades below its long-term moving averages, but then this may be a blessing in disguise. Isn’t it wiser to buy stocks when they’re cheap instead of the other way around? Also, there’s some evidence shown by its moving average convergence divergence and relative strength index that momentum is returning to the upside, suggesting it may be wise to invest in the short as well as long-term timeframes.Story continuesDigital Realty Trust (DLR)a stock image of a person working on data charts using a futuristic computer.Source: ShutterstockDigital Realty Trust (NYSE:DLR) stands as a leading global provider of data center REITs. With the growth of the internet, AI, cloud computing and other data-intensive technologies, it’s anticipated that demand for data centers will continue.What makes DLR stock one of those best REITs is its short and long-term financial results. In the second quarter this year, it reported a net income of $0.37 per share, up from $0.19 in Q2 2022. While funds from operations (FFO) per share was $1.52, slightly down from $1.55 in Q2 2022, revenues reached $1.4 billion, marking a 20% year-on-year increase. The company’s net income stood at $116 million and Adjusted EBITDA was at $697 million.In terms of analyst opinions, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. Truist Financial lowered its target price from $175.00 to $130.00 but maintained a “buy” rating. In contrast, Jefferies Financial Group raised its target to $144.00, while StockNews.com gave DLR a “sell” rating. at the time of writing, the average analyst rating is “Hold” with a target of $120.93.The consensus of these analysts is that there’s upside potential in store for DLR in the short term, while its tailwinds in the data center space may yield future returns.Prologis (PLD)The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPrologis (NYSE:PLD) is a titan in the industrial real estate sector, primarily focusing on logistics properties. As the e-commerce industry continues to expand, the demand for distribution centers and warehouses near urban centers has surged.Despite the challenges posed by interest rates, the company maintains a solid balance sheet and has witnessed FFO/share growth. With properties in 19 countries and strong tenant retention, Prologis is further diversifying into solar energy and EV charging.It’s good to not just invest in REITs but also invest in a diversified basket of REITs. PLD stock may tick these boxes if one is invested in other more popular REITs such as residential property or commercial buildings. This then gives it an advantage over other choices on this list, as industrial picks can be hard to come by. It’s a reason it’s one of those best REITs to buy.On the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Strattec Security. See our latest analysis for Strattec Security ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Strattec Security?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Strattec Security. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Strattec Security's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Strattec Security. Our data shows that GAMCO Investors, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 18% of shares outstanding. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 12% of common stock, and Dimensional Fund Advisors LP holds about 6.2% of the company stock. Additionally, the company's CEO Frank Krejci directly holds 2.0% of the total shares outstanding.Story continuesOn further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 7 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is some analyst coverage of the stock, but it could still become more well known, with time.Insider Ownership Of Strattec SecurityThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.We can see that insiders own shares in Strattec Security Corporation. As individuals, the insiders collectively own US$7.1m worth of the US$101m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board, though we generally prefer to see bigger insider holdings. But it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 33% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Strattec Security. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

(NASDAQ:NTAP) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.50 per share on the 25th of October. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 2.6%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for NetApp NetApp's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. Before making this announcement, NetApp was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 11.4%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 45%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future.historic-dividendNetApp Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.60 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that NetApp has been growing its earnings per share at 42% a year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly, and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.We Really Like NetApp's DividendIn summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for NetApp (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) Stock's Recent Performance Got Anything to Do With Its Financial Health?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mondelez-international-inc-nasdaq-mdlz-130037655.html,1694869237,STORY,['MDLZ'],"[Most readers would already know that Mondelez International's (NASDAQ:MDLZ) stock increased by 3.0% over the past week. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Mondelez International's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:14% = US$4.1b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Mondelez International's Earnings Growth And 14% ROEAt first glance, Mondelez International seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 11%. However, for some reason, the higher returns aren't reflected in Mondelez International's meagre five year net income growth average of 2.6%. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Mondelez International's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 11% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is MDLZ worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MDLZ is currently mispriced by the market.Is Mondelez International Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 48% (implying that the company retains the remaining 52% of its income), Mondelez International's earnings growth was quite low. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Mondelez International has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 51% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Mondelez International's future ROE will rise to 18% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Mondelez International certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

YTD, it’s up nearly 16% and 39% over the past year. After the discount retailer reported its Q2 2023 results, Barron’s reported that Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih was very complimentary about its business:Story continues“’TJX’s report is a testament to the strength of the Off-Price model in a consumer slowing backdrop,’ wrote Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih in a note to clients. ‘Inventory remains plentiful in quality and quantity, and consumers’ pressured wallets are seeking value via the Off-Price channel.'”There is no question that TJX’s off-price business model is an enduring one that will continue to generate profitable growth.Of the 25 analysts that cover its stock, 19 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a $99 median target price.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the financial sector, S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a recommendation rating of 1.70, according to Finviz.com, and a share price between $100 and $500.The company best-known for its S&amp;P Indices business is having a decent year in the markets. It’s up more than 17% YTD, about 103 basis points ahead of the index. Of the 23 analysts that cover its stock, 21 rate it Overweight or an outright Buy, with a median target price of $450.50, 14% higher than its current share price. The last time I called on SPGI was in July. The financial stock was one of three names that analysts generally liked. Nothing’s changed in that regard. Well, not entirely. S&amp;P Global reported its Q2 2023 results a week after my July article. They were decent if not a thing of beauty. Revenues rose 3% on an adjusted basis to $3.1 billion, while its operating income was $1.43 billion, 2% higher than Q2 2022. At the midpoint of its guidance, the company expects revenues to grow 5% in 2023, with earnings per share of $12.45. That’s 11% higher than in 2022.  By hook or by crook, CEO Doug Peterson will continue to grow S&amp;P Global profitably.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comRepresenting the tech sector, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has a recommendation rating of 1.80 and a share price over $500. The company’s share price jumped by more than 4% in mid-August after reporting results that were much better than expected. On September 6, Intuit launched its first artificial intelligence (AI) product, Intuit Assist. It is part of CEO Sasan Goodarzi’s $20-billion bet on AI and big data that he made almost the day he became the company’s chief executive in 2019. Fortune’s Geoff Colvin recently reported that Goodrarzi said: “At the end of the day, there are certain decisions you have to make. And the decision I made was, as a team, we’re going to bet the company on data and AI.”Between TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mailchimp, Intuit has a treasure trove of data from more than 177 million customers. Good data is critical to good AI. That puts Intuit heads above anyone else when rolling out AI-focused financial apps. While the decisions made by Goodarzi back in 2019 involved risk, the CEO considers not taking action would have been equally risky:“We are at the beginning of the journey with AI,” Goodarzi told Fortune. “In the next five to 10 years it will create new economies and destroy some economies, will create new experiences, fuel new company growth and make certain companies go out of business.”In fiscal 2024 (July year-end), Intuit expects to grow its revenues and earnings by double digits, hence why it’s one of the stocks analysts love. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

66,0943e0bd-17e8-3464-a5b2-86ee78056cf7,VRSN,2023-09-17,The 7 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-warren-buffett-stocks-175429313.html,1694368469,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'JNJ', 'OXY', 'LPX', 'VRSN', 'BRK-B']","[If we’re going to get right down to it, banking on the best Warren Buffett stocks comes down to leveraging decades of experience. Unlike, say, financial luminaries on YouTube, the Oracle of Omaha has seen it all – bull markets, bear markets and whatever the heck we’re currently in. When Buffett speaks, you listen.Of course, Buffett has a wide range of names within the holdings of his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). As one of my colleagues at InvestorPlace stated, there’s no way you’re going to buy every single idea that’s proposed. Therefore, we’ve got to narrow the list down to the best Warren Buffett stocks. Naturally, this begs the question: just how do we define what’s the best?To be sure, the word is subjective. However, I’m going to do something different to add value by targeting Oracle-approved securities that benefit from a combination of analyst endorsement and favorable options dynamics. Please refer to this article for a rundown on the basic concepts I’ll be using.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAnd with that, below are the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy now.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) specializes in hydrocarbon exploration (upstream) in the U.S. and the Middle East. In addition, the company manufactures petrochemicals in the U.S., Canada and China. Since the start of the year, OXY gained nearly 6% of equity value. On Thursday, shares closed at $64.57.Presently, OXY represents 4.1% of Berkshire’s portfolio. As such, it’s one of the largest ideas under the context of the best Warren Buffett stocks. Turning to the options market, OXY’s volatility smile – or the implied volatility (IV) plotted at various strike prices – possibly demonstrates a mix of bullish speculation as well as mitigation for tail risk.Specifically, IV rises from its low of 0.23 at the $68 strike price and increases to 0.47 at the $85 strike. Thus, options premiums have increased as the price moved out of the money (OTM), assuming from a call holder’s perspective. Still, IV also jumped to 0.7 at the $40 strike, suggesting mitigation for a black swan-like event.Story continuesStill, analysts peg OXY as a moderate buy with a $68.87 price target, implying nearly 7% upside.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ StockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the biggest names in the healthcare industry, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is now focused on developing and producing pharmaceutical drugs and medical device technologies. Despite exceptional, longstanding relevancies, JNJ incurred a rough outing in 2023 thus far. Since the January opener, shares stumbled more than 10%. On Thursday, JNJ closed at $160.03.Looking at the options arena, its volatility smile may endorse shares as one of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy now. From an IV low of 0.15 at the $165 strike price, the metric soars to 0.57 at the $245 strike. Moving in the deep in the money (ITM) direction (i.e. to the left), IV hits a peak of 0.47. Put another way, while risk mitigation exists, it appears traders are leaning more toward a bullish outcome.Further, with IV rising distinctly in the OTM direction, this framework incentivizes traders to sell options to collect rich premiums. Indeed, options flow data – which filters for big block trades likely made by institutions – reveals just that: institutional firms appear to be selling puts, which have bullish implications.To top it off, analysts peg JNJ a moderate buy with a $180.18 price target, implying almost 13% growth.Verisign (VRSN)verisign logo on a signSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.comBased in Reston, Virginia, Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN) operates a diverse array of network infrastructure. Since the beginning of the year, VRSN gained almost 3%, which isn’t that impressive. However, it could be one of the under-appreciated best Warren Buffett stocks to buy now. On Thursday, shares closed at $207.75.Turning to the options arena, VRSN presents a risk-mitigated opportunity. At the $195 strike price, IV sits at its low point of 0.15. From there, in the OTM direction (right), IV rises to 1.02 at the $320 strike. On the other side of the equation, IV rises to 1.61 at the $105 strike when moving in the deep ITM direction.Primarily, traders are leery of tail risks to the downside. At the same time, they recognize the Verisign’s upside potential. At the moment, VRSN represents 0.8% of Berkshire’s portfolio.To sway the decision, analysts peg VRSN as a moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $239.50, implying over 15% upside potential.Globe Life (GL)A health insurance claim form with a stethoscope, a calculator, and several hundred dollar bills resting on top.Source: Valeri Potapova / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in McKinney, Texas, Globe Life (NYSE:GL) is a financial services holding company. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Globe Life provides life insurance, annuity and supplemental health insurance products. Although boring, it’s a relevant enterprise, making it one of the best Warren Buffett stocks. Since the January opener, GL slipped 9%, closing recently at $108.64.Focusing on GL’s volatility smile, astute investors may appreciate the possible opportunity here. At the $110 strike price, IV drops to a low of 0.16. From there, it largely swings consistently higher to an IV of 1.36 at the $170 strike. However, moving in the deep ITM direction, IV only rises to 0.85 at the peak. Comparatively speaking, then, it’s possible that traders mostly anticipate upside from here on out.However, one point to bring up is that GL is only about 0.1% of Berkshire’s portfolio.Still, analysts seem to like Globe Life, pegging it a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $126, implying nearly 16% upside potential. For a reliable play during ambiguous times, GL ranks among the best Warren Buffett stocks.Coca-Cola (KO)KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of iceSource: monticello / ShutterstockA soft-drink behemoth, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) also doubles as a symbol of American capitalism. Plus, given the Oracle’s sweet tooth, KO is a perfect ambassador for the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy now. Unfortunately, 2023 hasn’t been particularly kind to Coca-Cola, with shares tumbling more than 7%. On Thursday, KO closed at $58.33.Shifting gears to its volatility smile, traders appear to be anticipating a broad rise in the share price. At the $61 strike, IV sits at a low point of 0.12. Moving in the far OTM direction, IV soars to 0.59 at the $75 strike. On the other side of the equation, IV peaks at 0.39 at $47 for the deep ITM direction.As mentioned earlier, a higher IV incentivizes traders to sell options to collect premiums and that’s exactly what’s happening. Based on Fintel’s options flow screener, institutional traders appear to be selling puts at various expiration dates in 2024 and 2025. Usually, sold puts represent a bullish tactic.For confirmation, analysts peg KO a consensus strong buy with a $71.82 price target, implying 23% upside potential.Louisiana-Pacific (LPX)two construction workers on a worksiteSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) is a building materials manufacturer. Per its public profile, the enterprise is well known for its engineered wood building products. If you take the Oracle’s message of not betting against America to heart, LPX could be one of the best Warren Buffett stocks. Since the January opener, LPX gained nearly 2% to close at $60.41 recently.Turning to the volatility smile, LPX presents an unusual backdrop. At the $62.50 strike price, IV drops to a low of 0.28. Moving in the far OTM direction, IV rises to 1.93 at the $115 strike. This indicates anticipation of strong activity at the OTM prices, possibly suggesting long-term optimism.On the other hand, IV skyrockets from 0.36 at the $42.50 strike to 1.94 at $32.50. To me, this dynamic could reflect mitigation of a tail risk (i.e. black swan event). However, because IV is stable between $42.50 to $70, traders may not see the tail risk as a likely event.Also, analysts peg LPX a moderate buy with a $76.57 price target, implying nearly 27% growth.Nu Holdings (NU)Nubank mobile app on white cell phone and credit card on black surface. NU stock.Source: Lais Monteiro / ShutterstockOne of the riskiest names among the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy now, Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is a financial technology (fintech) specialist based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Per its public profile, the company has become one of the largest independent digital banks in the world. Plus, Wall Street loves it, with shares skyrocketing to a nearly 92% return since the beginning of January.Looking at its volatility smile, NU presents on enticing backdrop. On Thursday, shares closed at $6.83. At the $7.50 strike price, IV sits at a low of 0.42. Moving toward the far OTM direction, IV flies to a peak value of 2.01. This framework suggests intense anticipation of activity further up the OTM price scale, possibly indicating strong optimism.On the flipside, IV only rises to 1.13 at the $3.50 strike, which may imply limited anticipation of downside risk. Given the rich premiums involved with the high IV at far OTM prices, it’s no surprise that institutional traders have sold many puts with 2024 expiration dates.Finally, analysts peg NU a moderate buy with a $9.27 price target, implying nearly 36% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Whirlpool's current trading price of US$138 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Whirlpool’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Whirlpool What Is Whirlpool Worth?According to my valuation model, Whirlpool seems to be fairly priced at around 5.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Whirlpool today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $145.63, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Whirlpool’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from Whirlpool?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a relatively muted revenue growth of 2.8% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Whirlpool, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in WHR’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on WHR, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Whirlpool.If you are no longer interested in Whirlpool, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

And if you believe that the stock is really worth $167.45, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Estée Lauder Companies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on.

It’s another to be warned about it in the grocery store.""Shrinkflation"" refers to companies giving customers less of their products for the same (or higher) price. The tactic has become widespread among consumer goods suppliers amid high inflation.Now, the French supermarket chain Carrefour is exposing examples of it for shoppers, with labels on shelves reading: “This product has seen its volume or weight fall and the effective price from the supplier rise.”Dozens of products have been hit with the labels since Monday, according to Reuters.“The aim in stigmatizing these products is to be able to tell manufacturers to rethink their pricing policy,” Stefen Bompais, director of client communications at Carrefour, told the news agency. Carrefour will soon enter annual price negotiations with Nestlé, Unilever, PepsiCo, and other owners of well-known brands.Among the shrinkflation examples it’s showing shoppers are Guigoz infant formula, produced by Nestlé, and a bottle of sugar-free peach-flavored Lipton iced tea, produced by PepsiCo.Despite the cost of raw materials falling, consumers goods companies have not been cooperating with efforts to cut prices, Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard has argued. He’s found in ally in French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who’s urged corporations to lower prices—and pointed a finger at Unilever, Nestle and PepsiCo for not complying.Of course, retailers themselves have been accused by consumer groups of shrinkflation with their own products—among them, Carrefour. But European governments are increasingly trying to help consumers hurt by the rising cost of living, in part by pressuring big companies to lower prices.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?
