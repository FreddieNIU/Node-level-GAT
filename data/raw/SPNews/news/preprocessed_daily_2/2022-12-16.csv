Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Charles Schwab has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Charles Schwab will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Charles Schwab's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 25%. As a result, it also grew EPS by 23% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 18% per annum over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Charles Schwab is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Charles Schwab's P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Charles Schwab's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   1 warning sign for Charles Schwab  you should be aware of.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this chipmaker have returned +1.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Texas Instruments belongs, has gained 3.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Texas Instruments is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.25 points to a change of +12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.02 indicates a change of -13.3% from what Texas Instruments is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Texas Instruments is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for TXN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Texas Instruments, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.61 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.97 billion and $18.39 billion estimates indicate +8.8% and -7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTexas Instruments reported revenues of $5.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.9%. EPS of $2.45 for the same period compares with $2.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +3.38%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Texas Instruments is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Texas Instruments. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nucor is evaluating locations in the Midwest and the Southeast.""As our nation continues to replace its aging electric grid, extend transmission infrastructure to connect renewable generation locations and modernize its digital network, we see tremendous growth potential in the need to build this critical infrastructure using some of the cleanest, most sustainable steel in the world,"" said Leon Topalian, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nucor Corporation. ""The growth of Nucor Towers &amp; Structures is further execution of our strategy.""Earlier this year, Nucor formed the Nucor Towers &amp; Structures business unit when it acquired Summit Utility Structures LLC, a producer of metal poles and steel structures for utility infrastructure in eastern Pennsylvania. While that location primarily serves customers in the northeastern part of the country, Nucor will establish a nationwide footprint with these two new facilities. The growing demand for utility infrastructure is being driven by grid hardening and replacements, renewable energy projects, and population growth. Additional demand for utility infrastructure will result from the Inflation Reduction Act, recently passed by Congress, which provides more than $300 billion for clean energy and climate programs.The two new greenfield transmission tower production plants will be extensively automated and will include advanced hot-dip galvanizing operations. Each facility will utilize highly efficient straight-line production and will increase Nucor Towers &amp; Structures' capabilities to provide engineered solutions for utility infrastructure and construction projects. The locations for these two new facilities will be determined in the next few months.Story continues""We look forward to adding these two new facilities and to continue to serve in the rapidly expanding utility, infrastructure and telecommunication markets,"" said Chad Utermark, Executive Vice President of New Markets and Innovation.  ""Towers and Structures adds a new dimension to our arsenal of value-added downstream products, and furthers our team's commitment to exceptional customer service, market-leading quality and reliability.""About NucorNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel and steel products, with operating facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

11,0b28ba55-6eef-3530-acfe-d374ee0fdf05,NUE,2022-12-16,5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Before 2022 Wraps Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-dividend-hikes-123412175.html,1671107652,STORY,"['LW', 'AMGN', 'NUE', 'PWR']","[The bearish sentiment remains dominant in stock markets as we are coming close to the end of 2022. The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq have yielded negative returns of 16.17%, 6.53% and 28.60%, respectively, so far this year. Investors have lost a massive amount of wealth across most of the sectors and the economy is expected to run into recession in the coming year.Domestically, inflation in the United States, has been the biggest challenge for the economy. inflation, as reflected by the consumer price index (CPI), came in at a 7.1% increase year over year for November, showing signs of cooling off, after the record high of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. Yet, it is far from the Federal Reserves’ ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy.November’s services sector PMI data, provided by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), jumped to 56.5% from 54.4% in October, indicating exceptional growth. At the same time, the employment level increased to 263,000 jobs for November, and the average hourly income rose 0.6% for the month, up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. The above data suggest that the Fed’s efforts to check inflation by drying the liquidity and slowing down the labor market are ineffective.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has continued with a hawkish monetary policy by a 0.5 basis point increase in overnight interest rate, marking its seventh hike in 2022. The cumulative interest is now in the range of 4.25-4.5%, making it the maximum since 1980. The chair has mentioned that the Fed will continue to increase its rate in the New Year as long it’s needed to meet the inflation goal.Global geopolitical tensions, especially the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in global oil and gas scarcity during winter, are leaving indirect impacts on the supply-chain disruptions. A fresh COVID-19 breakout in China forced the authorities to impose restrictions in several cities in China, shrinking businesses and consumer activity. Such situations have impacted business around the world and aggravated volatility in the stock market.Story continuesThus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in matured businesses with regular dividend payout. These dividend stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Investors can expect a regular flow of income along with the preservation of capital against unexpected price changes. It is often seen that a company, which tends to reward its investors with a high dividend payout, comparatively outperforms non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Lamb Weston LW, Nucor NUE, Quanta Services PWR, Toro TTC, and Amgen AMGN that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Lamb Weston is an Eagle, ID-based company.

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Everyone likes betting on fast-moving trending stocks, but it isn't easy to determine the right entry point. These stocks often lose momentum when their future growth potential fails to justify their swelled-up valuation. In that phase, investors find themselves invested in shares that have limited to no upside or even a downside. So, betting on a stock just by looking at the traditional momentum parameters could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.PVH (PVH) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 21.5% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. PVH meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 37.7% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for PVH is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 2.09. This indicates that the stock moves 109% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that PVH has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped PVH earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, PVH is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. PVH is currently trading at 0.51 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 51 cents for each dollar of sales.So, PVH appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to PVH, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

17,7d46ee1e-c5e6-33c0-8c66-9e4fb273f740,TMO,2022-12-16,Investors in Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) have made a strong return of 194% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-thermo-fisher-scientific-nyse-110050510.html,1671188450,STORY,['TMO'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) share price has soared 191% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's down 1.1% in the last seven days.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Thermo Fisher Scientific managed to grow its earnings per share at 25% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 24%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Thermo Fisher Scientific's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thermo Fisher Scientific's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Thermo Fisher Scientific's TSR for the last 5 years was 194%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Thermo Fisher Scientific shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 15% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 19%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 24% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TMO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Thermo Fisher Scientific's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific's main business drivers.Headquartered in Waltham, MA, Thermo Fisher Scientific is a scientific instrument maker and a world leader in serving science. In Nov 2006, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. was formed through the merger of Thermo Electron Corporation with Fisher Scientific International Inc. On Feb 3, 2014, Thermo Fisher acquired Life Technologies Corporation.Following the acquisition, the new reporting segments are:Life Sciences Solutions Segment: This segment (39.9% of total revenues in 2021) was added post the acquisition of Life Technologies. It incorporates majority of the former Life Technologies and Thermo Fisher’s Biosciences businesses. In 2021, this business registered growth of 28.5% from 2020.Analytical Instruments: Formerly known as Analytical Technology, this segment (15.5%) has been renamed in order to reflect the transfer of the bioprocess production business to the newly formed Life Sciences Solutions Segment. In 2021, this business registered growth of 18.4% from 2020.Specialty Diagnostics (SD): This segment (14.4%), formed after the acquisition of Phadia, serves customers in healthcare and clinical laboratories with a portfolio of diagnostic test kits, reagents and instruments used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses to improve patient care. In 2021, this business registered growth of 5.9% from 2020.Story continuesLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: Formerly known as Laboratory Products and Services, this segment (37.9%) has been renamed to to reflect the inclusion of the PPD acquisition. PPD will be referred to as clinical research business within this segment. This segment serves laboratory customers with equipment and consumables that improve productivity and a range of BioPharma outsourcing services. This segment also includes the company’s research and safety market customer channels. Post-acquisition, Thermo Fisher’s Global Chemicals business has moved to the Laboratory Products and and Services Segment. In 2021, this business registered growth of 21.4% from 2020.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Thermo Fisher Scientific a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in December 2012 would be worth $8,833.98, or a 783.40% gain, as of December 15, 2022, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 182.64% and the price of gold increased 2.42% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for TMO too.Thermo Fisher exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The robust year-over-year revenue growth in the Analytical Instruments and the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments appears promising. Thermo Fisher’s accelerated investments to expand bioproduction capacity also buoy optimism. In the quarter, Thermo Fisher witnessed strength in three out of its four end markets. The upbeat guidance for 2022 is indicative that this growth momentum will continue. Thermo Fisher has outperformed its industry in the past year. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in the Life Science Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics segment is disappointing. The contraction of both margins on escalating costs and expenses does not bode well either. The year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings is concerning.Shares have gained 5.82% over the past four weeks and there have been 10 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

19,ced94d93-2e24-392a-b587-ea4a142470d3,USB,2022-12-16,Six Reasons to #GiveTime This Holiday Season With Volunteering,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/six-reasons-givetime-holiday-season-151500732.html,1671117300,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PH', 'USB-PP', 'USB-PQ', 'USB-PR']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 15, 2022 / For the sixth consecutive year, U.S. Bank is partnering with the nonprofit VolunteerMatch to promote volunteerism on Giving Tuesday - which falls on November 29 this year - and throughout the holiday season.U.S. Bank, Thursday, December 15, 2022, Press release pictureThe theme of this year's #GiveTime campaign is ""we shine brighter together"" and, in keeping in that spirit, here are six reasons why it's a gift not just to our communities but ourselves to take thoughtful time to invest our hearts and minds in helping others.1. You Have More TimeMost people are off work or home from school during the holidays, so this makes it even easier to find some time to help those in need during the holidays or in the new year. Throughout the year, we can easily get caught up in our day-to-day responsibilities, and it can be hard to carve out the time needed to volunteer.You never know, if you enjoy your volunteering experience (and you most likely will), you'll be more liable to seek out service opportunities down the road.2. Volunteering Spreads Holiday CheerDonating food, cooking, serving a meal aren't the only ways to help those in need this holiday season. While many of us may get stressed out about family gatherings, think of the individuals who don't have their family near to spend time with.You can volunteer to help veterans in your community, get involved with a hospital that puts on a holiday celebration for patients, volunteer at a retirement home, and so much more.3. You Can Lead by ExampleWith so many family members around during the holidays, why not set a good example for the little ones (or even the stubborn adults)? Lead by example: share your plans to volunteer and explain why you want to be of service. Then encourage your family to register for kid and teen-friendly volunteer opportunities in your area.Help your family, especially the younger members, understand some of the benefits of volunteering.4. You'll Get Back Just as Much as You GiveVolunteering is not working for free. Sure, there's no monetary compensation, but you get just as much (if not more) out of it than you put in. You gain countless benefits from volunteering including health benefits such as a boost in your mood, happiness and satisfaction.Story continues5. You Can Try Something NewBecause of all the different volunteer opportunities available to you during the holidays - like teaching, building, crafting and more - you have the chance to try something new or something you never thought of trying before. Who knows, you might even discover a new hobby or passion, or you may stumble upon a hidden talent!6. It Helps You Appreciate What You HaveHelping someone in need can put things into perspective. It's an eye-opening experience that helps us count our blessings and realize the things we should be grateful for. Volunteering can help you adopt this attitude of gratitude.There are so many different ways to give. With VolunteerMatch, it couldn't be easier to find volunteer opportunities in your area. Remember, although we encourage volunteering during the holidays, it's important for nonprofits to have volunteers year-round. So even if you can't find the perfect chance to give back during the holidays, there's still plenty you can do to help out in the new year.This article is shared courtesy of VolunteerMatch, which originally published much of the content on its website.Learn more about U.S. Bank hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.usbank.com/index.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732009/Six-Reasons-to-GiveTime-This-Holiday-Season-With-Volunteering]"

Lower-tier consumer trends could remain unchanged, given rising wages and job availability.Higher-income consumers are less likely to be impacted by short-term macro changes, especially for essential items.Due to its defensive product mix and sharp price points, Walmart remains well-prepared to manage challenging economic trends, including recession.Longer term, Walmart plans to continue to capitalize on its opportunity to add value, grow the assortment (primarily through its marketplace), enhance the customer experience, and reduce friction across the business.The company also continues to expand its vision beyond retail and e-commerce, focusing on building a robust ecosystem, including advertising, merchant services, last-mile delivery, health services, and digital payments.These new ecosystem elements are more profitable than traditional retail and should strengthen Walmart's relationship with customers and generate good market share gains.Price Action: WMT shares traded lower by 1.29% at $144.78 on the last check Thursday.Latest Ratings for WMTDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightFeb 2022Raymond JamesMaintainsOutperformFeb 2022Deutsche BankMaintainsBuyView More Analyst Ratings for WMTStory continuesView the Latest Analyst RatingsSee more from BenzingaMeta Keeps Losing Key Heads In Its Biggest Target Payments MarketDonald Trump NFTs Are Here: How You Can Buy Them And Get Dinner With The Former President - Digital WorldDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

People are stealing in order to resell, and it is certainly hurting the bottom line.""That's been the case at Target (TGT), Best Buy (BBY), Walmart (WMT), and other big box stores this year.""At Target, year-to-date, incremental shortage has already reduced our gross margin by more than $400 million vs. last year,"" Target CFO Michael Fiddelke told investors on an earnings call last month.

25,96ce6dc0-32df-3142-b261-7305f6c8779e,WMT,2022-12-16,Why Is Walmart (WMT) Down 1.2% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-walmart-wmt-down-1-163004843.html,1671121804,STORY,['WMT'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Walmart (WMT). Shares have lost about 1.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Walmart due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Walmart Q3 Earnings &amp; Revenues Top Estimates, View RaisedWalmart  reported robust third-quarter fiscal 2023 results. Walmart’s adjusted earnings of $1.50 per share increased from the year-ago period’s figure of $1.45. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Total revenues of $152.8 billion grew 8.7% and beat the consensus mark of $147.4 billion. On a constant-currency (cc) basis, total revenues climbed 9.8%.Revenue growth was backed by strength in all the company’s segments.The consolidated gross profit margin contracted by 89 basis points (bps), primarily due to markdowns and a sales mix in the U.S. segment, a LIFO charge at Sam’s Club related to inflation and the timing of Flipkart’s annual event. The gross margin at Walmart U.S. fell 77 bps due to increased general merchandise markdowns and a mix shift toward grocery, somewhat offset by pricing.The adjusted operating income at cc rose 4.6% to $6.1 billion. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined by 75 bps year over year due to solid sales growth and reduced costs associated with COVID-19. The company’s global advertising business soared more than 30% due to Walmart Connect in the U.S. segment, along with Flipkart advertising.Walmart U.S.: The segment’s net sales grew 8.5% to $104.8 billion in the reported quarter. U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, improved by 8.2% due to a 6% increase in the average ticket, with transactions rising 2.1% year over year. Comp sales were mainly driven by strength in food categories, the solid sales of private brands, an elevated average ticket and increased store transactions. Comp sales grew across the grocery and health &amp; wellness categories. The segment continued to see an increased market share in grocery.E-commerce boosted comps by 80 bps. E-commerce sales in the segment rose 16%. On a two-year stack basis, e-commerce sales surged 24%. As of the third quarter, Walmart U.S. had 4,600 pickup locations and more than 3,900 same-day delivery stores. The company remodeled more than 235 stores during the reported quarter. The operating income of the Walmart U.S. segment jumped 4.8% to $5.1 billion.Walmart International: The segment’s net sales rose 7.1% to $25.3 billion. Currency movements had a $1.5-billion adverse impact. On a cc basis, net sales jumped 13.3%. The company witnessed double-digit sales growth in Walmex and Flipkart. The operating income, on a cc basis, grew 3.2% to $0.9 billion.Sam’s Club: The segment, which comprises membership warehouse clubs, witnessed a net sales increase of 12.8% to $21.4 billion. Sam’s Club’s comp sales, excluding fuel, grew 10%. While transactions grew 4.8%, the average ticket rose 4.9%. Comp sales saw broad-based strength across most categories, mainly led by food. However, tobacco hurt comp sales. The membership income climbed 8% in the quarter, reflecting strong membership trends, with a record total member count. The plus penetration rate continued to rise. E-commerce fueled comps by 120 bps.E-commerce net sales jumped 20% at Sam’s Club on a robust direct-to-home show and solid curbside performance. The segment’s operating income came in at $0.6 billion, up 18.3% year over year.Story continuesGuidanceBased on a solid third-quarter show, management raised its guidance for fiscal 2023. Walmart now expects consolidated net sales growth of nearly 5.5% for fiscal 2023. Excluding divestitures, the metric is likely to grow roughly 6.5%.Walmart expects currency headwinds of nearly $4.1 billion in the fiscal. Management earlier anticipated consolidated net sales growth of nearly 4.5% at cc. Excluding divestitures, the metric was expected to grow nearly 5.5%. U.S. comp sales, excluding fuel, are likely to be roughly 4% now compared with the 4% growth expected before.  Management now expects the consolidated adjusted operating income to decline 6.5-7.5%. The metric was earlier expected to decline 9-11%. Excluding divestitures, management expects the consolidated adjusted operating income to decline 5.5-6.5% now compared with the prior projection of an 8% to 10% decline. Management envisions earnings per share (EPS) to decline 6-7% in fiscal 2023 compared with the 9% to 11% decline expected before. Excluding divestitures, the EPS is expected to fall by 5-6% compared with the earlier view of an 8% to 10% decline.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Walmart expects consolidated net sales growth of nearly 3%, including currency headwinds of about $1.3 billion. Comp sales growth at Walmart U.S. (excluding fuel) is likely to be 3%. The consolidated operating income growth is expected between a decline of 1% to an increase of 1%. The adjusted EPS is likely to decline 3-5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.VGM ScoresAt this time, Walmart has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Fed fund rates now stand in the 4.25% to 4.50% range, the highest since December 2007. This was expected. But what wasn’t expected by the market participants was the central bank asserting more tightening in 2023 while signaling a rise in the unemployment rate and a near stalling of economic growth.The Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at the press conference, following the conclusion of the two-day FOMC meeting, said, “We still have some ways to go.” He further added, ““I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustained way. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.”The Fed officials now anticipate the interest rates to reach 5.1% by 2023-end (up from the previously projected 4.6% in September) before coming down to 4.1% and 3.1% by 2024 and 2025, respectively. As interest income constitutes a major portion of banks’ revenues, higher interest rates, along with decent loan demand, will offer support. Hence, banks like JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Huntington Bancshares HBAN, BOK Financial Corporation BOKF and Zions Bancorporation ZION are expected to witness solid top-line improvement.When the Fed cut short-term interest rates to near-zero in March 2020 amid the pandemic, banks witnessed net interest margin (NIM) compression. Now, with the central bank raising rates, banks including JPM, BAC, HBAN, ZION and BOKF are expected to continue recording an increase in the NIM going forward.Despite this favorable development, there is a cause for concern for banks as the Fed offered a very grim economic picture while reiterating its aggressive stance to bring inflation down. The inflation is cooling down, with the November reading of 7.1% marking a second straight monthly fall.But the path to bring down inflation to its target will inflict some pain on the economy. Per the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will be slowing down considerably next year, with just 0.5% growth compared with the previous expectation of 1.2% growth.Banks’ financials are tied to the health of the economy. As the economy slows down and demand for loans wanes, banks’ earnings are likely to be adversely impacted. This will present a huge challenge for banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Huntington Bancshares, BOK Financial and Zions.So, for banks, the situation will be like a double-edged sword. But this shouldn’t drive the investors away from bank stocks. Over the past decade, several operating efficiency-strengthening initiatives and stringent regulatory capital requirements have made banks fundamentally stronger. Banks have moved away from risky operations and are now focused on bolstering core businesses.A conservative lending policy, higher interest rates and a strong balance sheet position will keep supporting banks. Global diversification and changing the mix to focus more on other revenue sources, along with technological advancements, will continue aiding financials.Undoubtedly, the operating environment will get tough for banks in 2023. But investors must not shy away from investing in banking stocks that are fundamentally strong and have long-term prospects. At the same time, they must keep their eyes open for any near-term headwinds.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

31,f0b139b5-087f-3796-9f50-826e5a969b1b,MGM,2022-12-16,4 Toxic Stocks That Can Drag Down Your Portfolio Performance,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-toxic-stocks-drag-down-112611042.html,1671189971,STORY,"['MGM', 'DZSI', 'VWS.CO']","[Since the beginning of 2022, markets have been bearing the brunt of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Rising interest rates and inflationary concerns are keeping investors on edge. The most important thing during bear markets is avoiding big errors. Regardless of your market approach to investing or trading, there is only one way to protect your portfolio from a large loss. Selling at a small loss before it snowballs into a large loss is the only way to ensure that a devastating drawdown does not occur within the context of a portfolio.Considering the current market mood filled with ambiguity, it’s as important to get rid of fundamentally weak toxic stocks as it is to invest in attractively valued companies possessing fundamental strength.Toxic companies are usually characterized by huge debt loads and are vulnerable to external shocks. These stocks might illusively scale lofty heights in a given time period, but the good show doesn’t last for these overblown toxic stocks, as their current price is not justified by their fundamental strength. Accurately identifying such bloated stocks and getting rid of them at the right time can protect your portfolio.Overpricing of these toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational enthusiasm surrounding them or some serious fundamental drawbacks. If you own such bubble stocks for an inordinate period of time, you are bound to see massive erosion of wealth.Nonetheless, if you can precisely spot such toxic stocks, you may gain by resorting to an investing strategy called short selling. This strategy allows one to sell a stock first and then buy it when the price falls. While short selling excels in bear markets, it typically loses money in bull markets.So, just like identifying stocks with growth potential, pinpointing toxic stocks and offloading them at the right time is crucial to guard one’s portfolio against big losses or make profits by short selling them. Icahn Enterprises IEP, Vestas Wind Systems VWDRY, MGM Resorts International  MGM and DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc DZSI are a few such toxic stocks.Story continuesScreening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.P/E using a 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and the next during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy/Hold-rated stocks that generally outperform or are in line with the market.

That's the price the crude would be sold at if a buyer loaded it directly from a Russian terminal.The Russian Finance Ministry's Urals price, used as the basis for taxation, is calculated by the Argus pricing agency, which takes into account the blend prices in the Baltic and Black Sea including the cost of insurance and freight (CIF), which is higher than the FOB level.According to Reuters data, the Urals price for delivery from the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk on a FOB basis is currently $48.69 per barrel.It is $57.28 on a CIF basis.Market sources said Urals crude has been sold at deeper discounts this month following a European ban on Russian oil imports, and dominant buyer India has bought barrels at well below the West's $60 price cap.Since Russia sent its troops into Ukraine in February, India has become the main outlet for seaborne cargoes of Urals crude.For some deals this month, the price for Urals in Indian ports, including insurance and delivery by ship, has fallen to around minus $12-$15 per barrel versus a monthly average of dated Brent, down from a discount of $5-$8 per barrel in October and $10-$11 in November, according to the market sources.Story continuesThe spread, or difference, between Urals and dated Brent - the price of physical, light North Sea crude oil, - has risen sharply from early February, when it stood at around minus $1. Now it has reached minus $30.The European Union, G7 nations and Australia introduced the $60 per barrel price cap on Russian oil, effective from Dec. 5, on top of the EU's embargo on imports of Russian crude by sea and similar pledges by the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain.Analysts have said the cap will have little immediate impact on the oil revenues that Moscow is currently earning.Oil and gas exports are forecast to account for 42% of Russia's revenues this year at 11.7 trillion roubles, according to the country's finance ministry, up from 36% or 9.1 trillion roubles in 2021.(Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Mark Potter)]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221215005750/en/The announcement comes as the momentum and influence of B2B marketing continues to rise. Accelerated by the pandemic and the digitalization of B2B, brand marketing has become an imperative for B2B leaders looking to build competitive advantage and long-term value.The total value of the Top Ten B2B brands has risen to $530,052m from $442,709m in 2021, which represents 20% growth year-over-year. In 2022, B2B brands make up 17% of the total value of the Best Global Brands table.According to the report data, the rate of growth of B2B brands outstrips that of B2C brands and, because the buying audience is now 73% millennial, we see the fastest growing brands—Microsoft, Adobe and Siemens—outperforming on three critical factors: Participation, Agility, and Affinity, which are about building a sense of community beyond the transaction, speed to market and creating more emotional connections. The top performing brands also have a higher role of brand in the purchase decision criteria (as opposed to more functional features such as price, availability, or product specs).Kelly Higgins, Chief Marketing Officer at Doremus said: ""This is an exciting time for B2B brands and marketers. Those that recognize the growth potential of this moment and embrace the power of a strong brand will be best positioned to achieve competitive advantage and long-term success.""Story continuesDaniel Binns, Global Chief Growth Officer, Interbrand said: ""The B2B space is incredibly dynamic right now and we’re seeing a shift away from performance marketing, recognizing that B2B businesses need to build brands not just tactically drive the sales funnel. For talent, for investment, for license to operate, for customers. The world’s most successful brands create a relationship beyond the transaction—and we are seeing this more and more in a B2B space.""The B2B Special report combines the brand valuation methodologies of Best Global Brands with insights on the complex realities facing B2B brands in their path to success, including expert perspective from B2B marketers representing some of the world’s leading brands.The report is part of a broader strategic partnership between Interbrand and Doremus+Co to help B2B companies navigate a dynamic and evolving marketing landscape and realize the potential of their brand through more connected, end-to-end experiences.To download the full report, please visit: https://interbrand.com/thinking/enterprise-recalibrated-special-report-downloadAbout Doremus+CoDoremus+Co is Omnicom’s B2B specialist, a global, integrated agency with offices in New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.

The company’s facing ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain major headwinds for its Digital Media segment. Also, high acquisition expenses do not bode well for its margin expansion.However, Adobe is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. The company’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving the top-line growth. Further, rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps are major positives. Additionally, growth in emerging markets and robust online video creation demand remain tailwinds.Additionally, solid demand for Adobe’s commerce offerings and growing adoption of Acrobat. We remain optimistic about Adobe’s market position, compelling product lines and continued innovation. Considering the aforesaid facts, the Zacks analyst expect fiscal 2022 revenue to grow 11.5% year over year.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Adobe here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Salesforce have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-46.8% vs. -24.7%).

59,eb3043c3-e93d-3601-9d25-05a48e3cbaa2,MSFT,2022-12-16,ChatGPT isn’t an Immediate Threat to Alphabet (Nasdaq:GOOGL) - but Likely Change the Search Landscape,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chatgpt-isn-t-immediate-threat-093025792.html,1671183025,STORY,"['GOOGL', 'MSFT']","[This article first appeared on Simply Wall St NewsOpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, has captured the world’s attention since being released two weeks ago. The chatbot uses OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to answer questions and perform tasks using natural language. The platform gained a million users within five days of its launch, no doubt aided by users sharing their interactions with the chatbot on social media platforms.While not without its flaws, the chatbot can provide detailed and nuanced answers to surprisingly detailed questions. In many cases, it does a better job than Google search, by providing a single, detailed answer to questions.The obvious question then is whether it’s a threat to Alphabet’s ( Nasdaq: GOOGL ) primary business.The Business ModelChatGPT is optimized to provide answers. On the other hand, Google is optimized to earn ad revenue while providing a list of potential answers in the form of web pages and ads.Google search is one of the most profitable businesses in the world. At present, ChatGPT is a beta version of whatever it may become. It uses massive amounts of computing power, which is expensive, and there is no business model or revenue at present. OpenAI’s models are available to developers via API, but the chatbot which is the ‘retail’ version is free to use, and therefore a cost center for OpenAI.Search TypesWhen someone uses Google search, the information they are looking for could be divided into two categories: informational or commercial. An informational search would be for something like a historical, geographical, or scientific fact, or for academic research. Most of these types of searches probably aren’t monetized by Google.A commercial search would be for a product or service - a nearby restaurant, airline tickets, car tires, or something like that. These searches are obviously of economic value to Google because they can place ads within the results.ChatGPT is more useful for informational searches. So while it does compete directly with Google search, it doesn’t compete as effectively with the more profitable types of searches. ChatGPT is also useful for other types of tasks - copywriting, summarizing text, and writing code - but those services don’t compete with Google search either.Story continuesKnowledge workers like journalists, analysts, and programmers who get a lot of value out of a tool like ChatGPT may be prepared to pay for it - either for a monthly fee or on a per-use basis. But that would be a relatively small group for Google to lose - and much of their search activity probably isn't profitable anyway.Google already has its own AI models. Maybe they are better than OpenAI’s, maybe not, but they are probably quite good at searching for information. Until now, Google has had little incentive to make them available to the public because they would cannibalize search traffic. But that could change if an external chatbot becomes a threat to Google.The Microsoft ThreatMicrosoft  ( Nasdaq: MSFT ) is very closely aligned with OpenAI. In 2019 Microsoft invested $1 billion in the venture and seems set to invest more going forward. OpenAI’s models run on Azure, and Azure makes those models available to its clients.So, it’s quite possible that Microsoft will combine OpenAI models with its Bing search engine. That could lure some users away from Google’s search engine. Of course, Google could do something similar with its own AI models. Even if it wasn’t quite as good as a Bing/OpenAI product, it might be good enough to keep users on board - habits are hard to break.Is Alphabet’s margin of safety wide enough?Analyst estimates for Alphabet’s EPS have fallen sharply over the last 12 months. Even EPS forecasts for 2027 are 30% below where they were in January. The current trajectory is for EPS to grow by 12% for the next five years, with revenue growing at 10%. We would say those estimates are  fairly conservative.The Simply Wall Street DCF model estimates Alphabet’s value at $168 using those growth projections. That implies a 46% discount at the current price of $90. In other words, there is a modest margin of safety.The other five value metrics we track also suggest the stock price is reasonable - but not dirt cheap.The Bottom LineThe threat Google faces from OpenAI may be smaller than it appears at first glance. And, Alphabet’s current valuation means there is a modest margin of safety.Of course, there are other ways Alphabet could surprise to the upside. The company has a large portfolio of other companies that could become more profitable, and some could be spun off too. Alphabet also has a lot of space to cut costs - the current cost of sales is $123 bln and Opex is $79 bln. The company has no shortage of options.One thing is likely though - information search is about to change for consumers.If you would like to learn about other companies benefitting from artificial intelligence, follow this link.Have feedback on this article?

The Mission Driven Bank Fund (the Fund) will be established to support Minority Depository Institutions (MDI) and Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) banks through direct investment, market development and other technical support services. The Fund seeks to improve bank sustainability, promote an equitable economy, and address chronic racial gaps in access to financial services.The Fund will focus on the approximately 300 mission-driven banks across the country that are essential in expanding access to credit in traditionally unbanked and rural communities and communities of color. MDI and CDFI banks drive access to wealth and income-building opportunities, such as owning a home, expanding a small business, or buying land, for people and families that have otherwise been underserved by the financial system.The Fund’s anchor investors, Microsoft and Truist, selected the two firms in a competitive process. The lead firms have partnered with subadvisors Strategic Value Bank Partners and West Potomac Capital LLC, who have significant experience in financial services investing in both public and private markets, including investing in, and serving on boards of, MDI and CDFI banks. All four firms expect to serve as expert resources to portfolio companies, providing operational and technical assistance to address financial and non-financial barriers to growth.Microsoft director of Impact Investments, Joel Combs, who was involved in the selection process, emphasized the complementary background of the two co-managers. ""With impact investing, Microsoft looks to innovate, act as a catalyst, and partner to create positive change. Elizabeth Park brings specialized knowledge of regulated financial institutions, while Calvert Impact has a track record of driving impact in underserved markets through creative solutions and bringing other investors along,"" Combs said. ""With West Potomac Capital LLC and Strategic Value Bank Partners as sub-advisors, this truly was a case of the sum adding up to more than the parts.""Story continues""We’re excited by the mission of this fund and this team we are working with,"" said Truist’s head of corporate development and Truist Ventures, Tarun Mehta. ""This is an opportunity to help MDI and CDFI banks accelerate their mission and fulfill Truist’s purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. We look forward to partnering with other institutions that share our vision for a more inclusive and equitable financial system.""In addition to the anchor investors, Warner Bros. Discovery has committed to the Fund, bringing the total initial commitments to $120 million, a significant milestone towards a goal of $500 million to $1 billion.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) encouraged the establishment of the Fund.""The FDIC is pleased that Microsoft and Truist have selected managers for the Mission-Driven Bank Fund to provide capital investment for Minority Depository Institutions and CDFI banks,"" said Betty Rudolph, Director of the Office of Minority and Community Development Banking at the FDIC. ""These institutions play a vital role in their communities, offering small businesses and families access to critically needed financial products and services.""According to Elizabeth Park President Fred Cummings, the Fund will invest across the capital structure. ""The capital flexibility will match the needs with capital to create lasting improvement, a core differentiator versus a private fund’s narrow investment mandate or aggressive ROI targets,"" said Cummings.""Access to high-quality, affordable financial products is fundamental to the economic development of every community in the United States. Mission-driven banks serve those who have historically lacked access to credit and financial services, so strengthening them strengthens communities,"" said Jennifer Pryce, president and CEO of Calvert Impact.

But now, the trend seems to have reversed, just in time for the busy holiday travel season.According to motoring and leisure travel giant AAA, the average price of regular gas) in the U.S. currently sits at $3.214 per gallon, which is below the $3.323 per gallon we saw this time last year.Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at fuel price tracker GasBuddy, sees the trend continuing as Americans prepare to hit the road for the holidays.In a recent Fox Business interview, the host asked De Haan whether the national average price of regular gas could drop below $3 a gallon.His answer was positive.“I think that certainly looks like a very good possibility here, probably as early as December 23,” he said.And since rising gas prices drove up inflation earlier on, falling gas prices might help bring it down.“This is where there’s some deflation happening,” De Haan added.De Hann is not the only one seeing inflation slowing down. Goldman Sachs strategists have a similar view.“Our economists expect by early 2023 it will become clear that inflation is decelerating and the Fed will reduce the magnitude of hikes and eventually cease tightening,” Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a recent note to investors.The investment bank also identified a list of stocks that tend to outperform in a falling inflation environment. Here’s a look at three of them.Don't missUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classThe average home insurance policy is nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)AT&amp;TLet’s start with a household name.AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. More than 100 million consumers in the U.S. use its mobile and broadband services. At the same time, the company also serves nearly all of the Fortune 1000 companies with connectivity and smart solutions.Story continuesAnd because wireless and internet services are essential for the modern economy, AT&amp;T generates recurring business through thick and thin.The company pays quarterly dividends of 27.75 cents per share, translating to an annual yield of 5.8%.Considering that the average S&amp;P 500 company yields just 1.6% at the moment, AT&amp;T could be worth a look for income-seeking investors.Read more: Grow your hard-earned cash without the shaky stock market using these easy alternativesUnited Parcel ServiceE-commerce has been one of the fastest-growing segments in the market, and the stay-at-home environment induced by the pandemic only made online shopping more popular.But it’s freight companies like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) that made e-commerce possible in the first place.UPS posted solid financial results for Q3, as consolidated revenue grew 4.2% year-over-year to $24.2 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share rose 10.3% to $2.99.Shares are down 14% in 2022, but a potentially strong holiday quarter could bring back some investor enthusiasm. Management expects full year consolidated revenue to be around $102 billion.Walgreens Boots AllianceDespite being one of the essential service providers, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) hasn’t been a market darling. Shares are down 23% in 2022 and 43% over the past five years.But the company is on Goldman Sachs’ list.That’s likely because while Walgreens shares have fallen, its payout to shareholders has been on the rise. In July, the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 0.5% to 48 cents per share, marking its 47th consecutive annual dividend increase.Looking further back, you’ll see that the retail pharmacy giant has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than 89 years.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on December 22, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis payroll processor and human-resources services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.Revenues are expected to be $1.18 billion, up 6.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paychex?For Paychex, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Paychex will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paychex would post earnings of $0.97 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.03, delivering a surprise of +6.19%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paychex doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

71,db103bc7-89f3-3000-8986-fb6dc01ad23b,PAYX,2022-12-16,Paychex Reveals Top Regulatory Issues for Businesses in 2023,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paychex-reveals-top-regulatory-issues-150000209.html,1671116400,STORY,['PAYX'],"[ROCHESTER, N.Y., Dec. 15, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Paychex, Inc., a leading provider of integrated human capital management software solutions for human resources, payroll, benefits, and insurance services, today released a list of the regulatory issues that employers should monitor in the new year. The company's list, compiled annually, outlines the most prominent compliance-related topics employers will need to contend with in 2023 and explores the legislative and regulatory context surrounding these issues.Top Regulatory Issues of 2023This year, funding and tax credit eligibility rose to the top of the list, as business leaders manage the economic impacts of inflation and turn to programs like the Employee Retention Tax Credit and the Inflation Reduction Act. Businesses should also prepare for potential legislation and regulations that could impact how to classify workers, pay workers, and provide paid time off for their workers.The company's compliance professionals have identified the following topics as key considerations for employers in 2023:#1 Small Business Funding. Despite the absence of any new federal programs to date, businesses can still take advantage of the funding opportunities carrying over from the COVID-19 pandemic, including:The Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC). Businesses that paid qualified wages to keep employees working from March 12, 2020 through Sept. 30, 2021 (and for some certain businesses identified as Recovery Startups, wages could be paid through Dec. 31, 2021) have until either April 15, 2024 (for three quarters of 2020) or April 15, 2025 (for all four quarters of 2021) to file amended returns and retroactively claim the credit. Paychex Protection Program (PPP). The Small Business Administration is still accepting applications for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness if submitted before the maturity date of the loan. The Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act, doubled the maximum amount of the Research and Development Tax Credit, giving certain businesses in tax year 2023 a chance to claim up to $500,000 annually for qualified research activities.State Incentives. Some states also continue to sponsor programs that enhance funding efforts to help businesses, including 38 approved State Small Business Credit Initiative programs.Story continues#2 Pay Equity. Pay equity was again on the agendas of state and local legislative bodies in 2022, with more jurisdictions expected to pass legislation in 2023. By the close of 2022, seven states and several local jurisdictions have passed legislation requiring employer pay transparency. Employers will also need to stay on top of federal and state initiatives that may pass in 2023 to address pay inequity through annual reporting similar to the existing California Pay Data reporting and the Illinois Equal Pay reporting intended to mitigate race and gender discrimination in pay.#3 Worker Classification Guidance. In late 2022, the U.S. DOL released a proposal to revise the Department's guidance on determining who is an employee or an independent contractor under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). While the U.S. DOL is expected to release a final rule in 2023, the rule will only be applicable when determining worker status under federal wage and hour law. Employers must continue to be diligent in maintaining awareness of and compliance with the other complex tests for determining worker status under the many other federal, state, local, and industry-specific regulations and laws.#4 Encouraging Retirement Savings. There is a significant chance that a version of SECURE 2.0 will pass before the year's end, substantially impacting the retirement space. Building on the framework of the SECURE Act of 2019, SECURE 2.0 has a handful of key provisions, including an expansion of eligibility for the tax credit when a business establishes a workplace retirement plan,  an increase in the RMD age, mandated automatic enrollment for certain retirement plans, even student loan payment matching that aims to counter two crises – student loan debt and retirement savings at the same time.#5 Wage and Hour Regulations. Based on listening sessions held in mid-2022, it's anticipated that the U.S. DOL will release proposed changes to the federal overtime regulations. The changes would reflect the current labor market, including an increase in the salary threshold for exempt workers. Additional regulations at the state and local level are anticipated in areas including fair scheduling ordinances, and the elimination of sub-minimum wage rates and tip credits in certain jurisdictions. An increase in industry-specific requirements, particularly in the hospitality, retail and healthcare sectors, may be on the horizon following efforts like the California FAST Recovery Act which, although potentially subject to voter approval in 2024, proposes to create a council with the authority to set wage and hour standards for fast food workers.#6 Paid Leave. While a federal paid leave program does not appear to be on the horizon for 2023, several states across the country considered legislation in 2022 to provide employees with paid time off to care for themselves and covered family members. Maryland and Delaware are the latest states to pass mandated paid family leave legislation, joining nine other states and the District of Columbia. In 2023 we will also see the start of the first opt-in, voluntary paid family leave insurance program, available to employers or directly to employees, with legislation passed in New Hampshire.#7 Privacy/Cyber Security. With the growth and continued norm of a hybrid and remote workforce, businesses must adapt privacy policies and cyber security practices in a manner that effectively balances the needs of the business, against both employee and customer expectations with respect to the privacy of personal information. Businesses must be clear and transparent about the collection, use, storage, and retention of data. In the absence of a federal privacy law, states continue to broaden the scope of their data protection laws.""We understand that keeping up with shifting regulations can be a challenge for business owners—and that missteps can have serious consequences,"" said Frank Fiorille, vice president of risk, compliance, and data analytics at Paychex. ""The past few years have sparked a widespread re-evaluation of the employee-employer relationship, and that wave of change shows no signs of stopping. With more legislative shifts on the horizon, Paychex will continue to support America's businesses, helping them navigate the compliance landscape and remain successful.""Other areas of interest for businesses to consider include tax changes, hybrid and remote work, and healthcare reform.

72,3dbd64c4-4b21-3e0a-8d10-54aa6051b9f5,SBUX,2022-12-16,Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-nasdaq-sbux-hoping-turn-130158602.html,1671195718,STORY,['SBUX'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So while Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has a high ROCE right now, lets see what we can decipher from how returns are changing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Starbucks:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$28b - US$9.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Starbucks has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Starbucks roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Starbucks compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Starbucks here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEOn the surface, the trend of ROCE at Starbucks doesn't inspire confidence. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 38%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Our Take On Starbucks' ROCEEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Starbucks. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 93% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesSince virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Starbucks   (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should know about.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Plus, no matter what city you're in in the world, you can count on consistency in the drinks you've come to love at most locations. But those tasty drinks and food can add up in cost quickly, and if you're trying to cut back on your expenditures, spending cash on fancy coffee is probably not going to make it to your budget. Before you have to walk away entirely from your favorite Starbucks drinks, consider these 9 hacks that can save you money and allow you to indulge.Take a Look Back: 2022 Year in ReviewSee: 3 Easy Tips To Turn Your Credit Woes Into WowsPrachana Thong-on / Shutterstock.comJoin the Starbucks Rewards ProgramThe simplest and most obvious answer for saving money is to download the Starbucks app and sign up for their rewards program. Not only does it make mobile ordering super simple, but you also earn points on anything you purchase. And, from time to time, they offer additional deals and incentives through the app to get you to spend more and earn more points. These points can be redeemed for free drinks and food.Take Our Poll: How Has Inflation Impacted Your Holiday Shopping Plans?UnsplashStarbucks Free RefillsStarbucks also offers incentives to register a Starbucks card or use their app by offering you free refills of brewed coffee (hot, iced coffee or cold brew) and tea (hot or iced) during a single store visit. Once your visit is over, so are your free refills for that day, and the offer does not apply to drive-thru locations.Those customers who aren't registered Starbucks members can refill their brewed coffee or tea for a discounted price.Adrianna Calvo / PexelsFree Food or Drink on Your BirthdayOne of the few times during the year when you can truly get something free from Starbucks is to go in on your birthday. You do need to be signed up for Starbucks Rewards at least seven days prior to your birthday and provide them with your birthdate information. Starbucks also requires you to make a qualifying purchase (must earn at least 1 star reward) before your birthday.Story continuesYou should receive an email two days before your birthday with a reminder to come and enjoy a free piece of food or beverage (almost anything on the menu). Just present your app or a registered Starbucks card when you visit.StarbucksTake Advantage of PromosStarbucks loves a good promo, and rewards members will be the first to know about most of them. These can include treat receipts, happy hours and holiday promotion, according to The Spruce Eats, but also include Starbucks Bonus Bingo and other fun ways to help you satisfy your urge for coffee with your need to spend less.Joshua Trujillo / StarbucksSplit a VentiA venti is Starbucks' second largest drink size at 20 oz. The largest in the Trenta at 30 oz. Splitting a venti coffee between two people means 10 oz of delicious drink for both of you at less than half the price of a grande. According to Fast Food Menu Prices, a grande latte is $3.65. A venti is $4.15. If you split it with a friend, you each pay less than $2.10 for the same number of oz as a tall.James Warwick / Flickr.comOrder a ShortIf you thought you were limited to the three main cup sizes at Starbucks -- tall, grande and venti -- there's actually a secret size that might just hit the spot and save you some cash. Introducing: the short. At 8 oz, that short isn't too short -- and not only do you save cash, but you also save calories. While prices vary according to region and location, the short costs less than the tall.UnsplashMake Your Own Iced LatteDepending upon location, most Starbucks leave out a carafe of cream and milk on the condiment station. You can hack this to make your own iced latte, according to The Spruce Eats, by ordering an espresso over ice in a grande or venti cup and adding as much complimentary milk as you like.Monarexx / Shutterstock.comGo Light on the IceWhile this hack might not save you money, per se, it will get you more drink for your buck: If you order an iced drink, ask for light ice, which will leave more drink in your cup. If it's not cold enough, stick it in the fridge for a few minutes at home.mokjc / Shutterstock.comUpsize Your CupWhen you order your cup of coffee, Starbucks baristas typically fill that sucker to the top, which is great, but it often means you have to dump out coffee to add your milk. Instead, you can order your smaller size in a bigger cup. So, a tall coffee in a grande cup, or a grande coffee in a venti cup, so that you won't have to dump in order to add milk or cream.

(NASDAQ:XEL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-xcel-energy-180059083.html,1671127259,STORY,['XEL'],"[How far off is Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Xcel Energy Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$795.0m-US$1.41b-US$1.52bUS$1.01bUS$1.34bUS$1.64bUS$1.92bUS$2.15bUS$2.35bUS$2.51bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 31.91%Est @ 22.93%Est @ 16.65%Est @ 12.25%Est @ 9.17%Est @ 7.01% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.4% -US$747-US$1.2k-US$1.3kUS$789US$978US$1.1kUS$1.2kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.9bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.4%– 2.0%) = US$57bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$57b÷ ( 1 + 6.4%)10= US$31bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$36b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$71.3, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xcel Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Xcel EnergyStrengthNo major strengths identified for XEL.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electric Utilities industry.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Grainger and Expeditors International of Washington",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-archer-103910311.html,1671187150,STORY,['ADM'],"[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 16, 2022 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Company ADM, W.W. Grainger, Inc. GWW and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:3 Best Dividend Aristocrats to Buy Ahead of 2023The Federal Reserve’s recent monetary tightening measures to crush inflation rattled investors’ sentiment. U.S. stocks snapped a two-day winning streak on Dec 14, with major bourses ending in negative territory after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank needs more solid data to change its view on inflation.The Fed has been hiking rates this year from almost zero at the fastest pace since the 1980s in order to curb 40-year high inflation. However, a rate hike doesn’t bode well for the broader economy as it impacts consumer spending levels and increases borrowing costs, including mortgages, business debt, and car loans.Nonetheless, the Fed increased its interest rate by half a percentage point, pushing the benchmark federal-funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5%, which is the highest level since December 2007. Even though the latest increase in interest rate has been less than the series of four consecutive three-quarter point rate hikes this year, Fed officials expect to keep increasing rates through next year, with no further reduction until 2024. Such a new phase of policy tightening, in all likelihood, may well trigger more volatility in the stock market in the near term.The Fed officials, in fact, now expect to raise interest rates between 5% and 5.5% next year and hold it at that range for some time in 2024. The policymakers unanimously said that the “ongoing increase” in interest rates to pull prices lower is appropriate even if it slows down the economy.Story continuesThe Labor Department, by the way, announced that U.S. consumer prices did register their smallest annual increase in almost a year in November.The consumer price index increased 7.1% on an annual basis last month, its smallest advance since December 2021. Yet, such readings remain well above the Fed’s 2% goal. Moreover, the Fed is only willing to change its monetary policy stance if inflation comes down to its target range in a sustainable fashion, which isn’t happening anytime soon.Thus, with the Fed expected to remain hawkish in the near future, and consequently, markets remaining volatile, it would be judicious to invest in dividend aristocrats such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, W.W. Grainger, Inc. and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. for steady income.These stocks remain unperturbed by market gyrations due to their strong fundamentals and better-quality business.

Let’s take a closer look at each one.Caterpillar Caterpillar is the world’s largest construction-equipment manufacturer. The company designs, develops, engineers, manufactures, markets, and sells machinery, engines, financial products, and insurance to customers.The company’s earnings outlook has turned bright over the last several months, landing CAT into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.1%, nicely above its Zacks Industrial Products sector average. In addition, the company’s payout has grown 9% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher Daniels MidlandArcher Daniels Midland is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from various agricultural products.Story continuesLike CAT, Archer Daniels Midland has seen its near-term earnings outlook improve over the last several months, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchADM’s annual dividend currently yields 1.7%, below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, the company’s 4.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral DynamicsGeneral Dynamics, an A&amp;D company, engages in mission-critical information systems and technologies, land and expeditionary combat vehicles, armaments and munitions, shipbuilding and marine systems, and business aviation.GD’s annual dividend yields a respectable 2%, visibly higher than its Zacks Aerospace sector average. Further, General Dynamics’ payout has grown by an impressive 8.7% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also sports a favorable growth profile; earnings are forecasted to climb more than 5% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 15% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue increases of 2.1% in FY22 and 7.4% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividend Aristocrats are top-tier investments for those focusing on income, as these companies have successfully upped their dividend payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years.Since these companies have been able to up their dividend payouts for such an extended period of time, it’s more than valid to expect them to continue this trajectory.Of course, it goes without saying that investors have cherished dividends in a historically-volatile 2022.For income-focused investors, all three stocks above – Caterpillar CAT, Archer Daniels Midland ADM, and General Dynamics GD – are worthy considerations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Tobacco and Cigarette Stocks To Buy. The global tobacco products market grew from $234.84 billion in 2021 to $250.51 billion in 2022, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate of 6.7%. The Russia-Ukraine war hindered the chances of global economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the near-term. This impacts the growth of the tobacco sector as well, despite it being relatively defensive. The tobacco products market is forecasted to reach $287.09 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 3.5%. The world's population, which is currently at 8 billion, is growing steadily and is expected to be 10 billion by 2050. This will create higher demand for tobacco products in the future. The demand for tobacco has lately seen a shift from the developed countries to the developing regions such as Asia and Africa. This can be due to the rising population, increasing income levels, and relaxed government regulations. The tobacco market is putting out multiple premium tobacco products such as flavored, long and skinny, coloured and e-cigarettes, which has created an optimistic outlook for future growth. A boost in research and development investments has led to the introduction of nicotine products with lower levels of toxicants. This has attracted a bigger consumer-base for tobacco products. Some of the best tobacco and cigarette stocks to buy include Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE:SMG), and Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO). Our Methodology We selected the following tobacco, cigarette, e-cigarette, and cannabis stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility.

TPB has three segments, Zig Zag rolling papers, Stokers smokeless tobacco, and “New Gen,” a collection of investments in vaping and other alternative products. Zig Zag and Stokers are both performing very well, together run-rating approximately $100mm of annual EBITDA. Zig Zag is benefitting from the ongoing trend of cannabis legalization, and Stokers is a low-cost, high-quality competitor in its niche, taking share and operating under a pricing umbrella. New Gen, though, is struggling and operating at close to break-even levels. It is this third segment that investors seem to be focused on. The stock is cheap even assuming New Gen is worth nothing, and I believe risk-reward is asymmetrically skewed to the upside.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Tobacco and Cigarette Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:10 Best Water Stocks To Buy Now12 Best FMCG Stocks To Buy Now10 Undervalued Insurance Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 10 Best Tobacco and Cigarette Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Exclusive insights show that 76% of consumers who send money and 75% of consumers who receive money, respectively, expect to transfer and collect even more funds over the next year.The study, which surveyed more than 1,000 UAE-based citizens and residents who send and receive cross-border money transfers, explores consumer sentiment on how, when and why they move money. The results bolster Western Union’s recently announced ‘Evolve 2025’ (E25) strategy of combining high-value, accessible retail and digital financial services.Family support is highlighted by 60% of senders as the primary reason for transferring money overseas. Saving for the future comes in a distant second, ranked by 11% of senders. A well-known melting pot of cultures, the UAE is home to more than 200 nationalities and ranks among the top most talent competitive countries. Some of its more sizeable communities come from the world’s largest remittance-receiving economies.Caring for family back home is further re-enforced as one of the main factors driving the number and amounts of overseas transfers. Furthermore, as increased living expenses and global currency fluctuations create additional pressure on personal finances, 74% state that because of higher cost of living in the country they send to, they need to transfer more money. Seventy-one percent state that they take the opportunity to send more money when the currency value falls in their receiving country.Story continues""To remit is often a very personal decision. Western Union data also supports that one of the most common reasons why consumers remit is to support loved ones and family,"" said Jean Claude Farah, President of Middle East and Asia Pacific at Western Union. ""So it is only natural that as the global economic climate challenges affordable ways of living, family support takes precedence over everything else as senders move money.""""Continuously attracting such a diverse range of nationalities is a true testament to the UAE’s efforts to position itself as a global partner, and an attractive and influential economic hub,"" Farah added. ""We believe that these ongoing efforts will also mean that the UAE will continue to ride the top spot as one of the biggest senders of remittances in the world. It also makes it even more incumbent on us as businesses to connect people to opportunity; Western Union has been doing this for consumers in the UAE for almost 25 years and is deeply committed to the country. As we evolve and grow in the years ahead, we remain steadfast in enabling an environment that drives financial inclusion and creates pathways for long-term economic success across the country’s societies.""Cultures and familial ties influence the frequency and flow of moneySending money shortly after payday regardless of wider economic circumstance (34%), or family needs back home (32%) are the two best-known drivers of money transfer flow and frequency. However, Western Union’s study also shows a third factor: almost a quarter (21%) of consumers say they focus on sending money during festive occasions such as Ramadan, Christmas, New Year and Diwali, as well as other special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations and anniversaries.In an interesting reversal of this trend, 37% of UAE consumers who receive money transfers also say frequency and amount is influenced most strongly by festive and other special occasions, ranking higher than family needs (27%) or the timing of their sender’s paychecks (18%).""We understand that diverse populations have equally diverse needs. Festive seasons and special moments are a great example, whereby every year, we see an uptick of approximately 6% in the volume of remittance transactions as these occasions approach,"" Farah said. ""Western Union offers a broad mix of digital and retail channels to serve the varying payment needs of millions of customers worldwide. We believe that the trust we enjoy with consumers in the UAE and around the world puts us in a unique position to help millions of people bring their best to society.""Tech-savvy population seeks choice in the futureAs consumers consider how they would like to send and receive money in the future, they value choice above all. Western Union’s study shows that 42% currently send money across borders exclusively through digital channels. However, as they look ahead, 46% want to be able to choose how they send their funds, whether in cash or digitally.A similar sentiment is echoed among receivers. Forty-three percent currently receive money through digital channels only. In the future, 57% want to be able to choose between digital and retail channels when collecting their funds.Those who do not use digital channels, say the top barrier preventing them from sending or receiving money online is their preference for face-to-face interaction, followed by trust. Process or customer experience is also another commonly cited barrier.Farah concluded, ""Findings from the research show that while most consumers can be considered digital-first, many ultimately want to able to choose between digital and retail options, based on their convenience and needs. However, being able to trust in online services is critical, and as an industry, we have work to do helping consumers overcome their concerns. Ultimately, our end goal will always be to ensure that we can support even more people’s financial needs, wherever they are geographically, culturally or economically.""About Western UnionThe Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) is a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for TransDigm Group Is TransDigm Group Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.31bUS$1.61bUS$1.81bUS$2.02bUS$2.18bUS$2.31bUS$2.43bUS$2.52bUS$2.61bUS$2.68bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x2Est @ 7.81%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.84%Est @ 3.98%Est @ 3.38%Est @ 2.96% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$1.2kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$14bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.0%) = US$47bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$47b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$22bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$36b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$628, the company appears about fair value at a 4.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TransDigm Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.051. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TransDigm GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

(NYSE:HCA) over the past 12 months. An insider's optimism about the company's prospects is a positive sign.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At HCA HealthcareOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Founder &amp; Chairman Emeritus Thomas Frist for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$215 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$240. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$19m for 91.70k shares. But they sold 59.56k shares for US$14m. Overall, HCA Healthcare insiders were net buyers during the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

In total, insiders dumped US$5.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider Ownership Of HCA HealthcareFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that HCA Healthcare insiders own 1.3% of the company, worth about US$886m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The HCA Healthcare Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought HCA Healthcare stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. But we take heart from prior transactions. On top of that, insiders own a significant portion of the company. So we're not too bothered by recent selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

HCA recently unveiled the Enhanced Surgical Recovery (ESR) program, a patient-focused, research-backed and multidisciplinary approach to bring about faster recovery of patients post surgery.Shares of HCA Healthcare gained 0.7% on Dec 14.Originating from a recovery program (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery [ERAS]) that has been in use across Europe for a long time, the ESR program of HCA Healthcare has been embraced by 167 of its healthcare facilities.The program works by leveraging pre-, intra- and post-operative intervention that equips HCA Healthcare to devise a better experience for patients and enables them to quickly return to their daily life. The patients participating in the ESR program can benefit from a reduction in the length of stay at hospitals, lesser need for readmissions and reduced opioid usage. Reduced readmissions will save healthcare costs for individuals. Also, frequent readmissions tend to put pressure on a nation's healthcare system.Apart from being of great use to patients, an effective ESR program might lure more patients to choose HCA Healthcare while undergoing surgeries. This, in turn, is expected to boost revenues from performing surgeries. The healthcare provider remains steadfast in developing enhanced practices aimed at providing better care through leveraging data from roughly 35 million patients in a year.HCA Healthcare has undertaken a wide array of measures to build a solid healthcare suite. For complementing the same, it has often resorted to buyouts and collaborations that have enhanced its capabilities, boosted patient volumes and diversified the treatment network.

Bonuses for Goldman’s top 400 partners may even be cut by around half as senior bankers bear the brunt of compensation cuts, Semafor reported.Last year “was an exceptional year for the firm,” Solomon said on Bloomberg Television, adding that 2022 is a “different year and so naturally compensation will be lower.”Economic headwindsWhile Goldman Sachs has largely navigated the rising interest rates and lagging economy of the second half of 2022 better than its Wall Street peers, chief executive David Solomon has continuously warned of a worsening economic outlook for next year.At the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit last week, Solomon said he expected the stock market's slide to continue into 2023 and estimated the odds of a recession hitting the U.S. economy at around two-thirds.Speaking at the Goldman financial services conference, Solomon pointed to these economic headwinds as the reason for bonus cuts. Compensation costs are the largest item in Goldman’s expense line, he said, and “bumpy times ahead” for the global economy would mean compensation would decline from last year’s levels.Besides the economy, pressure to cut compensation costs at Goldman Sachs can be attributed to Solomon's focus on raising the bank's stock valuation and appeasing shareholder concerns. In February, the banking giant set the goal for raising its return on equity, a key measure of profitability, to 14% — a goal Solomon was 2% shy of as of Sept. 30. Now as money in the market dries up, Goldman's CEO must choose between courting the bank's shareholders and rewarding its employees.Story continuesPay cuts for the topBanks are facing the tricky balancing act of capping total spending while still rewarding its top performers in a competitive market for talent—and doing so as the market goes from feast to famine.While big banks saw a boom in investment activity last year as COVID restrictions eased, the drop in demand after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made many companies more cautious of pursuing corporate deals and raising money on the market—exactly the kind of deals that fill banking coffers.At Bank of America's capital market division, total pay is expected to decline by more than a third, the Financial Times reported, with senior managers taking the majority of the hit. The pay of junior staff is less flexible because it is often tied to salary grids and substantial salary increases as they are promoted.Other Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are all reportedly contemplating cutting their investment banking bonuses by 30%.Layoffs for the bottomWhile top bankers see their bonuses cut as banks try to cut compensation costs, junior bankers will face job losses.Morgan Stanley announced on Dec. 6 it would be cutting 2% of its global workforce, or about 1,600 employees out of its 80,000-person team. Meanwhile, in September Goldman Sachs embarked on the biggest round of job cuts since the start of the pandemic, eliminating several hundred roles from its 47,000-person company.Bank of America is bucking the trend by letting natural attrition do most of the headcount reduction. Once employees depart from the company voluntarily, the bank will keep empty positions unfilled, move people around, and retrain them as needed, Moynihan said in a press conference.Many banks are also returning to the Wall Street ritual of culling its weakest performers. Big Wall Street banks including Citigroup, Barclays, and Goldman Sachs typically cut the bottom 1% to 5% of what they deem are the lowest-performing workers right before bonuses are paid. For most banks, the practice was paused in 2020, after the pandemic sparked a two-year boom in activity and dealmaking.Goldman’s decision on bonuses is likely to be finalized this month before they are announced and paid out in January.“Compensation at Goldman Sachs is determined by the performance of the entire firm, not within each business area. The compensation process is not yet completed so any discussion or forecast on specific numbers is premature,” a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said in a statement.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Rishi Sunak’s old hedge fund boss paid himself $1.9 million a day this yearMeet the 29-year-old teacher with four degrees who wants to join the Great ResignationHow much money you need to earn to buy a $400,000 homeElon Musk ‘wanted to punch’ Kanye West after deeming the rapper’s swastika tweet an ‘incitement to violence’ ]"
100,a2efb69a-f379-3398-baf1-b2e1a0522d85,SLB,2022-12-16,Schlumberger (SLB) Stock Moves -0.63%: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-slb-stock-moves-0-224510515.html,1671144310,STORY,['SLB'],"[In the latest trading session, Schlumberger (SLB) closed at $50.11, marking a -0.63% move from the previous day. This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 2.49%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 2.25%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.Heading into today, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had lost 4.83% over the past month, outpacing the Oils-Energy sector's loss of 4.84% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.14% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings report date. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.69, up 68.29% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.83 billion, up 25.8% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.17 per share and revenue of $28.04 billion. These totals would mark changes of +69.53% and +22.3%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.17% higher. Schlumberger is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Schlumberger has a Forward P/E ratio of 23.21 right now.

The good news is it’s almost next year.""Adding to global recession worries, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank further indicated an extended hiking cycle on Thursday. Most major central banks have followed a rate hike strategy in an attempt to reign in inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 764.13 points, or 2.25%, to 33,202.22; the S&amp;P 500 lost 99.57 points, or 2.49%, to 3,895.75; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 360.36 points, or 3.23%, to 10,810.53.Story continuesThe declines marked the biggest one-day percentage drops for the S&amp;P and Nasdaq since Nov. 2, and largest for the Dow since Sept. 13. Each closed at its lowest level since Nov. 9.Equities have rallied since hitting lows for the year in mid-October, as signs of cooling inflation sparked optimism that the end of the Fed's rate hike path could be on the horizon. But the rally has fizzled in December as investors see mixed economic data and a resolute Fed as having increased the chances of a recession.Money market participants expect at least two 25 bps rate hikes next year and borrowing costs to peak at about 4.9% by midyear, before falling to around 4.4% by the end of 2023.Investors also assessed economic data on Thursday that showed a steeper-than-expected decline in retail sales in November and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits falling last week, indicating a tight labor market. The labor market will need to weaken in order to help inflation ease.All the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were in the red, with communication services and technology stocks falling nearly 4% as the worst performing on the session.Netflix Inc slumped 8.63% after a media report that the company would let its advertisers take their money back after missing viewership targets.Nvidia Corp dropped 4.09% after HSBC Global Research began coverage of the chipmaker's stock with a ""reduce"" rating.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.15 billion shares, compared with the 10.63 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.81-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and seven new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 66 new highs and 334 new lows.

The stock slumping today, down at 9%, the biggest intraday drop since April, after a new report from Digiday said the streaming giant is falling short on viewership guarantees it made for advertisers for its new ad-supported tier. According to Digiday, which cited five agency executives, Netflix is now allowing ad buyers to take their money back after missing those viewership targets. The company reportedly only delivered about 80% of the expected audience.Now this is something that's a big deal because a lot of the upgrades that we've seen on this stock has been around the optimism for the ad tier. Now we heard some analysts' reaction today, saying this is not cause for concern. It's still early days for the ad tier. But in the long haul for investors, it's something that is super important.DAVE BRIGGS: No question, and if you just close your eyes for a minute, it feels like all the buzz is surrounding Netflix at the moment.

Laura Martin joined us yesterday, said she sees Netflix as a loser based on two things-- they don't have a dance partner, no theoretical bundle unless they're purchased, and also they have no international growth because they're already there, where others are still going there. So it really is surprising, given all the buzzworthy content they are continuing to turn out, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly extremely concerning here because going back to what Allie said, a number of the positive calls that we've heard from the Street over the last several weeks, or last several months, really, was in anticipation of their ad tier. So if that doesn't perform up to expectations, it could be an ugly 2023 for the stock.DAVE BRIGGS: Indeed, it could. All right.]"

117,c5731e9f-f335-31c5-9e74-aa4b9a40147b,AMGN,2022-12-16,Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN) Dividend Will Be Increased To $2.13,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgens-nasdaq-amgn-dividend-increased-110257221.html,1671188577,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 8th of March to $2.13. This will take the annual payment to 3.2% of the stock price, which is above what most companies in the industry pay. View our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Amgen was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 25.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 55%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendAmgen Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.44 in 2012 to the most recent total annual payment of $8.52. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 19% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Earnings have grown at around 2.8% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. Growth of 2.8% may indicate that the company has limited investment opportunity so it is returning its earnings to shareholders instead. While this isn't necessarily a negative, it definitely signals that dividend growth could be constrained in the future unless earnings start to pick up again.We Really Like Amgen's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Amgen that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

118,8dc158b9-6e2b-3a41-9e8e-51a057cca710,AMGN,2022-12-16,Amgen Inc. (AMGN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-inc-amgn-trending-stock-140002113.html,1671112802,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned -4.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, to which Amgen belongs, has gained 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $17.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.44 indicates a change of +4.6% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amgen is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMGN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.75 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $26.22 billion and $28.48 billion estimates indicate +0.9% and +8.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.8%. EPS of $4.70 for the same period compares with $4.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.57 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.32%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

119,0b28ba55-6eef-3530-acfe-d374ee0fdf05,AMGN,2022-12-16,5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes Before 2022 Wraps Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-watch-dividend-hikes-123412175.html,1671107652,STORY,"['LW', 'AMGN', 'NUE', 'PWR']","[The bearish sentiment remains dominant in stock markets as we are coming close to the end of 2022. The S&amp;P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq have yielded negative returns of 16.17%, 6.53% and 28.60%, respectively, so far this year. Investors have lost a massive amount of wealth across most of the sectors and the economy is expected to run into recession in the coming year.Domestically, inflation in the United States, has been the biggest challenge for the economy. inflation, as reflected by the consumer price index (CPI), came in at a 7.1% increase year over year for November, showing signs of cooling off, after the record high of 8.2% in September and 8.3% in August. Yet, it is far from the Federal Reserves’ ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy.November’s services sector PMI data, provided by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), jumped to 56.5% from 54.4% in October, indicating exceptional growth. At the same time, the employment level increased to 263,000 jobs for November, and the average hourly income rose 0.6% for the month, up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. The above data suggest that the Fed’s efforts to check inflation by drying the liquidity and slowing down the labor market are ineffective.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has continued with a hawkish monetary policy by a 0.5 basis point increase in overnight interest rate, marking its seventh hike in 2022. The cumulative interest is now in the range of 4.25-4.5%, making it the maximum since 1980. The chair has mentioned that the Fed will continue to increase its rate in the New Year as long it’s needed to meet the inflation goal.Global geopolitical tensions, especially the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in global oil and gas scarcity during winter, are leaving indirect impacts on the supply-chain disruptions. A fresh COVID-19 breakout in China forced the authorities to impose restrictions in several cities in China, shrinking businesses and consumer activity. Such situations have impacted business around the world and aggravated volatility in the stock market.Story continuesThus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in matured businesses with regular dividend payout. These dividend stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Investors can expect a regular flow of income along with the preservation of capital against unexpected price changes. It is often seen that a company, which tends to reward its investors with a high dividend payout, comparatively outperforms non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Lamb Weston LW, Nucor NUE, Quanta Services PWR, Toro TTC, and Amgen AMGN that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Lamb Weston is an Eagle, ID-based company. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is a leading global manufacturer, marketer and distributor of value-added frozen potato products, particularly French fries, and provides a range of appetizers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On Dec 14, LW declared that its shareholders would receive a dividend of $0.28 a share on Mar 3, 2023.

This was followed by the European Central Bank also signaling that it will continue raising rates, with headline inflation continuing to trend above the bank’s target range.A batch of weak U.S. and euro zone economic data also showed that both economies are struggling under the yoke of high inflation and rising interest rates.Spot gold was flat around $1,776.15 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,787.05 an ounce by 19:07 ET (00:07 GMT). Both instruments slumped nearly 2% on Thursday.The yellow metal was also set to lose around 1.1% this week, rattled by a recovery in the dollar as investors sought safe haven in the greenback.Gold has largely lost its status as a safe haven this year, as rising U.S. interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. This saw the dollar largely overtake gold as the market’s favored safe haven, despite growing fears of a U.S. recession.Other precious metals were also subject to steep selling this week, given that the Fed’s comments blindsided investors hoping for a shift in the central bank’s hawkish rhetoric. Platinum futures were set to lose 2% this week, while silver futures were down 1.9%.Even so, a majority of investors are still pricing in a smaller, 25 basis point hike by the Fed in February.Among industrial metals, copper suffered deeper losses this week as rising COVID-19 infections in major importer China added another degree of uncertainty to markets already reeling from worsening growth prospects.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $3.7843 a pound, recovering slightly from a 2.5% tumble on Thursday.

Let’s take a closer look at each one.Caterpillar Caterpillar is the world’s largest construction-equipment manufacturer. The company designs, develops, engineers, manufactures, markets, and sells machinery, engines, financial products, and insurance to customers.The company’s earnings outlook has turned bright over the last several months, landing CAT into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 2.1%, nicely above its Zacks Industrial Products sector average. In addition, the company’s payout has grown 9% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchArcher Daniels MidlandArcher Daniels Midland is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients and goods made from various agricultural products.Story continuesLike CAT, Archer Daniels Midland has seen its near-term earnings outlook improve over the last several months, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchADM’s annual dividend currently yields 1.7%, below its Zacks Consumer Staples sector average. Still, the company’s 4.1% five-year annualized dividend growth rate picks up the slack in a big way.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral DynamicsGeneral Dynamics, an A&amp;D company, engages in mission-critical information systems and technologies, land and expeditionary combat vehicles, armaments and munitions, shipbuilding and marine systems, and business aviation.GD’s annual dividend yields a respectable 2%, visibly higher than its Zacks Aerospace sector average. Further, General Dynamics’ payout has grown by an impressive 8.7% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also sports a favorable growth profile; earnings are forecasted to climb more than 5% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 15% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue increases of 2.1% in FY22 and 7.4% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividend Aristocrats are top-tier investments for those focusing on income, as these companies have successfully upped their dividend payouts for a minimum of 25 consecutive years.Since these companies have been able to up their dividend payouts for such an extended period of time, it’s more than valid to expect them to continue this trajectory.Of course, it goes without saying that investors have cherished dividends in a historically-volatile 2022.For income-focused investors, all three stocks above – Caterpillar CAT, Archer Daniels Midland ADM, and General Dynamics GD – are worthy considerations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The past year has been nothing less than a roller coaster for the market, witnessing the wildest events, ranging from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a mounting inflation catastrophe to Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes. To top it off, the looming threats of the economy going into recession in 2023 have been hurting investors’ sentiments.In the latest update from the Federal Reserve’s last monetary policy meeting of 2022, the benchmark lending rate was increased by 50 bps to curb inflation. This took the interest rate to 4.25-4.5%, the highest since 2007. This marked the Fed’s seventh straight interest rate hike in 2022 and reflected a slowdown from the outsized hikes of 75 bps in the last four meetings.Additionally, the Fed policymakers anticipate a three-quarter point increase in the interest rates for 2023 to 5-5.25%. The officials noted that inflation rates remain elevated and expect the ongoing hikes in interest to help improve demand and lower surging inflation. The Fed also lowered GDP projections for 2023 to 0.5% compared with 2.1% mentioned earlier. It anticipates inflation to continue to surge, with expectations revised to 5.6% for 2022 (from 5.4% stated earlier) and 3.1% for 2023 (versus 2.8%).With the risks of elevated inflation and the resulting rise in interest rates, interest-sensitive sectors like housing look troubled. Additionally, the risks of geopolitical tensions are likely to continue in 2023, resulting in fears of a continued lackluster performance of the S&amp;P 500 index. So, what should an investor do at this time?At this time, building upon a portfolio of high-yield dividend stocks could be an excellent way to play in the stock market. The dividend-paying stocks not only offer a defensive play in a troubled market but also provide a steady income for investors amid recessions.Story continuesWhy Dividend Investing?Investing in dividend-paying stocks provides investors with a regular income stream and long-term growth potential. Investors, who do not require a regular stream of income, may choose to reinvest dividends for capital accumulation or increase wealth over the long term.The dividend aristocrats, companies that have a history of increasing their dividends annually for the past 25 years, are the safe investment options. Sectors, including healthcare, consumer staples and utilities, are traditionally considered defensive plays and offer attractive returns to investors in the form of dividends.However, one must be judicious in selecting stocks. The best way is to compare dividends in relation to the company’s net earnings. Companies with high dividend-yield, with a decent payout ratio and strong earnings prospects, can be rewarding investment choices for long-term returns.Best High-Yield Dividend Stocks for 2023With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have narrowed down on five high-yield dividend stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.These S&amp;P 500 stocks have a dividend yield of more than or equal to 2%, as well as a five-year historical dividend growth rate of more than 5%.

But comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled more policy tightening, and the central bank projected that interest rates would top the 5% mark in 2023, a level not seen since 2007.Further comments from other Fed officials fueled the concern. New York Fed President John Williams said on Friday it remains possible the U.S. central bank will raise rates more than it expects next year. The policymaker added that he does not anticipate a recession due to the Fed's aggressive tightening.In addition, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said it is ""reasonable"" to believe that once the Fed's policy rates reached their peak, they could stay there into 2024.""It feels as if finally the market is starting to understand that bad news is bad news, and that is what is starting to occur. Since the October bottoms, the market has continued to price in what I would consider a substantial amount of optimism at the fact the Fed could navigate and pilot a successful soft landing,"" said Dave Wagner, equity analyst and portfolio manager for Aptus Capital Advisors in Cincinnati.""Finally, the market is taking into consideration that bad news should mean bad things for the market.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46; the S&amp;P 500 lost 43.39 points, or 1.11%, to 3,852.36; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 105.11 points, or 0.97%, to 10,705.41.For the week, the Dow lost 1.66%, the S&amp;P fell 2.09% and the Nasdaq declined 2.72%.Money market bets show at least two 25 bps rate hikes next year and a terminal rate of about 4.8% by midyear, before falling to around 4.4% by the end of 2023.Story continuesOn the economic front, a report showed U.S. business activity contracted further in December as new orders slumped to their lowest level in just over 2-1/2 years, although easing demand helped cool inflation.The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday closed below its 50-day moving average, a key technical level seen as sign of momentum.

Awarded biennially by Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, the Don Tyson Prize recognizes outstanding achievement in American art. Dr. Willis, University Professor and Chair of the Department of Photography &amp; Imaging at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, is the fourth recipient of the prize.As an artist, author and curator, Willis' art and research has focused on cultural histories envisioning the Black body, women and gender. She is a celebrated photographer, acclaimed historian of photography, MacArthur and Guggenheim Fellow, and recipient of the 2014 NAACP Image Award.Her latest exhibition, The Black Civil War Soldier, on view at New York University Kimmel Windows Gallery through March 1, 2023, is based on a book of the same name. Portraits of Black soldiers, whether taken in a photographic studio, on a battleground, or on a campground, are connected to the concept of democracy and citizenship expressed by abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass. Through the work, Prof. Willis seeks to engage that sense of activism and highlight the various acts of courage by Black men and women, both bonded and free, during the Civil War, as well as the rewards they received. She also co-curated the current exhibition ‘Free as they want to be:’ Artists Committed to Memory in Cincinnati, Ohio, running Sept. 30, 2022 - March 6, 2023, as part of the 2022 FotoFocus Biennial.“There is something about looking at images that forces me to question the narratives of the past. I have long been puzzled by the imagery of Black peoples, and I have tried to make sense of the story that has been told,” Willis said.Story continuesFeaturing a $200,000 cash award, the Don Tyson Prize for the Advancement of American Art was established by the Tyson family in honor of the late Don Tyson, former chairman and CEO of Tyson Foods. The biennial prize is awarded to living individuals or institutions in the U.S. working in any medium.“I am truly honored to be chosen to receive the prestigious Don Tyson Prize. I believe that the arts are essential in changing the world: by witnessing with reflection, uplifting diverse stories, and elevating multiple narratives of desire, pleasure and loss, I hope that my artistic practice, research and scholarship, teaching and mentoring advance justice and promote hope,” Willis said of the honor. “I am grateful that my work, in community with so many important colleagues and friends, is affirmed by, and recognized with this important prize.”Access and transformation are at the heart of the Don Tyson Prize for the Advancement of American Art. It was established in 2012 to identify and recognize individuals or organizations who have changed the way we look at, think about, or experience art. A jury of museum professionals and art historians empaneled by Crystal Bridges recommends an individual or institution for this recognition. Previous Don Tyson Prize recipients have made impacts through innovation, outside-the-box thinking and risk taking. In doing so, they’ve raised awareness, challenged preconceived notions, removed barriers and ultimately increased accessibility to art. The prize is the only one of its kind affiliated with Crystal Bridges.The Tyson family has a long-standing relationship with Crystal Bridges, including endowing the museum’s Tyson Scholars of American Art program. Tyson Foods Chairman and son of Don Tyson, John H. Tyson is also an original member of the Crystal Bridges board, and his daughter, Olivia Tyson, is involved with work at both Crystal Bridges and its contemporary art space satellite, the Momentary.“We are all in awe of the accomplishments of Deborah Willis, whose unique perspective and work behind the lens has given us a deeper understanding of the rich cultural histories surrounding the Black body, women and gender,” Olivia Tyson said. “I’m honored to have been involved in the process of selecting Dr. Willis as this year’s recipient of the Don Tyson Prize, strengthening my family’s. commitment to elevating and advancing outstanding achievements in American artists and institutions.”“Deborah Willis’ contributions have transformed the place of photography in American art, and her work embodies all that the Don Tyson Prize represents,” Tyson Foods Chairman John H. Tyson said. “My father believed in the power of American history and the American spirit, both of which Deb’s art explores and celebrates. The Tyson family is proud to partner with Crystal Bridges on awarding the prize to Dr. Willis.”The highly anticipated accolade returns after the 2020 prize was granted to Houston-based organization Project Row Houses. Previous recipients include Vanessa German (2018), a citizen artist whose art explores transformation through art and advocacy, and the Archives of American Art (2016), the first awardee of the Don Tyson Prize.To learn more about the Don Tyson Prize, past winners and Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, visit the website.About Crystal Bridges Museum of American ArtThe mission of Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art is to welcome all to celebrate the American spirit in a setting that unites the power of art with the beauty of nature. Since opening in 2011, the museum has welcomed more than 5.6 million visitors, with no cost for admission. Crystal Bridges was founded in 2005 as a non-profit charitable organization by arts patron and philanthropist, Alice Walton. The collection spans five centuries of American masterworks from early American to current day and is enhanced by temporary exhibitions. The museum is nestled on 120 acres of Ozark landscape and was designed by world-renowned architect Moshe Safdie. A rare Frank Lloyd Wright-designed house was preserved and relocated to the museum grounds in 2015.

Some 300,000 school children have participated in the Willard and Pat Walker School Visit program, which provides educational experiences for school groups at no cost to the schools. Additional museum amenities include a restaurant, gift store, library, and 5 miles of art and walking trails. In February 2020, the museum opened a satellite contemporary art space in downtown Bentonville called the Momentary (507 SE E Street). For more information, visit CrystalBridges.org.

This was followed by the European Central Bank also signaling that it will continue raising rates, with headline inflation continuing to trend above the bank’s target range.A batch of weak U.S. and euro zone economic data also showed that both economies are struggling under the yoke of high inflation and rising interest rates.Spot gold was flat around $1,776.15 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,787.05 an ounce by 19:07 ET (00:07 GMT). Both instruments slumped nearly 2% on Thursday.The yellow metal was also set to lose around 1.1% this week, rattled by a recovery in the dollar as investors sought safe haven in the greenback.Gold has largely lost its status as a safe haven this year, as rising U.S. interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. This saw the dollar largely overtake gold as the market’s favored safe haven, despite growing fears of a U.S. recession.Other precious metals were also subject to steep selling this week, given that the Fed’s comments blindsided investors hoping for a shift in the central bank’s hawkish rhetoric. Platinum futures were set to lose 2% this week, while silver futures were down 1.9%.Even so, a majority of investors are still pricing in a smaller, 25 basis point hike by the Fed in February.Among industrial metals, copper suffered deeper losses this week as rising COVID-19 infections in major importer China added another degree of uncertainty to markets already reeling from worsening growth prospects.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $3.7843 a pound, recovering slightly from a 2.5% tumble on Thursday. But the red metal was set to lose about 2.4% this week.While China’s relaxing of nationwide anti-COVID measures initially drove bids into copper, the resulting spike in infections swiftly culled any hopes for a quick reopening in the world’s largest copper importer.Still, the red metal is expected to benefit from an eventual reopening in the country next year.Related ArticlesGold fails to catch a bid above $1,800 as recession fears growOil rises, poised to end week higher despite economy concernsCalifornia regulators approve changes to rooftop solar policy]"

153,11133aaa-acde-3b16-8a86-e7d3b9ac7534,QCOM,2022-12-16,Is It Worth Investing in Qualcomm (QCOM) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-qualcomm-qcom-based-144302839.html,1671115382,STORY,['QCOM'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Qualcomm (QCOM).Qualcomm currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.74, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.74 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 11 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 64.7% and 5.9% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for QCOMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for QCOMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Qualcomm here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Qualcomm, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is QCOM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $10.19.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Qualcomm. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Qualcomm with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study QUALCOMM's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for QUALCOMM is:72% = US$13b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.72 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.QUALCOMM's Earnings Growth And 72% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that QUALCOMM has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 19% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 54% net income growth seen by QUALCOMM over the past five years isn't overly surprising.Story continuesWe then compared QUALCOMM's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 29% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is QCOM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is QUALCOMM Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?QUALCOMM's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 37%, meaning the company retains 63% of its income. So it seems that QUALCOMM is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, QUALCOMM has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 28% over the next three years. However, QUALCOMM's future ROE is expected to decline to 37% despite the expected decline in its payout ratio. We infer that there could be other factors that could be steering the foreseen decline in the company's ROE.SummaryIn total, we are pretty happy with QUALCOMM's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PulteGroup (PHM).PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 2.00, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 2.00 indicates Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, six are Strong Buy, representing 50% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying PulteGroup, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is PHM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $10.14.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $45 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Baxter International shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Baxter International is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Medical - Products industry that ranks in the Bottom 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while eight analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.01 per share to 94 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Baxter International right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 3.0%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Based on the last payment, WEC Energy Group's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 18.2%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 61% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $1.20, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.91. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 9.3% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that WEC Energy Group has grown earnings per share at 7.4% per year over the past five years. The lack of cash flows does make us a bit cautious though, especially when it comes to the future of the dividend.In SummaryIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think WEC Energy Group's payments are rock solid. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

The purchase had sparked a months-long proxy war between Icahn and Southwest that eventually settled with the ousting of former chief executive John Hester and three board seats being awarded to Icahn-appointed directors in May.Icahn had said the Questar deal hurts shareholders and referred to Hester and his management team as ""a great liability"".The company is weighing several options to recapitalize Centuri for the spin-off, it said during a call discussing the deals.

Qatar's regulator has grounded at least 29 of the jets, citing unanswered safety questions, over the past year.Airbus has acknowledged quality problems with its premier long-haul model but denies any risk to safety and has cancelled all outstanding new business with Qatar Airways, which has increased purchases from rival Boeing.On Friday, the two sides clashed angrily over access to the affected planes with Airbus lawyer David Wolfson complaining with the aid of photographs that its experts had been forced to photograph jets from a distance ""under the light of the moon"".He also accused the airline of engaging in a game of ""switcheroo"" to prevent its experts inspecting in-service jets.Qatar Airways strongly denied failing to cooperate with inspections and said it had given whatever access was practical to jets on short notice as it hosts the World Cup soccer tournament.""We do have to bear in mind that this is an operating airline,"" the carrier's lawyer Geraint Webb said.Story continuesWORLD CUP DIPLOMACYThe exchange - cut short by an apparently exasperated Waksman - is just one example of the breakdown in co-operation between Airbus and Qatar Airways, once a star customer and the first and largest buyer of Europe's premier long-haul jet.The hearings have focused attention on a disintegrating business relationship at the heart of the $150 billion jet industry, sprinkled with accusations of bad faith on both sides.Both sides have accused the other of colluding with their respective regulators, both of whom have declined to comment.The latest court confrontation comes as France's progression to the World Cup final in Qatar increases high-level contacts that have previously been seen as the opportunity to explore room for agreement. So far there are no signs of a settlement.French President Emmanuel Macron was welcomed at Doha airport on his arrival for Wednesday's semi-final by officials including Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, Qatar News Agency reported. He will also attend Sunday's final.The welcome by Al Baker in his capacity as minister of tourism is seen as a signal that the dispute is between companies rather than affecting strong diplomatic ties, though some diplomats have said politics may weigh on the outcome.Reuters reported last month that the dispute had risen to the attention of French and Qatari leaders, who discussed the issue last December during a previous visit by Macron to Doha.""Every time there is contact there is an opportunity to improve the atmosphere,"" one person familiar with the case said, though others warned the two sides remain far apart.(Additional reporting by Andrew MillsReporting by Tim HepherEditing by Mark Potter and Tomasz Janowski)]"

The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force.Rising Demand for Military Jets &amp; BoeingWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending rapidly to enhance their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe are already leading the defense market.It is imperative to mention in this context that military aircraft, both manned and unmanned, form an integral part of a country’s defense products. It is to be noted that the emerging trends in the combat aircraft space, like fifth-generation technology aircraft, advanced composite materials and stealth technology, have been substantially driving demand for military jets.The global military jet market is expanding, with North America leading this space. Boeing, being the largest jet maker in the United States, enjoys a dominant position. The company thus enjoys a frequent flow of contracts for military jets and associated upgrades. The latest contract win is a bright example.ProspectsPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during the 2022-2031 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. This can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities as well as increased spending on defense. This should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Textron TXT.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles, and related technologies.

On the other hand, JetBlue Airways’ JBLU management expects unit revenues for the December quarter to be at the low end of the previously guided range.United Airlines UAL was also in the news due to its fleet-modernization efforts, with management announcing that UAL will buy at least 100 787 Dreamliners from Boeing. With air-travel demand improving, Copa Holdings CPA reported upbeat traffic numbers for the month of November.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 Driven by upbeat air-travel demand, Delta expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating margin to be 11%, i.e. at the top of the previously guided 9-11% range. DAL now expects adjusted earnings per share in the $1.35-$1.40 range (the earlier outlook was in the range of $1-$1.25). Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 7-8% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the earlier outlook was for an increase in the 5-9% range). For full-year 2022, adjusted earnings are expected in the $3.07-$3.12 range. Meanwhile, full-year 2022 total revenues are expected in the $45.5-$45.6 billion range. Current-year operating margin is expected to be 7.7%. For full-year 2023, DAL expects 15-20% year-over-year revenue growth. Earnings per share and operating margin for full-year 2023 are expected in the $5-$6 band and 10-12% range, respectively. Free cash flow is anticipated to exceed $2 billion next year.

Alaska Air now expects fourth-quarter 2022 capacity to decline in the 7-9% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance called for a 7-10% decline). On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, ALK now expects fourth-quarter 2022 total revenues to increase 13-14% from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the previous guidance had hinted at a 12-15% increase). Moreover, ALK’s management aims to resume share buybacks early next year , following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act. Story continues3. In a bid to modernize its fleet, United Airlines placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more. UAL anticipates getting delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032. The new jets are expected to result in 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be placed. As a result of this massive deal, significant job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians, among others are also likely to be created.4. With hurricane Nicole impacting operations, close-in demand for the final month of the year has been weaker than expected, per JetBlue’s management. Apart from the hurricane, the holiday calendar timing this year had a greater-than-expected negative impact. As a result, JBLU now anticipates revenue per available seat mile for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be at the low end of its earlier guided range of a 15-19% increase from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.JBLU was also in the news recently due to its environmentally-friendly approach. That story was reported in detail in the previous week’s write-up.5. In November 2022, Copa Holdings’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 6.4% to 1.81 billion from the comparable period’s level in 2019. Increased passenger volume led to this upside. To match upbeat demand, CPA is increasing capacity — measured in available seat miles (ASMs) — which increased 4.6% from the November 2019 level to 2.08 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 150 basis points to 87% in November 2022.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this airplane builder have returned +9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, to which Boeing belongs, has gained 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Boeing is expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +105.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of -$8.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.93 indicates a change of +133.3% from what Boeing is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Boeing.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for BA _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Boeing, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $19.42 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +31.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.04 billion and $82.36 billion estimates indicate +6% and +24.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryBoeing reported revenues of $15.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.4%. EPS of -$6.18 for the same period compares with -$0.60 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.85%. The EPS surprise was -61700%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Boeing is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Boeing. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

186,0f68b2f4-55ca-3d54-9397-98d78aeb3131,ILMN,2022-12-16,FOCUS-Cancer researchers question antitrust arguments against Illumina-Grail deal,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-cancer-researchers-antitrust-arguments-120000659.html,1671192000,STORY,['ILMN'],"[By Deena Beasley and Julie SteenhuysenLOS ANGELES/CHICAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - U.S. and European antitrust enforcers want to unwind gene sequencing leader Illumina Inc's purchase of cancer test company Grail, saying the two would stifle competition in a critical area of medicine, but some cancer researchers say it's far too early to make that assessment.Illumina is the leading maker of high-speed genomic sequencing systems that can examine fragments of DNA found in blood or other samples for use in everything from solving crimes to drug research.Antitrust regulators argue that Illumina, whose sequencers are being used by companies, hospitals and research centers, could unfairly prioritize Grail in the race to create tests for the early detection of multiple types of cancer. Illumina could raise prices or withhold the technology competing test developers need to thrive.But Reuters interviews with 13 cancer researchers, genomics experts and potential competitors to Grail and Illumina show the field of winners and losers among early detection cancer test makers is still far from decided, suggesting the $7.1 billion deal won't strengthen Grail's hand as much as regulators fear.In court documents, competition enforcers cite concerns from Grail rivals about being disadvantaged by the tie-up.Exact Sciences Corp and six other companies testified in the U.S. that they relied on Illumina's system. The Illumina system is more advanced than others and switching too costly, they said.At the same time, Grail is the only company with a blood test designed to detect multiple early-stage cancers on the market, giving it a first-mover advantage with doctors prescribing the tests. However, it does not have regulatory approval and likely needs a lot more data to prove it works.""The jury is still out,"" on which technology will dominate, said Dr. Sadik Esener, director of the Cancer Early Detection Advanced Research Center at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute in Portland, Oregon. He added it could take as long as 20 years to show that an early cancer detection test saved lives.Story continuesThe EU has ordered Illumina to sell Grail, a move the company plans to appeal.""While there is still uncertainty about the exact results of this innovation race and the future shape of the market for early cancer detection tests, protecting this current innovation competition is crucial,"" an EU Commission spokesperson said.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has lost its case to stop the deal and is appealing the decision. The FTC declined to comment. In court documents, the agency said the deal, even in the early days of competition before a clear commercial market is established, will diminish innovation.""Right now Grail is the only one on the market. In antitrust, we tend to give outsized importance to the one on the market,"" said Michael Carrier, who teaches antitrust law at Rutgers Law School. Still, he noted ""thoughts about their role being diminished in the future is speculative.""Esener, who uses gene sequencing machines from Illumina and Pacific Biosciences of California (PacBio) for research looking to detect liver cancer in its earliest stages, noted the field of early cancer detection is diverse, with about 30 companies working on five different methods of testing for signs of very early cancer – including the types Grail and its rivals are focused on.If proven to work, early cancer detection tests could help doctors identify cancer risk in patients long before symptoms or other indicators develop.DIFFERENT APPROACHESSeveral of the leading contenders take vastly different approaches to cancer detection and it is not yet clear which methods will prove most useful or when. Large, lengthy clinical trials are also needed to show the tests can benefit patients, experts say.“All of the published data to date suggests promise, but nothing more than that,” said Dr. Ernest Hawk at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.Companies that make sequencing systems that compete with Illumina include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Ultima Genomics Inc and 10x Genomics.Each group pursuing a test uses a different approach. Grail's Galleri test uses genetic sequencing and artificial intelligence to scan blood samples for patterns of chemical changes associated with specific cancers. Delfi Diagnostics Inc is using machine learning to analyze cancer DNA in the blood and is focused on early detection of only a handful of common cancers such as lung cancer. Guardant Health has been working on a blood test to detect colorectal cancer using a combination of DNA alterations and other biomarkers.Other cancer test developers don't rely on gene sequencing at all. Some are working on blood tests to detect different markers of early cancer, including proteins.Until evidence proves that early detection is viable, tests could come and go, researchers said, with companies selling them to paying patients while trials are ongoing.

Yet, it is far from the Federal Reserves’ ambitious target of 2% for a strong economy.November’s services sector PMI data, provided by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), jumped to 56.5% from 54.4% in October, indicating exceptional growth. At the same time, the employment level increased to 263,000 jobs for November, and the average hourly income rose 0.6% for the month, up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. The above data suggest that the Fed’s efforts to check inflation by drying the liquidity and slowing down the labor market are ineffective.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has continued with a hawkish monetary policy by a 0.5 basis point increase in overnight interest rate, marking its seventh hike in 2022. The cumulative interest is now in the range of 4.25-4.5%, making it the maximum since 1980. The chair has mentioned that the Fed will continue to increase its rate in the New Year as long it’s needed to meet the inflation goal.Global geopolitical tensions, especially the Russia-Ukraine war, which resulted in global oil and gas scarcity during winter, are leaving indirect impacts on the supply-chain disruptions. A fresh COVID-19 breakout in China forced the authorities to impose restrictions in several cities in China, shrinking businesses and consumer activity. Such situations have impacted business around the world and aggravated volatility in the stock market.Story continuesThus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in matured businesses with regular dividend payout. These dividend stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Investors can expect a regular flow of income along with the preservation of capital against unexpected price changes. It is often seen that a company, which tends to reward its investors with a high dividend payout, comparatively outperforms non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like Lamb Weston LW, Nucor NUE, Quanta Services PWR, Toro TTC, and Amgen AMGN that have lately hiked their dividend payments.Lamb Weston is an Eagle, ID-based company.

189,1ec3dbbc-552e-3914-8550-635ed19763d3,MAA,2022-12-16,Analysts Just Upgraded These 3 REITs,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-upgraded-3-reits-161831912.html,1671121111,STORY,"['MAA-PI', 'PEAK', 'UDR']","[Many real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks that were trounced throughout much of 2022 have shown much-improved price performance over the past two months. But analysts have been slow to upgrade the sector, citing ongoing interest-rate hikes and fears of a recession in 2023.That may be changing, especially if the Federal Reserve begins to taper down on its rate hikes as Chairman Jerome Powell indicated could happen. Take a look at three REITs that have seen analyst upgrades within the past few weeks:Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is a Germantown, Tennessee-based residential REIT whose specialty is purchasing and leasing apartment complexes. Mid-America Apartment Communities owns over 101,000 units in 296 communities across 16 states and Washington, D.C. Most of Mid-America Apartment Communities’ properties are located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic states.This past week, Goldman Sachs analyst Chandni Luthra upgraded Mid-America Apartment Communities from Neutral to Buy, while raising her previous price target from $178 to $194.Mid-America Apartment Communities has an annual dividend of $5, which yields 3%. The 52-week range is $141.13 to $231.63, and the most recent closing price was $163.62. This represents a potential upside of 19.2% to the analyst’s new target price.UDR Inc. (NYSE: UDR) is another residential REIT that owns, leases and manages 58,464 apartment units across 13 states plus Washington, D.C. UDR, formerly known as United Dominion Realty Trust, is based in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, and has been in business for over 50 years. It was added to the S&amp;P 500 in 2016.At the beginning of December, analyst Adam Kramer of Morgan Stanley upgraded UDR from Equal-Weight to Overweight. At the same time he chose to lower his price target from $49 to $47.UDR has an annual dividend of $1.52, which yields 3.7%. The 52-week price range is $37.18 to $61.06. Its most recent closing price was $40.30, and that represents 17% of potential upside from here.Story continuesHealthpeak Properties Inc. (NYSE: PEAK) is a Denver-based healthcare REIT that owns and operates private-pay facilities such as life science centers, medical offices and senior housing. The company was added to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008.Healthpeak Properties owns 464 properties in Colorado, Tennessee and California valued at more than $20 billion. Its diversification of property types helps Healthpeak reduce the risks of a recession. Many of Healthpeak Properties’ life science tenants are large, well-known pharmaceuticals, such as Amgen Inc, Pfizer Inc and Bristol Myers Squibb Co.Analyst Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI Group recently upgraded Healthpeak Properties from In-Line to Outperform, simultaneously initiating a $28 price target.Healthpeak Properties has an annual dividend of $1.20 yielding 4.7%. The 52-week price range for Healthpeak Properties is $21.41 to $36.85. From its most recent closing price of $25.30, that represents a potential upside of 10%.Although analyst upgrades can propel stocks higher, investors should keep in mind that analysts are not always right. Many of them have at best a 50% overall success rate. Investors are urged to always do their own due diligence before purchasing any stock.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

190,31b70b37-1e46-3465-aa0f-63172779ac5c,MAA,2022-12-16,Mid-America Apartment (MAA) Shares Up 6.1% QTD: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mid-america-apartment-maa-shares-142602866.html,1671114362,STORY,['MAA-PI'],"[Shares of Mid-America Apartment Communities MAA — commonly known as MAA — have risen 6.1% so far in the quarter, outperforming the industry’s increase of just 0.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis residential REIT is engaged in owning, managing, acquiring, developing and redeveloping quality apartment communities, mainly in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. MAA recently announced a common stock cash dividend of $1.40 per share, marking a 12% hike over the prior payment and the 13th consecutive annual increase in the company’s dividend.MAA is also experiencing a favorable estimate revision trend. Estimates for fourth-quarter and current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share have moved north over the past month to $2.28 and $8.46, respectively.There are several other factors behind the surge in the stock price and upward estimate revisions for FFO per share. Let us delve deeper.MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio was less severely affected by the pandemic and the economic shutdown. Rather, the pandemic has accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.Also, the high pricing of single-family ownership units continues to drive the demand for rental apartments. Amid this, MAA is well-poised to capture recovery in demand and leasing compared to expensive coastal markets. We expect strong rent growth and stable occupancy to drive revenues.This Sunbelt-focused apartment REIT opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. MAA projects development investments of $200 to $250 million and acquisitions of $213 million for 2022. Such efforts are likely to improve portfolio quality and propel the company’s growth over the long term.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs will help the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.The company completed 2,305 interior unit upgrades and installed 652 Smart Home packages in the third quarter. In 2022, the company plans to complete more than 6,000 interior unit upgrades and approximately 23,000 Smart Home packages. By the end of the year, management projects the total number of smart units to reach 70,000.For its repositioning program, leases have been repriced at the first eight properties in the program. Meanwhile, the company has another eight projects, which are presently in various stages of construction and unit repricing.Along with the healthy operating fundamentals of Sunbelt markets and a robust development pipeline, the prospects of MAA’s redevelopment program and progress in technology measures are likely to drive margin expansion.MAA’s current cash flow growth is projected at 39.17% compared with the 14.86% growth projected for the industry. Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 10.60% compares favorably with the industry’s 4.78%, reflecting that MAA is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.However, inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes are expected to push property operating expenses higher. Also, rate hikes add to its woes.MAA currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties Inc. VICI and Lamar Advertising Company LAMR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for VICI Properties’ 2022 FFO per share has moved 3.2% north to $1.92 over the past month.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lamar Advertising Company’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has been raised 1.4% over the past two months to $7.34.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more best dividend stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. Although not always the case, many dividend stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis as a way to return a share of their profits back to the owners. Given that a company's profit can increase or decrease depending on various factors, a company's dividend can also increase or decrease.2022 has been a challenging year for many companies given the higher inflation and the rising interest rates. As a result, many stocks have not done well this year and the market as a whole has declined. In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.2% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 6.77%, and the NASDAQ has retreated 28.9% in 2022 as of December 13.While the market hasn't done well, a percentage of the leading dividend stocks have outperformed the market this year. Some leading dividend stocks have outperformed because their businesses have pricing power and competitive advantages that make them relatively resistant to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. Other leading dividend stocks have rallied given investors expect their earnings per share to grow substantially in the future.Of the leading dividend stocks that have outperformed this year, many have increased their annual dividends to return even more capital back to shareholders.2023While November's core inflation data was lower than expected, many analysts still think the Federal Reserve will still raise interest rates further and that there is still a likely probability of a recession in 2023. According to a monthly survey of around 300 institutional investors who represent trillions in funds, for instance, 82% thought recession was the 'most likely' scenario in the coming months.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many stocks across many different sectors.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the S&amp;P 500's performance in 2022 that also had a dividend yield of over 1% as of December 13.We then ranked the dividend stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

As a result of the increases, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has a dividend yield of 3.65% as of December 13, which when added to its year to date return of 3.8% yields a fairly attractive return given that the S&amp;P 500 declined 16.2% in the year.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 26 were long Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #12 on our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Alongside McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Walmart Inc.

(NYSE:QSR)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.84%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 3.21%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), the owner of Burger King, has outperformed the market given its year to date rally of 11.84% and its dividend yield of 3.21%.Although inflation has been a headwind for many companies this year, the higher prices have not affected Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) given the company's strong earnings. For Q3, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) reported EPS of $1.17 on sales of $1.73 billion versus the consensus of $0.80 on revenue of $1.66 billion. Q3 global comparable sales rose 9% year over year.10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 10.68%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 4.38%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a tech stock that has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ, which are down 16.2% and 28.9% in 2022, respectively. Given its rally of 10.68%, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has also outperformed many big tech companies too.One potential reason for the strong performance could be International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) expects free cash flow of around $10 billion this year which makes its dividend yield of 4.38% relatively safe if the company can maintain or grow the metric in the future.9. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.28%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 0.95%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) is a leading railroad whose stock has rallied 11.28% this year given increasing demand. For Q3 2022, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 while total revenues increased 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) also has a dividend yield of 0.95% as of 12/13.Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8.

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 36.33%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the better performing dividend stocks in 2022 given its surge of 36.33% year to date.

Often, the first company that comes to mind when consumers think of buying shoes is Nike.With Nike shares still trading 37% from their highs, now might be a great time for investors to consider buying NKE for 2023 and beyond. Going over Nike’s fundamentals will help gauge if a rebound is in store.Recent Performance The Zacks Shoe &amp; Retail Apparel Industry is down -32% in 2022, with some of the most notable names in the space being Nike, Adidas ADDYY, and Skechers SKY. Nike’s -36% YTD performance is right in the middle of its popular peers, beating Adidas’s -56% but lagging Skechers -4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNike’s total return is +76% over the last five years, to beat Skecher’s +10% and Adidas’s -38%. This also topped the Shoes &amp; Retail Apparel Markets +48% and the benchmark.  Checking Nike’s valuation over this period may give a better indication of if now is a great long-term buying opportunity or not.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation Nike shares currently trade at 37.5X forward earnings at around $108 a share. This is a 31% discount from its five-year high of 54.3X and closer to the median of 32.6X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a price-to-earnings perspective, NKE’s valuation is starting to look intriguing. Investors may want to also gauge the price to sales they pay for retail and apparel stocks as well. In this regard, Nike looks attractive as well as there is not a high premium being paid for shares of the industry leader.NKE trades at 3.7X P/S which is 41% below its five-year high of 6.5X and right at the median. Even better, Nike trades modestly above the current industry average of 3.3X and not at a far-stretched premium.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; OutlookNike earnings are expected to drop -21% in its current fiscal 2023 at $2.97 per share. FY24 EPS is expected to rebound and jump 26% to $3.76 per share. It is important to note that estimate revisions have declined over the last 90 days for both FY23 and FY24.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are forecasted to rise 5% in FY23 and another 8% in FY24 to $52.92 billion. FY24 sales would represent 35% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $39.11 billion.Considering its valuation, from a growth perspective Nike could be poised for a 2023 rebound despite dealing with a tougher operating environment for most companies.Bottom Line Nike stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors may be rewarded for holding the stock with shares starting to look attractive from a valuation standpoint. Growth is also expected to continue as the company adjusts to the economic downturn.Plus, Nike has a strong balance sheet and offers a modest 1.2% annual dividend yield to support its shareholders.

It is worth considering Nike (NKE), which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry.This athletic apparel maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.65%.For the last reported quarter, Nike came out with earnings of $0.93 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.91 per share, representing a surprise of 2.20%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.90 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.11%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Nike. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Nike has an Earnings ESP of +1.09% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on December 20, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Nike (NKE) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.66 a share five days away from its upcoming earnings release on December 20, 2022.Nike's Earnings ESP sits at 1.09%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.66 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.65.NKE is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Caesars Entertainment (CZR).Caesars Entertainment is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 28, 2023. CZR's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.15 a share 75 days from its next earnings release.Story continuesFor Caesars Entertainment, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13 is 19.32%.NKE and CZR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying.Insider buying is a popular way to assess the potential of a company and can be a good indicator to gauge a stock's performance. When insiders, such as corporate officers, directors and large shareholders, buy shares of their own company, it is often seen as a sign of confidence in the future of the company. It is important to note that insider buying does not guarantee future success, but it can be a helpful indicator when researching potential investments.When looking for companies with insider buying activity, investors should focus on the size and frequency of the purchases. Insiders are required to disclose any stock purchases in regulatory filings, so investors can easily track this activity. It is important to note, however, that some insiders may be buying stock for a variety of reasons and not necessarily because they believe the stock will increase in value.Investors should also consider other factors such as the company’s fundamentals, financial health and industry trends when making investment decisions. While insider buying can be an important indicator of a company’s potential, it should not be the sole factor used when making an investment decision. Investors should also consider the company’s overall strategy and position in the market.2022 has shaken investors' confidence and proven to be a difficult year for equities. As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has lost over 15% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 28.5% for the year, and the Dow has shed 6% since the beginning of 2022. In the midst of strong inflation, high interest rates, supply disruptions, and inventory gluts, investors are left puzzled about where to park cash. In times like these, it may be useful to look at where the masses are pouring into, what stocks are on smart money's radars, and also what corporate executives have faith in their business.

However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation(NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”13.

201,54942eab-5f16-3dd7-900a-954672a384d5,ZION,2022-12-16,What Does Hawkish Fed Mean for Banks Heading Into 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-hawkish-fed-mean-banks-131401600.html,1671110041,STORY,"['BAC', 'HBAN', 'BOKF', 'JPM', 'ZIONP']","[The Federal Reserve has raised the interest rates by 50 basis points. The Fed fund rates now stand in the 4.25% to 4.50% range, the highest since December 2007. This was expected. But what wasn’t expected by the market participants was the central bank asserting more tightening in 2023 while signaling a rise in the unemployment rate and a near stalling of economic growth.The Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at the press conference, following the conclusion of the two-day FOMC meeting, said, “We still have some ways to go.” He further added, ““I wouldn’t see us considering rate cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustained way. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.”The Fed officials now anticipate the interest rates to reach 5.1% by 2023-end (up from the previously projected 4.6% in September) before coming down to 4.1% and 3.1% by 2024 and 2025, respectively. As interest income constitutes a major portion of banks’ revenues, higher interest rates, along with decent loan demand, will offer support. Hence, banks like JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Huntington Bancshares HBAN, BOK Financial Corporation BOKF and Zions Bancorporation ZION are expected to witness solid top-line improvement.When the Fed cut short-term interest rates to near-zero in March 2020 amid the pandemic, banks witnessed net interest margin (NIM) compression. Now, with the central bank raising rates, banks including JPM, BAC, HBAN, ZION and BOKF are expected to continue recording an increase in the NIM going forward.Despite this favorable development, there is a cause for concern for banks as the Fed offered a very grim economic picture while reiterating its aggressive stance to bring inflation down. The inflation is cooling down, with the November reading of 7.1% marking a second straight monthly fall.But the path to bring down inflation to its target will inflict some pain on the economy. Per the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, the U.S. economy will be slowing down considerably next year, with just 0.5% growth compared with the previous expectation of 1.2% growth.Banks’ financials are tied to the health of the economy. As the economy slows down and demand for loans wanes, banks’ earnings are likely to be adversely impacted. This will present a huge challenge for banks like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Huntington Bancshares, BOK Financial and Zions.So, for banks, the situation will be like a double-edged sword. But this shouldn’t drive the investors away from bank stocks. Over the past decade, several operating efficiency-strengthening initiatives and stringent regulatory capital requirements have made banks fundamentally stronger. Banks have moved away from risky operations and are now focused on bolstering core businesses.A conservative lending policy, higher interest rates and a strong balance sheet position will keep supporting banks. Global diversification and changing the mix to focus more on other revenue sources, along with technological advancements, will continue aiding financials.Undoubtedly, the operating environment will get tough for banks in 2023. But investors must not shy away from investing in banking stocks that are fundamentally strong and have long-term prospects. At the same time, they must keep their eyes open for any near-term headwinds.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

204,fcb3a98f-90f0-3036-a0b9-537d9c7f3e88,WFC,2022-12-16,Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 74% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargo-company-nyse-wfc-140043575.html,1671112843,STORY,['WFC-PD'],"[Every investor in Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 74% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Wells Fargo, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Wells Fargo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Wells Fargo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.6% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.9% and 4.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$95m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Wells Fargo. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Wells Fargo .Ultimately the future is most important.

The study evaluated IVX-121, its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, in adults aged 18 years and older.Data from the study showed that a single dose administration of IVX-121 (without adjuvant) generated a sustained neutralizing antibody (nAb) response against RSV, which lasted for at least six months. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) against RSV-A at day 180 were maintained at 64-98% of the GMTs reported at day 28 in older adults. The pattern of durability for the RSV vaccine was also comparable in both young and older adult groups.Though the GMTs for RSV-B showed greater variability, they were maintained above baseline through day 180.The rise in share price was attributable to better-than-expected results from the phase I/Ib study. Investors cheered the news as the GMTs maintained at 64-98% appeared to be better than its competitors like Pfizer PFE and GSK GSK, whose RSV vaccine candidates are currently under FDA review.In the year so far, Icosavax’s stock has lost 61.0% compared with the industry’s 17.6% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe phase I portion of the study evaluated the RSV vaccine in younger adults aged 18 through 45 years, while the phase Ib portion of the study evaluated the RSV vaccine in older adults aged 60 through 75 years. The study evaluated the RSV vaccine at three different dose levels — 25-µg, 75-µg and 250-µg.The vaccine was reported safe and durable across both age groups and participants who received IVX-121 did not report any serious adverse events.Icosavax plans to present additional data from the above study at a future medical meeting. Management also intends to report the 12-month immunogenicity data from the phase Ib portion of the study in mid-2023.Earlier this month, Pfizer announced that its regulatory filing with the FDA seeking approval for its RSV vaccine candidate, RSVpreF, was granted priority review by the FDA. Pfizer’s filing seeks a review for the use of RSVpreF in older adults aged at least 60 years for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTI). A final FDA decision on Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is expected by May 2023.Story continuesRSVPreF3, GSK’s RSV vaccine for older adults, is also under FDA priority review, with a decision expected in May 2023. Regulatory applications seeking approval of GSK’s RSV vaccine are under review in Japan and Europe as well.Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines against RSV infections. If approved, either Pfizer or GSK’s vaccines may be the first approved RSV vaccine in the United States. Older adults are at maximum risk of getting RSV disease.Apart from IVX-121, Icosavax is also evaluating IVX-A12, a bivalent vaccine that combines IVX-121 for RSV and IVX-241 for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), in an ongoing phase I study. With IVX-A12, Icosavax aims to target two causes of pneumonia in one combination. Topline data from this study is expected in mid-2023.Icosavax, Inc. PriceIcosavax, Inc.

Price and ConsensusPayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. Quote Growing Crypto EffortsThe latest move bodes well for the company’s strengthening crypto initiatives.Apart from the latest move, PayPal offers a feature called crypto on Venmo, which lets Venmo customers buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly within the Venmo app. Customers can also check cryptocurrency trends from the app.Further, the company offers its cryptocurrency service in the United Kingdom, which allows users to buy, hold and sell digital currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Litecoin directly from their PayPal accounts. PayPal’s acquisition of a digital asset security technology provider — Curv — remains noteworthy.The unveiling of a feature called Checkout with Crypto, which allows customers to seamlessly convert their cryptocurrency holdings into fiat currency at the checkout, is another positive.With all these endeavors, PayPal remains well-poised to penetrate the booming cryptocurrency market rapidly amid the pandemic, which has highlighted the importance of digital currency transactions.Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.2% between 2022 and 2030.Story continuesCompetitive ScenarioWe note that the latest move, along with the above-mentioned efforts, is likely to strengthen PayPal’s competitive position against one of its biggest peers, Block SQ.Block facilitates the buying and selling of bitcoins via its Cash App. It also intends to develop a bitcoin mining system, with the help of which it strives to carry out the processes of mining, maintaining, setting up and purchasing bitcoin efficiently.Apart from Square, Shopify SHOP is also leaving no stone unturned to gain a strong foothold in the cryptocurrency space.Shopify allows its merchants to accept payments in bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies. It recently took a step further in the crypto market by making its platform NFT-enabled, which allows users to mint and trade collectibles.Nevertheless, PayPal’s strong crypto initiatives and the growing crypto volume are likely to strengthen its position in the intensifying cryptocurrency battle against the above-mentioned companies.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector can consider a better-ranked stock like Arista Networks ANET, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

(NASDAQ:PYPL). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings PayPal Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$97.82 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$72.63. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Peggy Alford was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$3.7m for 33.36k shares. But insiders sold 21.79k shares worth US$2.1m. Overall, PayPal Holdings insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. PayPal Holdings insiders own about US$103m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At PayPal Holdings Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded PayPal Holdings shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like PayPal Holdings insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PayPal Holdings.

219,5cfa70eb-6143-3c8d-a477-199f2a13ccf4,IBM,2022-12-16,Should You Be Concerned About International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) ROE?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/concerned-international-business-machines-corporations-120101346.html,1671192061,STORY,['IBM'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for International Business Machines is:6.8% = US$1.4b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.07 in profit.Does International Business Machines Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, International Business Machines has a lower ROE than the average (15%) in the IT industry.roeThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for International Business Machines by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Story continuesHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Combining International Business Machines' Debt And Its 6.8% Return On EquityInternational Business Machines clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.52. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: International Business Machines may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 8% loss over the past four weeks.Agilysys extended its rally, driven by its expertise in enterprise architecture, infrastructure optimization, storage and resource management, as well as business continuity. Further, its recent agreement with Marriott International regarding the deployment of its cloud-native property management system software across the latter’s luxury, premium and selected service hotels located in the United States and Canada over the coming years, remains a positive.This software provider for the lodging and leisure sectors is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.3%. Revenues are expected to be $48.1 million, up 21.9% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Agilysys, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best-Performing Technology ETFs in 2022.Tech has lagged all year round in 2022, with the Nasdaq tumbling 29.62% year to date as of December 12. Tech stocks have been the victim of high interest rates, high inflation, and huge sell-offs. Investors have restructured their portfolios towards value and more defensive sectors to hedge against inflation and interest rate hikes.""2022 is a Year to Forget For Tech""On December 6, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where he discussed his overview and outlook for the tech sector. Thill noted that 2022 has been a rough year for tech stocks and he sees further downside as we head into the first half of 2023. Here are some comments from Thill:""We're facing a recession, Jefferies global strategists and economists believe that there is no way we can hit a soft landing. So fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a hard landing. It's going to take time for the industry to recover. What, right now, I think what's happening is many of these companies have over forecasted on the top line and that's not coming in. And now, they're having to cut expenses, they're having to cut on employees, they're actually slowing their hiring, and this is going to last into the front half of '23.""Brent Thill further said that ""stocks look ahead"" and so ""the next signpost will probably be some time mid-next year in '23"". Thill noted that ""as tech investors look at '24 numbers, we will start to see hopefully numbers reaccelerate into '24"". Brent Thill expects a further 10% to 20% downside from current levels, after which we will have ""the all-clear sign, as we can look at '24 and we can look at a potential re-acceleration"" in tech.While tech stocks are getting hammered, investors can still increase their exposure to tech in a relatively less-risky way.  Investing in technology exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great way to gain exposure to the technology sector in a diversified, low-cost and tax-efficient manner. Technology ETFs offer investors a way to gain broad exposure to the technology sector, including technology hardware, software, semiconductors, communications and internet-related industries.Story continuesInvesting in technology ETFs can help tech investors gain exposure to big-tech in a risk-efficient manner due to the diversification and low-cost structure ETFs offer. Some of the best-in-class names investors can gain exposure to via technology ETFs include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). This piece will focus on the best performing technology ETFs in 2022.Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur MethodologyWe screened for technology ETFs and reviewed their year-to-date returns, as of December 12. We picked the best performing ETFs from among them and ranked them in increasing order of their year-to-date returns. Even though these ETFs have lost value year to date, they have outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which we have used as a benchmark for this piece. Along with each ETF, we have mentioned the underlying index it tracks, the technique used, its portfolio breakdown, and top holdings.Best Performing Technology ETFs in 202210. iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK)YTD Return as of December 12: -23.38%The iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK) employs a representative sampling technique to mirror the performance of the NYSE FactSet Global Cyber Security Index. The fund has $520 million in assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.47%. The fund has lost 23.38% year to date, as of December 12, and has outperformed the Nasdaq by over 5%. The fund is therefore placed among the best performing technology ETFs in 2022.The iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:IHAK) has 56 holdings concentrated in the technology and industrials segments. The fund has a top ten holdings concentration of 49.28%. One of the fund's top ten holdings is Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), a cloud security company worth $17.47 billion as of December 9.On December 2, MKM Partners analyst Catharine Trebnick revised her price target on Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) to $180 from $190 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares.As of September 30, D E Shaw is the top investor in Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) and has stakes worth $189.90 million.Here is what Artisan Partners had to say about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our notable adds in the quarter included Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) , Etsy and BioNTech. Zscaler provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. The company recently delivered 61% revenue growth and expects to grow nearly 40% in 2023 (ahead of expectations). Despite solid fundamental momentum, shares have underperformed this year as investors have grown concerned about slowing demand for enterprise software as the broader global economy slows. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments alike as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. From 2018 to 2020, losses from cybercrimes grew 67% to $1 trillion, and some estimate it could reach $10 trillion by 2025. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (Office 365, Salesforce, etc.) and a more remote workforce (versus pre-pandemic) make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. Zscaler’s scalable, cloud-based security platform is a more secure and efficient way to connect users and applications, which eliminates the need for several layers of security (firewalls, VPNs, etc.) developed and built over the last couple of decades. For these reasons and with shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we added to our position.”Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) is rising in popularity among elite money managers.9. VanEck Israel ETF (NYSEARCA:ISRA)YTD Return as of December 12: -22.49%The VanEck Vectors Israel ETF (NYSEARCA:ISRA) has fallen by roughly 22.5% year to date, as of December 12, but is one of the best performing technology ETFs in 2022 since it has outperformed the Nasdaq by over 6%.

If you want to see more best dividend stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. Although not always the case, many dividend stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis as a way to return a share of their profits back to the owners. Given that a company's profit can increase or decrease depending on various factors, a company's dividend can also increase or decrease.2022 has been a challenging year for many companies given the higher inflation and the rising interest rates. As a result, many stocks have not done well this year and the market as a whole has declined. In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.2% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 6.77%, and the NASDAQ has retreated 28.9% in 2022 as of December 13.While the market hasn't done well, a percentage of the leading dividend stocks have outperformed the market this year. Some leading dividend stocks have outperformed because their businesses have pricing power and competitive advantages that make them relatively resistant to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. Other leading dividend stocks have rallied given investors expect their earnings per share to grow substantially in the future.Of the leading dividend stocks that have outperformed this year, many have increased their annual dividends to return even more capital back to shareholders.2023While November's core inflation data was lower than expected, many analysts still think the Federal Reserve will still raise interest rates further and that there is still a likely probability of a recession in 2023. According to a monthly survey of around 300 institutional investors who represent trillions in funds, for instance, 82% thought recession was the 'most likely' scenario in the coming months.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many stocks across many different sectors.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the S&amp;P 500's performance in 2022 that also had a dividend yield of over 1% as of December 13.We then ranked the dividend stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 202212. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 3.80%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 3.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a leading pharmaceutical company based in Switerzerland that has increased its annual dividend per share for 25 straight years since its creation in 1996. As a result of the increases, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has a dividend yield of 3.65% as of December 13, which when added to its year to date return of 3.8% yields a fairly attractive return given that the S&amp;P 500 declined 16.2% in the year.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 26 were long Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #12 on our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Alongside McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a dividend stock that has outperformed the market in 2022.11. Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.84%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 3.21%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), the owner of Burger King, has outperformed the market given its year to date rally of 11.84% and its dividend yield of 3.21%.Although inflation has been a headwind for many companies this year, the higher prices have not affected Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) given the company's strong earnings. For Q3, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) reported EPS of $1.17 on sales of $1.73 billion versus the consensus of $0.80 on revenue of $1.66 billion. Q3 global comparable sales rose 9% year over year.10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 10.68%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 4.38%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a tech stock that has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ, which are down 16.2% and 28.9% in 2022, respectively. Given its rally of 10.68%, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has also outperformed many big tech companies too.One potential reason for the strong performance could be International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) expects free cash flow of around $10 billion this year which makes its dividend yield of 4.38% relatively safe if the company can maintain or grow the metric in the future.9. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.28%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 0.95%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) is a leading railroad whose stock has rallied 11.28% this year given increasing demand. For Q3 2022, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 while total revenues increased 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) also has a dividend yield of 0.95% as of 12/13.Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8. Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 4.24%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 1.69%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) is another Canadian railroad that has outperformed the market given strong demand. As a result of stronger fundamentals, Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) stock has rallied 4.24% year to date while the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.2% over the same period.42 owned shares of Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) at the end of September, ranking the stock #8 on our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.7. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 36.33%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the better performing dividend stocks in 2022 given its surge of 36.33% year to date. With the Ukraine Russia war, it is likely U.S. defense spending will likely continue to increase and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could potentially benefit if it maintains its market share.Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) certainty has substantial technical expertise given it is the maker of the B-21, which is the successor to the B-2. The company has a dividend yield of 1.32% as of December 13.6.

(PRNewsfoto/IBM)Building on IBM's mission to reduce risk for the industry with security, compliance and resiliency at the forefront, the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services is designed to help clients automate their security and compliance posture. The framework is central to IBM Cloud for Financial Services, a first-of-its-kind cloud with built-in security and compliance controls to help clients as they work to mitigate risk, tackle ongoing regulations and accelerate cloud adoption. It has been mapped to the Cloud Security Alliance's Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) – a cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing, which can help clients to drive innovation faster while addressing third and fourth party risk in cloud. With the alignment, organizations that have adopted CSA's controls can now use services or transact with SaaS providers on IBM Cloud for Financial Services with confidence.""As global regulations continue to evolve, it's critical for all organizations to adhere to changing requirements while operating in a secured cloud environment – but this is even more critical for highly regulated industries such as financial services,"" said Jim Reavis, CEO of Cloud Security Alliance. ""With its long history and deep expertise working with some of the world's most well-known financial services organizations on their modernization journeys, IBM understands the importance of establishing a highly secured hybrid, multicloud architecture that can allow organizations to host workloads wherever they need to be. Together, we aim to help financial services organizations drive growth and reduce systemic risk with a more secured cloud landscape and by empowering them to address evolving regulations globally – from DORA to data sovereignty.Story continuesCollective intelligence aims to reduce financial services risk  Designed specifically for financial regulated industries, IBM Cloud for Financial Services was introduced in 2019 in collaboration with partner banks including Bank of America and BNP Paribas. It aims to help financial services organizations address the industry's unique cybersecurity, regulatory and operational requirements, while providing the benefits and flexibility of the cloud in a secured environment.Leveraging the collective intelligence of the IBM Financial Services Cloud Council – a network of more than 120 financial services CIOs, CTOs, and Risk and Compliance officers such as Banco Bradesco, Nationwide, Banco Sabadell, Virgin Money and MUFG – the platform includes industry-informed and built-in controls that can help financial institutions meet their security and compliance requirements of this highly regulated industry. These industry-informed controls are not IBM's – they are the industry's collective controls. While IBM Cloud has implemented these controls as part of IBM Cloud for Financial Services, it has also made them available for clients to use on multiple clouds (public or private) – through managing workloads with IBM Cloud Satellite and monitoring their compliance through the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center.""As organizations strive to keep up with the latest regulatory requirements and evolving data sovereignty laws, security and compliance are at the core of our approach. We are on a mission to be the world's most secure, stable and resilient cloud, which is why many of the world's major financial services organizations have worked with us over multiple decades,"" said Howard Boville, Head of IBM Cloud Platform. ""IBM Cloud for Financial Services is specifically designed for highly regulated workloads, allowing financial services and other regulated industries to host applications and workloads in the cloud with confidence while addressing third and fourth party risk throughout their supply chains. As we continue our mission to help reduce risk in financial services, through our work with the Cloud Security Alliance, today we can demonstrate alignment to their Cloud Controls Matrix, a globally recognized standard for the industry."" Leading with security and compliance as the stringent regulatory landscape evolves With regulations continuing to evolve, financial services organizations must prioritize security and compliance to keep up with the demands of new requirements. However, maintaining security and compliance requirements should not come at the price of innovation. The IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center aims to help financial services reduce the amount of time and money spent on maintaining compliance by enabling them to monitor and demonstrate their compliance efforts in the cloud and allowing them to free up resources to drive innovation. The offering includes capabilities to monitor security posture with built-in controls and profiles to help clients adhere to industry requirements such as CSA's CCM and enables clients to proactively monitor their compliance posture. IBM Cloud for Financial Services also includes IBM's innovative confidential computing capabilities and encryption technology to help ensure clients data remains their data only - even IBM cannot access it. IBM will continue to collaborate with organizations, such as the CSA, to help clients drive innovation while monitoring their regulatory and security posture.Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives only.ContactKate Gazzillokate.gazzillo@ibm.com CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-helps-financial-services-industry-manage-risk-and-regulations-with-csa-301703887.htmlSOURCE IBM]"

The safety agency's preliminary evaluation covers 242 Cruise autonomous vehicles and is the first step before it could seek a recall.The investigation follows reports of three crashes in which Cruise vehicles were struck from behind by other vehicles after the autonomous vehicles braked quickly.Cruise is offering limited service in San Francisco with a small fleet of Chevrolet Bolt EVs. Cruise on Thursday announced it had secured the first of the two California permits it needs to charge riders night and day across all of San Francisco, where it currently sells trips in a small part of the city.Cruise said it has ""driven nearly 700,000 fully autonomous miles in an extremely complex urban environment with zero life-threatening injuries or fatalities. ... There’s always a balance between healthy regulatory scrutiny and the innovation we desperately need to save lives, which is why we’ll continue to fully cooperate with NHTSA or any regulator in achieving that shared goal.""NHTSA said it plans to fully assess the potential safety-related issues posed by these two types of incidents and will review ""the commonality and safety logic of the hard braking incidents"" and the ""frequency, duration and safety consequences associated with the vehicle immobilization incidents.""Story continuesGM shares were down 3.5% Friday at $36.31 in midday trading.San Francisco officials did not immediately comment Friday on the NHTSA investigation, which could be a setback to the company's deployment plans.Last month, Cruise Chief Operating Officer Gil West told Reuters the company plans to enter a ""large number of markets"" and scale operations up to ""thousands of vehicles"" in 2023.NHTSA said the issues ""may introduce multiple potential hazards such as a collision with a Cruise vehicle, risk to a stranded passenger exiting an immobilized Cruise vehicle, or obstruction of other traffic including emergency vehicles.""The agency said it has three reports of Cruise vehicles' automated driving system ""initiating a hard braking maneuver in response to another road user that was quickly approaching from the rear. In each case, the other road user subsequently struck the rear of the ADS-equipped vehicle.""Cruise said police did not ticket their vehicles in any of the three crashes.NHTSA said it has been notified of multiple reports involving Cruise vehicles operating without onboard human supervision becoming immobilized, which ""may strand vehicle passengers in unsafe locations, such as lanes of travel or intersections, and become an unexpected obstacle to other road users.""Cruise in September recalled and updated software in 80 self-driving vehicles after a June crash in San Francisco that left two people injured. NHTSA said the recalled software could “incorrectly predict” an oncoming vehicle’s path. Cruise said it had determined this unusual scenario would not recur after the update.GM and Cruise in February disclosed they petitioned the NHTSA for permission to deploy some self-driving vehicles without steering wheels, mirrors, turn signals or windshield wipers. That petition is still pending. (Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Chizu Nomiyama and Jonathan Oatis)]"

Smucker (SJM) Pricing Actions & Coffee Business Solid,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-m-smucker-sjm-pricing-145502757.html,1671116102,STORY,"['SJM', 'MKC-V']","[Strategic pricing efforts and a strong coffee business is favoring The J. M. Smucker Company SJM. The company is benefiting from robust performance in the Away from Home Division. Focus on Core Strategies bodes well amid elevated cost inflation and supply-chain challenges.Let’s delve deeper.Effective Pricing Drives GrowthThe J. M. Smucker has been benefiting from positive net price realization, which was witnessed in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, with higher net price realization contributing 17 percentage points to the top-line growth. During the quarter, net sales growth was mainly backed by positive net price realization in the company segments. In the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment, net price realization had a favorable 16-percentage point impact on net sales. The U.S. Retail Coffee net price realization boosted net sales by 23 percentage points. The net price realization had a nine-percentage point positive impact on sales in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods. In the International and Away From Home unit, net price realization had a positive impact of 18 percentage points on overall net sales.Management’s sales guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects the positive impacts of elevated net pricing to counter cost inflation in many categories. For fiscal 2023, SJM anticipates net sales to rise 5.5-6.5%. Excluding non-comparable sales related to the private label dry pet food and natural beverage and grain businesses’ divestitures, net sales are anticipated to improve by nearly 8% at the midpoint of the net sales guidance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAway from Home Division &amp; Coffee Business SolidThe J. M. Smucker Company is benefiting from strength in the International and Away from Home division. This was witnessed in second-quarter fiscal 2023, with net sales advancing 14% to $297.9 million. Excluding divestitures and currency headwinds, net sales rose 19% for the Away from Home division, driven by double-digit growth for coffee and Uncrustables sandwiches. The segment’s profit climbed 3% to $41.5 million, mainly reflecting a favorable net impact of positive net price realization and higher commodity costs somewhat offset by lower contribution from volume/mix.Talking of the coffee business, the overall coffee portfolio looks encouraging as at-home coffee remains strong, despite inflationary pressures given consumers’ daily coffee habits. In the coffee category, net sales grew 10% led by all brands in the market-leading at-home coffee portfolio during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s Café Bustelo and Folgers brands are doing well in the category.Story continuesGrowth Efforts on TrackThe J. M. Smucker is progressing well with core priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, reshaping portfolio, streamlining cost structure and unleashing its organization to win. Strength in such strategies is helping The J. M. Smucker navigate complex supply chain challenges. These are also helping the company improve in-store fundamentals and stock performance for the brands. The company is implementing inflation-justified pricing actions across all businesses. The company is committed to increasing its focus and resources to reshape its portfolio to achieve sustainable growth across pet food and pet snacks, coffee and snacking categories. To streamline costs, management has been optimizing its supply chain, lowering discretionary costs and expanding network production efficiencies.Hurdles on WayDuring second-quarter fiscal 2023, The J. M. Smucker’s gross profit dipped 1%. The lower gross profit was a result of higher commodity and ingredient, packaging, transportation and manufacturing costs, among other factors partly compensated by improved net price realization. The adjusted operating income fell 2% due to the reduced gross profit and higher selling, distribution and administrative (SD&amp;A) costs.On its quarterly earnings release, management stated that the ongoing cost inflation, a volatile supply chain and a broader macroeconomic landscape continue to affect the company’s results and cause risks for fiscal 2023. That being said, The J.M. Smucker remains focused on actions like minimizing the impacts of cost inflation, product recall and other business hurdles.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 24.9% in the past six months compared to the industry’s growth of 14.8%.3 Solid Staple PicksSome top-ranked stocks are The Chef's Warehouse CHEF, Conagra Brands CAG and McCormick &amp; Company MKC.The Chef's Warehouse, which distributes specialty food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

LW is focused on boosting shareholders’ returns. The provider of value-added frozen potato products announced a dividend hike. It will now pay a dividend of 28 cents per share, suggesting a 14% annualized increase to the quarterly dividend. The hiked dividend will be paid out on Mar 3, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Feb 3, 2023.Lamb Weston currently has a dividend payout of 37%, a dividend yield of 1.1% and a free cash flow yield of 0.8%. With an annual free cash flow return on investment of 3.2%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable.During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management paid out dividends worth $35.3 million and bought back shares worth $28.4 million, returning $63.7 million to its shareholders. Dividend payouts and share buybacks are investors’ biggest enticements and LW is committed to spurring shareholders’ value.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else Should You Know?Lamb Weston’s sturdy balance sheet and capacity to generate cash keep it well-placed to boost production capacity and fuel long-term growth. For 13 weeks ended Aug 28, 2022, capital expenditures (including IT expenditures) amounted to $121.2 million, as it continues to develop new French fry lines in Idaho and China.In September 2022, Lamb Weston unveiled expansion plans for french fry processing capacity in Argentina with the construction of a new manufacturing unit in Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires. In July 2021, the company announced the expansion plan for french fry processing capacity at its existing American Falls, ID facility — with an envisioned capacity to manufacture more than 350 million pounds of frozen french fries and other potato products annually. In March 2021, the company unveiled plans to build a new french fry processing facility in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, China. Lamb Weston’s efforts to boost offerings and expand capacity enable the company to meet rising demand conditions for snacks and fries.Apart from the abovementioned capacity-expansion endeavors, the company (in October 2022) signed an agreement to buy the remaining equity interests in its European joint venture with Meijer Frozen Foods B.V. The acquisition is in sync with LW’s capital allocation and acquisition framework. The move will solidify Lamb Weston’s manufacturing footprint to better serve its customers and tap into growth opportunities across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The company (in Jul 2022) bought an additional 40% stake in Lamb Weston Alimentos Modernos S.A. (""LWAMSA"") — which is its joint venture in Argentina — taking its total ownership to 90%.All said, the hike in dividend is in synch with the company’s prudent capital allocation strategy. This and capacity expansions and acquisitions are likely to keep enhancing LW’s long-term growth and drive its capital allocation decisions.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 33.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 13.2% growth.Story continues3 Solid Staple PicksSome top-ranked stocks are The Chef's Warehouse CHEF, Conagra Brands CAG and McCormick &amp; Company MKC.The Chef's Warehouse, which distributes specialty food products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

On the other hand, JetBlue Airways’ JBLU management expects unit revenues for the December quarter to be at the low end of the previously guided range.United Airlines UAL was also in the news due to its fleet-modernization efforts, with management announcing that UAL will buy at least 100 787 Dreamliners from Boeing. With air-travel demand improving, Copa Holdings CPA reported upbeat traffic numbers for the month of November.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 Driven by upbeat air-travel demand, Delta expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating margin to be 11%, i.e. at the top of the previously guided 9-11% range. DAL now expects adjusted earnings per share in the $1.35-$1.40 range (the earlier outlook was in the range of $1-$1.25). Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 7-8% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the earlier outlook was for an increase in the 5-9% range). For full-year 2022, adjusted earnings are expected in the $3.07-$3.12 range. Meanwhile, full-year 2022 total revenues are expected in the $45.5-$45.6 billion range.

Alaska Air now expects fourth-quarter 2022 capacity to decline in the 7-9% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (earlier guidance called for a 7-10% decline). On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, ALK now expects fourth-quarter 2022 total revenues to increase 13-14% from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the previous guidance had hinted at a 12-15% increase). Moreover, ALK’s management aims to resume share buybacks early next year , following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act. Story continues3. In a bid to modernize its fleet, United Airlines placed the largest 787 Dreamliner order to Boeing. UAL will purchase 100 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with options to buy 100 more. UAL anticipates getting delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032. The new jets are expected to result in 25% improvement pertaining to fuel usage compared with the older Boeing 767 widebodies and some 777s that will be placed. As a result of this massive deal, significant job opportunities for pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians, among others are also likely to be created.4. With hurricane Nicole impacting operations, close-in demand for the final month of the year has been weaker than expected, per JetBlue’s management. Apart from the hurricane, the holiday calendar timing this year had a greater-than-expected negative impact. As a result, JBLU now anticipates revenue per available seat mile for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be at the low end of its earlier guided range of a 15-19% increase from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals.JBLU was also in the news recently due to its environmentally-friendly approach. That story was reported in detail in the previous week’s write-up.5. In November 2022, Copa Holdings’ traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles (RPMs), increased 6.4% to 1.81 billion from the comparable period’s level in 2019. Increased passenger volume led to this upside. To match upbeat demand, CPA is increasing capacity — measured in available seat miles (ASMs) — which increased 4.6% from the November 2019 level to 2.08 billion. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) improved 150 basis points to 87% in November 2022.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week.

(NYSE:PNC) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$183 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$150. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In total, PNC Financial Services Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).PNC Financial Services Group Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at PNC Financial Services Group. Specifically, Executive VP Deborah Guild ditched US$452k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$206m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PNC Financial Services Group Insiders?An insider sold PNC Financial Services Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, PNC Financial Services Group makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PNC Financial Services Group.

Pinnacle West has gained 12.6% since the start of the year compared to the -0.7% move for the Zacks Utilities sector and the 0.5% return for the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on November 3, 2022, Pinnacle West reported EPS of $2.88 versus consensus estimate of $2.62.For the current fiscal year, Pinnacle West is expected to post earnings of $4.09 per share on $4.02 billion in revenues. This represents a -25.23% change in EPS on a 5.74% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.22 per share on $4.24 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 3.18% and 5.4%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPinnacle West may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Pinnacle West has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 18.7X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 6.5X versus its peer group's average of 8.5X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Pinnacle West currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Pinnacle West meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Pinnacle West shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

235,33b7d444-482a-31fb-af00-576313a31769,TGT,2022-12-16,Target's (NYSE:TGT) earnings growth rate lags the 21% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/targets-nyse-tgt-earnings-growth-120056153.html,1671192056,STORY,['TGT'],"[Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 10% in the last quarter. But in stark contrast, the returns over the last half decade have impressed. We think most investors would be happy with the 126% return, over that period. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Only time will tell if there is still too much optimism currently reflected in the share price. Unfortunately not all shareholders will have held it for the long term, so spare a thought for those caught in the 34% decline over the last twelve months.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Target To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Target achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 9.4% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 18% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Target's TSR for the last 5 years was 154%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Target shareholders did even worse, losing 33% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 21% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.But note: Target may not be the best stock to buy.

Hence SBAC’s site-leasing revenue growth is likely to remain robust in the upcoming period.SBA Communications’ portfolio expansion efforts into select international markets with high growth characteristics positions it well to take advantage of the secular trends in mobile data usage and wireless spending growth across the globe. In the third quarter, it acquired 131 communication sites for total cash consideration of $54.9 million and built 113 towers.This October, the company closed the earlier announced acquisition of 2,632 sites from Grupo TorreSur in Brazil for $725 million in cash. The recent 5G spectrum options in Brazil positions SBA Communications well to benefit from the transaction.On the balance-sheet front, SBA Communications exited third-quarter 2022 with $297.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash and short-term investments. As of Oct 31, 2022, the company had $995 million outstanding under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. With ample financial flexibility, SBAC is well-poised to capitalize on future growth opportunities.Further, SBAC’s current cash flow growth is projected at 24.96% compared with 9.70% estimated for the industry.SBA Communications’ share buybacks and time-to-time dividend hikes demonstrate its commitment to driving shareholder value alongside boosting shareholders’ confidence in the stock.However, the company has a high customer concentration, with Verizon VZ, AT&amp;T T and T-Mobile TMUS accounting for the majority of its domestic site-leasing revenues. Notably, in the third quarter of 2022, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon accounted for 40.9%, 28.8% and 20.1%, respectively, of SBAC’s domestic site-leasing revenues.Therefore, the loss of any of these customers, consolidation among them or a reduction in network spending might hurt the company’s top line significantly.SBA Communications has a substantially leveraged balance sheet with a high debt-to-capital ratio compared with the industry average. This limits its strength to withstand any credit crisis and unexpected negative externalities in the future.Also, a hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained only 3.5% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s growth of 8.0%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNote: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Use Regions' Daily Spending Tracker for the next several weeks for a clear picture of spending habits, and see where spending can be reduced.Make budget adjustments: After analyzing spending, use Regions' Personal Spending Plan Worksheet and focus on ""needs"" versus ""wants."" Start with the biggest areas of spending, such as entertainment and transportation, and see where it's possible to cut back. For example, consider cancelling or rotating between subscriptions for monthly streaming services. Ask a friend or coworker to carpool to activities or work to decrease spending on gas. Shop around for lower rates on car, home or renters insurance.Pay down variable-rate debt: Periods of inflation are particularly good times to focus on minimizing existing debt with variable interest rates, such as credit card debt. Include these payments as a line item in the monthly budget. If there are cost savings, reallocate that money to paying down other debt or add it to savings.Look for unexpected ways to increase savings: Try making small changes that can add up over time. One way is to unsubscribe from marketing emails to eliminate the temptation of deals and sales. When online shopping, wait a day before purchasing the items to be sure they are still wanted or needed. Consider setting a ""no spend"" day or week to avoid excess spending. This can be for a specific category, such as groceries, clothing or entertainment. Get more savings tips in these savings podcasts.Dial back on energy bills: The costs of basic utilities like electricity, water and heating fuel can add up quickly during the hotter and colder months, but with some easy changes to your routine you can begin to save. The S. Department of Energy's tips for saving money and energy in your home include: unplugging electronics when not in use, which can save 10% on a monthly electric bill, and use warm water instead of hot when doing laundry to cut the amount of energy used for the load in half.Trim grocery costs: Food expenses can add up quickly, so look for smart and creative ways to save. Put aside brand preferences and focus on the lowest prices. Watch for coupons and check weekly store ads. Cut back spending on meat by having ‘Meatless Mondays' at home. Consider introducing monthly freezer, fridge or pantry cleanouts to use what is already on hand before buying more.For more, visit www.Regions.com/NextStepFamilyBudget, or visit any Regions branch to speak with an associate.About Regions Financial CorporationRegions Financial Corporation (NYSE:RF), with $158 billion in assets, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index and is one of the nation's largest full-service providers of consumer and commercial banking, wealth management, and mortgage products and services.

(NYSE:V)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-visa-inc-110042919.html,1671188442,STORY,['V'],"[Let's talk about the popular Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Visa’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Visa What Is Visa Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 6.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Visa today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $221.94, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Visa’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Visa look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 41% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Visa. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? V’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on V, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

V announced at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit that the company plans to invest $1 billion in Africa. It intends to inject the amount over the next five years to capitalize on the continent’s rapid growth in the digital payment market.During a sub-event at the summit, U.S.-Africa Business Forum, Visa CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr. pledged the amount, which is expected to boost the company’s footprint in the continent. It plans to work with governments, fintechs, financial institutions, merchants and even mobile network operators to scale its operations.Talent development and capacity building will likely help Visa in strengthening the payment ecosystem in Africa, which will support its digitization efforts. This is expected to play a major role in the company’s long-term growth plan. V has been investing in the continent for several decades now.The company said that 500 million people in the region have no access to formal financial services. Also, lower than 50% of adults have utilized digital payments ever. More than 40 million merchants in the continent are yet to accept digital payments. Hence, Visa has a major untouched region to expand its network.Currently, the company has 10 offices across the continent. With new investments, the number is expected to rise.

This was followed by the European Central Bank also signaling that it will continue raising rates, with headline inflation continuing to trend above the bank’s target range.A batch of weak U.S. and euro zone economic data also showed that both economies are struggling under the yoke of high inflation and rising interest rates.Spot gold was flat around $1,776.15 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,787.05 an ounce by 19:07 ET (00:07 GMT). Both instruments slumped nearly 2% on Thursday.The yellow metal was also set to lose around 1.1% this week, rattled by a recovery in the dollar as investors sought safe haven in the greenback.Gold has largely lost its status as a safe haven this year, as rising U.S. interest rates pushed up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. This saw the dollar largely overtake gold as the market’s favored safe haven, despite growing fears of a U.S. recession.Other precious metals were also subject to steep selling this week, given that the Fed’s comments blindsided investors hoping for a shift in the central bank’s hawkish rhetoric. Platinum futures were set to lose 2% this week, while silver futures were down 1.9%.Even so, a majority of investors are still pricing in a smaller, 25 basis point hike by the Fed in February.Among industrial metals, copper suffered deeper losses this week as rising COVID-19 infections in major importer China added another degree of uncertainty to markets already reeling from worsening growth prospects.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $3.7843 a pound, recovering slightly from a 2.5% tumble on Thursday. But the red metal was set to lose about 2.4% this week.While China’s relaxing of nationwide anti-COVID measures initially drove bids into copper, the resulting spike in infections swiftly culled any hopes for a quick reopening in the world’s largest copper importer.Still, the red metal is expected to benefit from an eventual reopening in the country next year.Related ArticlesGold fails to catch a bid above $1,800 as recession fears growOil rises, poised to end week higher despite economy concernsCalifornia regulators approve changes to rooftop solar policy]"

This, along with gains from its Value Creation plan, bodes well. This led to impressive third-quarter 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, marking the ninth straight earnings beat and the 10th consecutive sales surprise.Adjusted earnings of $4.14 per share improved 16% from earnings of $3.57 reported in the prior-year quarter. Net sales grew 6.2% to $1,102.5 million, driven by organic sales growth of 10.4%. Management remains on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives.In the third quarter, Snap-on’s adjusted gross profit grew 2.3% year over year. The upside was backed by higher sales volume and gains from the RCI initiatives, which more than offset higher material and other costs.The company’s operating earnings before financial services totaled $223.5 million, up 11% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings before financial services expanded 90 bps to 20.3% in the third quarter. Consolidated operating earnings (including financial services) were $289.9 million, up 6.6% year over year. As a percentage of sales, operating earnings expanded 20 bps to 24.4%.The company remains on track with its Rapid Continuous Improvement process and other cost-reduction initiatives. The RCI process is designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs, beside helping Snap-on to boost sales and margins, and generate savings.Savings from the RCI initiative reflect gains from the continuous productivity and process improvement plans. Management intends to boost customer services along with enhancing manufacturing and supply-chain capabilities through the RCI initiatives and further investments.Snap-on’s ability to innovate bodes well. The company has been investing in new products and increasing brand awareness across the world.Its robust business model helps to enhance value-creation processes, which, in turn, improves safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation. The company’s growth strategy focuses on three critical areas, namely enhancing the franchise network, improving relationships with repair shop owners and managers, and expanding critical industries in emerging markets.Higher sales volume and gains from the RCI initiatives boosted margins in the third quarter.

Rising cost inflation, stemming from higher raw material expenses, and increased transportation costs, is likely to remain a deterrent.Also, unfavorable currency remains concerning. In third-quarter 2022, the company’s sales were affected by an unfavorable foreign currency of $39.1 million. Sales in the Commercial &amp; Industrial Group, Tools Group, and Repair Systems &amp; Information Group segments included $20.8 million, $8.9 million and $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, respectively.Wrapping UpAll said, Snap-on’s cost-cutting efforts, RCI plan and solid business momentum are likely to help sustain its momentum and offset the aforementioned headwinds. An uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes a positive sentiment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Snap-on’s 2022 sales and EPS suggests growth of 5.6% and 10.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Earnings estimates for the current financial year have increased 2.2% to $16.49 over the past 60 days.

With responses from more than 2,300 fleet managers, executives and other mobile business professionals across 14 countries, the data emphasizes that technology adoption is helping fleets navigate operational obstacles to drive results and build resilience.“In today’s hyper-connected and complex world, fleet technology is being leveraged as a stabilizing force amid the many intensifying business challenges,” said Peter Mitchell, senior vice president and general manager, Verizon Connect. “At Verizon, our goal is to be a true partner to our customers and help them uncover hidden costs while promoting safety. We help them streamline business operations so they can stay focused on driving greater productivity and efficiency to improve their business and overall customer experience.”State of the Industry 4.0 — Strength in TechnologyWith strained budgets and resources, many fleets may find it difficult to maintain operations as they are, let alone improve them. Increasing costs (73%), such as higher prices for fuel, cost of living and inflation, were reported as the big challenge worldwide in this year’s report. In the US, this was followed by labor shortages (59%) and meeting customer demand (52%)—all of which grew steadily year over year.In EMEA and APAC, respondents believe customer service will have the biggest impact in the near future to help improve customer retention and satisfaction. Already, fleet tracking solutions have helped 70% of survey respondents improve their customer service in EMEA, while 55% of survey respondents in Australia and New Zealand reported improved customer service since they implemented a fleet tracking solution.Story continuesBoosting Customer Service, Productivity and MaintenanceWhile current challenges won’t be resolved overnight, focusing on the factors within a fleet’s control can help calm the chaos. Fleet management technology is already being seen as a powerful tool that equips fleets with the data they need to make better decisions, navigate challenges and help improve fleet performance. In fact, 85% of respondents globally who are currently using fleet tracking software reported finding it to be helpful.Effective route planning is critical in making efficient use of fuel, as well as reducing overall operating costs. In 2022, nearly half of businesses were able to reduce their fuel consumption (46%) and accidents (46%) through the use of GPS fleet tracking solutions, reporting an average 11% decrease in fuel costs and 15% reduction in accident costs. Global labor costs were also reduced by 20%, with Australia and New Zealand realizing the biggest impact at 28% savings.Asset tracking is also being recognized for its ability to empower safety, equipment utilization and team productivity, with 65% of respondents currently using asset tracking considering the tool beneficial. In the US, adoption of asset tracking rose by 6% (up to 29% this year)—seeing the highest percentage increase of new users over other technologies.Seemingly, building a resilient business is more important now than ever before. Fleet tracking technology goes beyond just dots on a map. It gives fleet managers much-needed visibility into driver behaviors, fleet costs and vehicle wear and tear. The Verizon Connect platform gives users the visibility they need to get more done. With dashboards and customizable reports, managers can check the pulse of their business at any point in time.To see the full report findings, visit the 2023 Fleet Technology Trends Report page.

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for McKesson is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for McKesson imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for McKessonThis prescription drug distributor is expected to earn $24.75 per share for the fiscal year ending March 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 4.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for McKesson. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.3%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of McKesson to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TRV have gained 15.2% in a year, outperforming the industry's increase of 4.7%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite decreased 15.6% in the said time frame. With a market capitalization of $43.7 billion, the average volume of shares traded in the last three months was 1.4 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rally was largely driven by strong net earned premiums, high levels of retention, improved pricing and sufficient liquidity.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) insurer has a solid track record of beating earnings estimates in each of the last seven quarters.Travelers has a favorable VGM Score of A. VGM Score helps to identify stocks with the most attractive value, best growth and the most promising momentum.Will the Bull Run Continue?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share is pegged at $14.68, indicating year-over-year increases of 11.4%.Travelers’s return on equity for the trailing 12 months is 14.3%, up 220 basis points year over year, reflecting efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ fund.  Riding on strong net earned premiums and an aggregate underlying combined ratio for Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, strong underwriting results continued in the commercial businesses. High levels of retention, improved pricing, an increase in new business and a positive renewal premium change should continue to drive Travelers.TRV expects domestic automobile renewal premium change to be in double digits in the fourth quarter and be in the mid-teens throughout 2023.Travelers raised the outlook for fixed income net investment income (NII), including earnings from short-term securities to be around $500 million after tax in the fourth quarter of 2022. TRV also projected nearly $540 million on average per quarter in 2023, with an estimated $515 million in the first quarter. Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio, and strong returns from the non-fixed-income portfolio are likely to  drive the metric higher.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Travelers’s 2022 and 2023 revenues is pegged at $36.8 billion and $39.9 billion, indicating  year-over-year increases of 6.1% and 8.7%, respectively.The property and casualty insurer maintains a conservative balance sheet among its peers. The debt-to-capital ratio (excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders’ equity) was within the insurer’s target range of 15% to 25%.Travelers has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years.

278,e852a1dc-cc1d-3809-a0be-cedcb3a16b3f,APD,2022-12-16,"With 85% ownership of the shares, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-ownership-shares-air-products-110055286.html,1671188455,STORY,['APD'],"[If you want to know who really controls Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 85% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Air Products and Chemicals, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Air Products and Chemicals?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Air Products and Chemicals already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Air Products and Chemicals' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Air Products and Chemicals is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.6% of common stock, and State Farm Insurance Companies, Asset Management Arm holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Air Products and ChemicalsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$233m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Air Products and Chemicals. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Air Products and Chemicals better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

IOSP.Industry: ChemicalsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2028960/4-diversified-chemical-stocks-to-watch-amid-industry-woesThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is grappling with raw material cost inflation as well as higher supply-chain, energy and logistics costs, made worse by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Semiconductor shortage, which is hurting the automotive sector, and pandemic-related restrictions in China may also impact demand for chemicals. Industry players like Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Albemarle Corporation, Univar Solutions Inc. and Innospec Inc. are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and aggressive price hikes to tide over the challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building &amp; construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture.Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities, and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride), and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide). Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?Higher Input Costs Pose Margin Headwinds: The industry players are exposed to cost pressure associated with raw materials resulting from short supply. These companies also face challenges arising from higher supply-chain and logistics costs. The disruption in the supply chain has pushed up the prices of inputs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and new government-mandated lockdowns in China have also put more pressure on the already strained global supply chain.Story continuesThese companies are also facing headwinds from higher energy costs, especially in Europe, which has witnessed a significant spike in costs amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. The lingering impacts of these bottlenecks are expected to continue over the short term. Higher raw material, energy and logistics costs are, thus, likely to hurt the margins of diversified chemical companies.Demand Worries From Chip Crunch, China Slowdown: Companies in the chemical-diversified space face headwinds from the slowdown in the global automotive industry. The semiconductor shortage has led to reduced automotive builds around the world, causing a slowdown in chemical demand in this major market.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has triggered a fresh round of global microchip shortage. Both these countries are major suppliers of raw materials required for global semiconductor production. The chip crisis is unlikely to abate anytime soon, given the impact of the war.The slowdown in automotive production may create a short-term demand headwind. The slowdown in economic activities in China due to the restrictions following a resurgence in COVID-19 infections is also impacting chemical demand. The restrictions in China have resulted in a higher level of near-term economic uncertainty, which may continue to affect chemical volumes.Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. These include the reduction of discretionary spending and traveling expenses.The industry players are also raising selling prices to counter raw material and logistics cost inflation. These moves are likely to help the industry in sustaining margins amid the prevailing challenges.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Genuine Parts The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.21bUS$1.36bUS$1.14bUS$1.21bUS$1.20bUS$1.21bUS$1.21bUS$1.23bUS$1.24bUS$1.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -0.66%Est @ 0.13%Est @ 0.69%Est @ 1.08%Est @ 1.35%Est @ 1.54% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.8% US$1.1kUS$1.2kUS$914US$898US$828US$769US$718US$674US$634US$597(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.3bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.8%– 2.0%) = US$22bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$22b÷ ( 1 + 7.8%)10= US$10bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$19b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$179, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Genuine Parts as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.042. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Genuine PartsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Retail Distributors market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

James Cameron's follow-up to the highest grossing film ever expecting a monster $175 million opening weekend.- Do it.- Just breathe. Breathe.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm trying. I'm so excited. ""The Way of Water"" currently has an 82% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. Let's discuss it with Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore senior media analyst, and our own Allie Canal. Paul, great to see you. This movie looks outstanding. I cannot pretend that I'm not biased and excited to see it. Have you seen it? What do you make of the early reviews and estimates?PAUL DERGARABEDIAN: Well, I am seeing it in about an hour from now, so check back with me about four hours after that because it's a three hour and 12 minute movie. The buzz on this movie is off the charts. I've talked to people. It's like they've been inhabited by something. When they come out of the movie, they're like on the sugar high. And a long movie like that, you would think, oh, people come out exhausted. It seems like people just want to go back and see it again. That's great news.And as you said in the teaser here, this will give James Cameron his first $100 million domestic opening. Believe it or not, that's a great trivia question. His highest grossing opener domestically was the first ""Avatar,"" was 77 million. So he's going to obliterate that opening record for himself this weekend for sure, Dave. For sure.ALLIE CANAL: And Paul, I want to jump in here and pick up on that point. Only 77 million in the opening weekend and then the film went on to become the highest grossing film of all time.PAUL DERGARABEDIAN: That's right.ALLIE CANAL: So talk to me about how-- could this be a more slower burn? Obviously, the appetite is there, but will it be different than some of the Marvel Avenger films that we've seen?Story continuesPAUL DERGARABEDIAN: Well, Allie, you make a great point because when you look at Cameron's career, he's a marathoner. He's not a sprinter, both in terms of his output of films, but also in terms of box office. For example, ""Titanic,"" which we all know and love, opened in mid-December, like ""Avatar,"" the first one, and this ""Avatar,"" to a mere $28.6 million. It wound up with over 600 million domestically. That's a 21 times multiple meaning of that opening weekend. It went on to earn 21 times that in North America, but over 1.8 million worldwide. ""Avatar"" ranks as the highest grossing film of all time worldwide with close to 2.9 billion.But you're absolutely right. It may be a slower burn. It's a long movie, although I don't think that's going to hurt its potential this weekend, because what theaters are doing is, they can open up every screen or every auditorium to ""The Way of Water"" because the demand will certainly be there, and we're already seeing that in the numbers. So I'm really excited to see it. I know a lot of people are. And the movie industry needs this movie right now. We've had a slow post summer period. ""Wakanda Forever"" was number one for five weekends in a row. And now we're looking for ""Avatar, The Way of Water"" to take over that mantle.ALLIE CANAL: And the buzz and the reviews will likely help with that opening weekend performance. And talk to me a little bit about the China aspect of this all. China has been very notorious with rejecting films. ""The Way of Water"" did get that green light. But is there a potential risk, especially with China's zero-COVID policy?PAUL DERGARABEDIAN: Well, I think that those exterior forces could come into play. But I think most importantly for the movie is that by getting a movie like ""Avatar"" into China-- and remember, China for the first film was the second biggest market for the original ""Avatar"" film. So this is very important. And IMAX and 3D large format play a huge part in this. And in China, that's the second biggest movie market in the world. So it's a big benefit for ""Avatar, The Way of Water"" to have China in the mix, no question. When they announced that, that was big news for the film.And with Cameron looking for one of the top grossing films of all time to add to his already illustrious box office career and to greenlight the next three installments, you're going to have to make a lot of money on this one. This is not an inexpensive film. And this is a long-term commitment. This is a legacy project for Cameron. So the stakes couldn't be higher.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, it essentially, has to be the highest grossing film ever just to make any money. The next blockbuster--PAUL DERGARABEDIAN: It has to be in that mix, for sure.DAVE BRIGGS: The next blockbuster could actually be college football. Cinemark is pairing up with ESPN to show the college football playoff. How does this work? Could it open the door to more sports in movie theaters?PAUL DERGARABEDIAN: Oh, Dave, this is absolutely incredible. Movie theaters need content. They need movies, but they also love, especially midweek and even on the weekends, to have great, what we call alternative content for their screens. We've seen this with Fathom events, Trafalgar, Iconic. We've seen a lot of events like this. Met opera, if you want to see an opera, you can go to your movie theater. You want to see Coldplay or BTS, you can see those groups in a theater, the musical groups. And so that's really a great thing.Video gaming is big. There was a ""League of Legends"" event that people were able to go to the movie theater to watch or and/or play video games. And that's huge for theaters. Sports is a new frontier, I think both for the streaming side of things and also for movie theaters. Live sports, it could be huge. The potential there is quite amazing.ALLIE CANAL: And Paul, with that, when we close out 2020, head into 2023, what sort of lessons have we learned? And with those opportunities, sports, maybe even more streaming exclusives in the box office, where do you think we go from there?PAUL DERGARABEDIAN: Well, I think the lesson learned is that you need a lot of movies and you need them coming out evenly on the release calendar. So for instance, in our comscore data, we've shown this year to date we have 38 fewer wide release films than we had in 2019. That's a lot of movies. That's potentially a billion and a half dollars' worth of domestic box office.So next year, it looks a lot more evenly spaced with ""Ant-Man"" coming out in February, ""John Wick"" after that. You've got ""Mission Impossible 7."" You've got some really big movies. ""Indiana Jones 5""-- I could go on and on. So many big movies, but the lesson learned is, if you build it, they will come. I know it's a cliché, but when the movies were out there in the summer, we saw the box office explode. But there weren't as many films in the post-summer period, and thus we saw the box office drop and perhaps people migrating home to watch content on TV.But if it's out there in the theaters, and it's appealing like ""Avatar,"" like ""Puss in Boots"" yet to come, the Whitney Houston movie-- there's some really good movies on the horizon-- and ""Babylon,"" of course, I think those movies will draw people to the theater now and into 2023 and beyond.DAVE BRIGGS: Excellent. Can't wait for your review. Paul Dergarabedian, Allie Canal, thank you so much.]"

Since its inception, the program has provided employment to approximately 300 Chicago-area residents.""In recent years, a succession of financial challenges has created hardships for an increasing number of customers – many of whom have never before needed financial assistance,"" said Nichole Owens, ComEd vice president of customer channels. ""To meet the needs of these customers, we continue to innovate to connect as many families and individuals as possible with the assistance they need. The creation of CEAA is just one example of how we partner with local communities to meet customers where they are.""CEAAs are trained to play a crucial role in informing community members about the options available to help them address past-due balances on their energy bills, and access ways to better manage their energy use. This includes promoting residential customer awareness and enrollment in governmental financial-assistance options such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), as well as ComEd’s bill-assistance and energy-efficiency options.Story continuesTo implement the CEAA program, ComEd works with the Chatham Business Association (CBA), who initially helped identify community institutions across INVEST South/West neighborhoods that hire, train, equip and manage CEAAs.

Participants subscribe to a solar energy project and earn credits on their monthly utility bills for their portion of the energy produced by the solar project.Energy-efficiency offerings, including services and incentives designed for income-eligible residential customers, that can help reduce energy use now and in the future.To make it easier for all customers to find bill-assistance and energy-savings options, ComEd encourages customers to use its Smart Assistance Manager (SAM), an online self-service tool that matches customers with programs that can help them manage their electric bills now and into the future.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Colgate-Palmolive could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Colgate-Palmolive.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Colgate-Palmolive's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 27%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 15% in total over the last three years. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 17% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Colgate-Palmolive is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesWe've established that Colgate-Palmolive maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.It is also worth noting that we have found 1 warning sign for Colgate-Palmolive that you need to take into consideration.You might be able to find a better investment than Colgate-Palmolive.

300,57e08149-2252-3935-9e38-8168f95fceba,CMCSA,2022-12-16,Is It Too Late To Consider Buying Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-comcast-corporation-120025555.html,1671192025,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Let's talk about the popular Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Comcast’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Comcast What Is Comcast Worth?Comcast appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Comcast’s ratio of 27.69x is above its peer average of 12.27x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Media industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Comcast’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Comcast generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Comcast. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in CMCSA’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe CMCSA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CMCSA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for CMCSA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Comcast, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing. While conducting our analysis, we found that Comcast has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.If you are no longer interested in Comcast, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

301,4498bee1-ba72-3bb3-b43d-365d175ff5e2,CMCSA,2022-12-16,Time to Buy Comcast and Dish Network Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-buy-comcast-dish-network-000512771.html,1671149112,STORY,"['DISH', 'CMCSA']","[The Zacks Cable Television Industry is down -36% year to date but many of these stocks may be on the cusp of oversold territory. Comcast CMCSA and Dish Network DISH, two of the more notable names in the space, may be drawing investors’ interest as their stocks have bounced off of their October lows.Let’s see if it’s time to buy Comcast (CMCSA) and Dish Network (DISH), for December and beyond.Recent &amp; Historical Performance After simultaneously hitting their 52-week lows on October 13, both stocks have started to rebound, with CMCSA up +15% and DISH +12% to outperform broader indexes since Mid-October.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchComcast is down -31% year to date to outperform DISH’s -53%, with both lagging the S&amp;P 500’s -17%. Over the last decade, Comcast’s total return is +86% to crush DISH but still lag the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFrom a decade’s view, Comcast and Dish Network stock might look oversold. Checking their outlook and the value they offer investors at current levels will give a better indication of if now is the time to buy.Valuation Trading at $34 per share and roughly 33% from its highs, Comcast has a forward P/E of 9.8X. In comparison, DISH is 59% off its high at around $15 a share and trades at 6X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBoth stocks look very attractive relative to their past. Comcast trades well below its decade-high P/E of 21.1X and at a 43% discount from its median of 17.4X. When comparing this period, DISH trades even further from its decade high of 50.1X and 65% beneath its decade median of 17.1X.EV/EBITDA is also a good valuation metric to consider when looking at the valuation of cable companies. In this regard, both companies also appear to offer nice value at their current levels. Comcast sticks out at just 6.2X its enterprise value but DISH is further below its decade high of 24.6X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesGrowth &amp; OutlookPivoting to growth, both companies are making a conscious effort to expand into wireless services as linear TV begins to slowly fade and digital streaming continues to grow more popular and, in many cases, replace standard TV.Companies like Netflix NFLX are challenging the core revenue of Comcast and Dish network.The ability to diversify into wireless services appears to be important in sustaining top and bottom lines as Netflix has also launched a cheaper subscription service featuring ads.Comcast’s wireless revenue accounted for roughly 4% of its total revenue in 2021 at $2.38 billion. In addition to this, Comcast was able to turn its first profit from its wireless segment at $157 million. Last quarter, the company added a record 333,000 new wireless users. Wireless revenue also increased 30.8% during Q3 to $789 million.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchComcast’s earnings are now expected to jump 12% to $3.61 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 EPS is projected to rise another 3%. However, earnings estimate revisions have slightly declined for both FY22 and FY23 over the last 90 days. Sales are projected to be up 4% this year and be virtually flat in FY23 at $120.78 billion. FY23 sales would still represent 11% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $108.94 billion.Turning to Dish, the company more recently entered the retail wireless business after it acquired Boost Mobile and Ting Mobile in 2020.Dish has also worked to expand its network services partnership with TMobile TMUS. During the third quarter, T-Mobile transferred 139,000 wireless subscribers to Dish Network which included Boost-branded customers from Sprint. Dish added 1,000 net wireless subscribers compared to a net decrease of 121,000 in Q3 2021. However, Dish still ended the third quarter with 8.01 million retail wireless subscribers, down -8% year over year.Dish Network earnings are forecasted to decline -31% this year to $2.59 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to drop another -50% to $1.29 a share. Still, earnings estimates for FY22 have gone up slightly while FY23 estimates have trended down over the last quarter.  On its top line, Dish Network sales are now projected to drop -6% this year and decline -1% in FY23 to $16.61 billion. FY23 sales would still be a 29% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDividendsDividends come in handy in the current market environment, and Comcast has the advantage here. CMCSA offers a solid 3.06% annual dividend yield at $1.08 per share. On the other hand, Dish does not offer a dividend at the moment.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineComcast (CMCSA) and Dish Network (DISH) stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). These stocks are starting to look attractive from a valuation perspective with Dish standing out in this regard. However, Comcast’s performance and growth appear to have the edge and CMSA has a generous dividend to support patient investors.Holding both stocks at current levels could end up being rewarding in 2023. To that point, Comcast and Dish Networks’ fourth quarter earnings and guidance will play a big part in their stocks continuing to climb off of their October lows.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PFI) (Newark, NJ) [NYSE: PRU], referred to as Prudential. Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of ""a-"" (Excellent) of PFI and all Long- and Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR; Short-Term IR) of the group. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (Please see link below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.)The ratings reflect Prudential’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, very favorable business profile and very strong enterprise risk management.Prudential’s very favorable business profile is rooted in its vast and diversified product offerings for life, annuities and asset management services. The pension risk transfer business has also changed its risk profile over the past decade and the large deals and successful practice has positioned Prudential to be among the top market participants. The most recent transaction, in partnership with one of its largest competitors in this space, illustrates the value Prudential has in pension risk management and as an administrator. Additionally, Prudential has invested in technology to support new and expanding sales and administration capabilities to support its already large and expansive captive field sales forces. This has been especially important to maintain competitiveness in the market during the COVID-19 pandemic, when face-to-face selling has been challenging in the U.S. and Japan markets.AM Best has a favorable view of Prudential’s long-term operating profile, but notes that near-term assumption updates and higher COVID-19-related claims due to interim regulatory requirements in Japan have pressured earnings for the year. From a balance sheet perspective, this does place pressure on the quality of capital given the earnings trend has been somewhat volatile outside of the domestic life and health market. Claims trends in Japan are primarily driven by lingering effects of COVID-19 and policy effects. However, these offsets may be temporary. In addition, Prudential’s balance sheet strength is foundationally driven by its investment portfolio and strategic allocations to higher performing, high quality assets with lower exposure to low quality structured securities. AM Best has observed adequate liquidity metrics and favorable financial flexibility options through its access to the capital markets and avenues such as the Federal Home Loan Bank membership.Story continuesA complete listing of Prudential Financial, Inc.’s FSRs, Long-Term ICRs and Long- and Short-Term IRs also is available.This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

Following the results, the company’s shares declined 2.2% in after-hour trading session on Dec 14. Disappointing new orders guidance hurt investors’ sentiment.Pertaining to the quarterly release, Stuart Miller, executive chairman of Lennar, said, “As we have seen over the past quarters, interest rates are fluctuating and are likely to continue to move, and the housing market will continue to rebalance pricing and interest rates. While we have a clear-cut strategy of execution, as we look towards 2023, we will only give broad boundaries for deliveries and gross margin. For the first quarter of 2023, the range for deliveries will be between 12,000 to 13,500 homes and gross margin will be about 21%. For the full year 2023, the range for deliveries will be between 60,000 to 65,000 homes.”Quarterly NumbersLEN reported adjusted quarterly earnings (excluding mark-to-market losses) of $5.02 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.92 per share and increased 15% year over year. This marked the 15th consecutive quarter of an earnings beat. The bottom line primarily benefited from effective cost control and focus on making the company’s homebuilding platform more efficient, which resulted in higher operating leverage.Revenues of $10.17 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.24 billion. The reported figure, however, grew 20.6% year over year.Segment DetailsHomebuilding: The revenues of the segment totaled $9.74 billion, up 21.5% from the prior-year quarter. Within the Homebuilding umbrella, home sales contributed $9.65 billion to total revenues, up 21.1% from a year ago. Land sales accounted for $79.2 million, up from $36.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The Other homebuilding unit contributed $8.17 million to homebuilding revenues, down from $8.45 million a year ago.Home deliveries for the reported quarter improved 13% from the year-ago level to 20,064 units. Notably, supply-chain constraints are improving but continue to limit deliveries. The average sales price of homes delivered was $483,000, up 8% from the year-ago figure.New orders declined 15% from the year-ago quarter to 13,200 homes. The potential value of net orders also decreased 24% year over year to $5.5 billion.Backlog at the fiscal fourth-quarter end declined 21% from a year ago to 18,869 homes. Potential housing revenues from backlog decreased 23% year over year to $8.7 billion.Story continuesHomebuilding MarginsThe gross margin on home sales was 24.8% for the quarter, down 320 basis points (bps). The downside can be attributed to an increase in costs per square foot primarily owing to increased material and labor costs, and land costs. However, revenue per quarter foot increased in the quarter.Selling, general and administrative or SG&amp;A expenses — as a percentage of home sales — declined 20 bps to 5.8% on increase in leverage owing to higher volume and average sales price. This marks the lowest percentage for any quarter in Lennar’s history.Homebuilding operating’s earnings of $1.82 billion for the quarter increased from the year-ago level of $1.75 billion.Financial Services: The segment’s revenues increased year over year to $230.7 million from $229 million for the reported quarter. Operating earnings for the quarter also rose to $125.2 million from $111.4 million a year ago.Lennar Multi-Family: Revenues of $179.2 million in the segment were down from $188.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The segment registered operating earnings of $14.9 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $9.3 million a year ago.Lennar Other: The segment’s revenues totaled $22.8 million, up from $0.6 million a year ago. The segment’s operating loss was $105.1 million for the quarter compared with a loss of $176.2 million in the comparable period of 2021.FinancialsAs of Nov 30, Lennar had homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 billion, up from $2.74 billion on Nov 30, 2021. Total homebuilding debt was $4 billion as of Aug 31, down from $4.65 billion at the fiscal 2021-end. Homebuilding debt to capital at the fiscal fourth-quarter end was 14.4%, down from 18.3% at the fiscal 2021-end.LEN has no outstanding borrowings under the $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, thereby providing $7.2 billion of available capacity.Lennar repurchased 11 million shares for $967.4 million in fiscal 2022.GuidanceFor the first-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects deliveries within 12,000-13,500 homes, with a gross margin on home sales of nearly 21%. New orders are likely to be between 12,000 and 13,500 units, and ASP is expected to be between $440,000 and $450,000. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of home sales, are likely to be nearly 8% for the quarter.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderLennar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This makes the dividend yield 1.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. See our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. However, prior to this announcement, Oracle's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 49.8%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 29%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendOracle Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2012, the dividend has gone from $0.24 total annually to $1.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 18% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Has Growth PotentialThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Oracle has been growing its earnings per share at 6.6% a year over the past five years. Oracle definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Oracle Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Oracle might even raise payments in the future. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Oracle that investors should take into consideration.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying.Insider buying is a popular way to assess the potential of a company and can be a good indicator to gauge a stock's performance. When insiders, such as corporate officers, directors and large shareholders, buy shares of their own company, it is often seen as a sign of confidence in the future of the company. It is important to note that insider buying does not guarantee future success, but it can be a helpful indicator when researching potential investments.When looking for companies with insider buying activity, investors should focus on the size and frequency of the purchases. Insiders are required to disclose any stock purchases in regulatory filings, so investors can easily track this activity. It is important to note, however, that some insiders may be buying stock for a variety of reasons and not necessarily because they believe the stock will increase in value.Investors should also consider other factors such as the company’s fundamentals, financial health and industry trends when making investment decisions. While insider buying can be an important indicator of a company’s potential, it should not be the sole factor used when making an investment decision. Investors should also consider the company’s overall strategy and position in the market.2022 has shaken investors' confidence and proven to be a difficult year for equities. As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has lost over 15% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 28.5% for the year, and the Dow has shed 6% since the beginning of 2022. In the midst of strong inflation, high interest rates, supply disruptions, and inventory gluts, investors are left puzzled about where to park cash. In times like these, it may be useful to look at where the masses are pouring into, what stocks are on smart money's radars, and also what corporate executives have faith in their business. We have come up with a list of the 16 large-cap stocks that insiders have purchased over the past 30 days. These include CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG), and many others, all of which are discussed in detail below.Story continuesTop 10 Stock Picks of Ali Motamed's Invenomic Capital ManagementSource:PixabayOur MethodologyTo determine the 16 large-cap stocks with insider buying, we used our screener and went through insider purchases over the past 30 days.

However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation(NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”13.

The competitive environment appears to have increased more quickly than management has anticipated. We believe it is prudent to sell the entire position, as Ball is forced to reevaluate its growth strategy and shift its capital deployments.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this chipmaker have returned -7.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry, to which Micron belongs, has lost 11.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Micron is expected to post a loss of $0.02 per share, indicating a change of -100.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -72.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of -$0.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -106%. This estimate has changed -335% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.87 indicates a change of +673.6% from what Micron is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -18.6%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MU _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Micron, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -46.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.97 billion and $24.81 billion estimates indicate -44.8% and +46.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMicron reported revenues of $6.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.7%. EPS of $1.45 for the same period compares with $2.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.92 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.03%. The EPS surprise was +3.57%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Micron is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Micron. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Aon The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AonOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Eric Andersen, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$283 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$304). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 5.7% of Eric Andersen's holding.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 4.40k shares worth US$1.3m. On the other hand they divested 9.65k shares, for US$2.7m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Aon than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Story continuesDoes Aon Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Aon insiders own 1.1% of the company, currently worth about US$719m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Aon Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Aon, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Aon.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Those conversations include how the successor firm sticks to the ""road map"" drawn up as part of the deal, he said.""We are not talking about how they somehow participate in our business, this is already done,"" Vkusno &amp; tochka, which translates to ""Tasty &amp; that's it,"" CEO Oleg Paroev told Reuters. He made the remarks after announcing the upcoming launch of a new burger, the ""Big Hit"", an alternative to the Big Mac.""We are continuing to communicate with the corporation on the subject of the fact that we honestly carry out everything that we have promised to do,"" he said.In a statement to Reuters, McDonald's said it fully exited the Russian market earlier this year.""We remain focused on the purchaser's adherence to de-branding and their related commitments made in connection with the sale and exit of our business in the country,"" the Chicago-based chain said.Scores of Western companies have left Russia over its actions in Ukraine. McDonald's engineered a relatively smooth sale to Govor for an undisclosed fee, but stomached a non-cash charge of $1.4 billion and forfeited $300 million in annual operating income.While some brands have faced criticism for continuing to make money from Russia, McDonald's was one of the first to cease operations and ultimately abandon the market, signing a agreement with its successor, Vkusno &amp; tochka, details of which are only gradually emerging.Story continuesMaintaining contact with Vkusno &amp; tochka violates no sanctions, but it provides new detail into ongoing communications between the Chicago-based company and its Russian successor, which has now signed agreements with all former franchisees and was upbeat about sales prospects going into 2023.Govor said he fought off four other suitors for the assets, believing that having already operated franchised McDonald's locations in Siberia for around eight years had played in his favour.Russian authorities in June said McDonald's has an option to buy back its Russia restaurants within 15 years. McDonald's has not commented on whether it has an option to return to Russia.(Reporting by Alexander Marrow in Moscow and Hilary Russ in New York; Editing by Matt Scuffham, Vanessa O'Connell and Anna Driver)]"

At the same time, the Dow lost 2.25%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.25%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had gained 0.74% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.01% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.14% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from McDonald's as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect McDonald's to post earnings of $2.44 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.42%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.7 billion, down 5.2% from the year-ago period.MCD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.92 per share and revenue of $22.93 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +6.9% and -1.24%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.08% higher. McDonald's is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that McDonald's has a Forward P/E ratio of 27.68 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.5.Meanwhile, MCD's PEG ratio is currently 3.39. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MCD's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.27 as of yesterday's close.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 170, putting it in the bottom 33% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

In a recent interview after McDonald's third quarter earnings results, he emphasized, ""consumers are not necessarily pushing back on the higher prices.""""Bottom line is consumers still have to eat, so you're either eating at the grocery store or you're eating at restaurants...grocery store pricing is up more so than restaurant pricing. At this point, restaurants are actually providing a little bit more value than they have historically, ""he added.Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

If you want to see more best dividend stocks that outperformed in 2022, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Dividend stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends. Although not always the case, many dividend stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis as a way to return a share of their profits back to the owners. Given that a company's profit can increase or decrease depending on various factors, a company's dividend can also increase or decrease.2022 has been a challenging year for many companies given the higher inflation and the rising interest rates. As a result, many stocks have not done well this year and the market as a whole has declined. In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.2% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 6.77%, and the NASDAQ has retreated 28.9% in 2022 as of December 13.While the market hasn't done well, a percentage of the leading dividend stocks have outperformed the market this year. Some leading dividend stocks have outperformed because their businesses have pricing power and competitive advantages that make them relatively resistant to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. Other leading dividend stocks have rallied given investors expect their earnings per share to grow substantially in the future.Of the leading dividend stocks that have outperformed this year, many have increased their annual dividends to return even more capital back to shareholders.2023While November's core inflation data was lower than expected, many analysts still think the Federal Reserve will still raise interest rates further and that there is still a likely probability of a recession in 2023. According to a monthly survey of around 300 institutional investors who represent trillions in funds, for instance, 82% thought recession was the 'most likely' scenario in the coming months.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many stocks across many different sectors.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the S&amp;P 500's performance in 2022 that also had a dividend yield of over 1% as of December 13.We then ranked the dividend stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 202212. Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 3.80%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 3.65%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a leading pharmaceutical company based in Switerzerland that has increased its annual dividend per share for 25 straight years since its creation in 1996. As a result of the increases, Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) has a dividend yield of 3.65% as of December 13, which when added to its year to date return of 3.8% yields a fairly attractive return given that the S&amp;P 500 declined 16.2% in the year.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 26 were long Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #12 on our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022.Alongside McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a dividend stock that has outperformed the market in 2022.11. Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.84%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 3.21%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), the owner of Burger King, has outperformed the market given its year to date rally of 11.84% and its dividend yield of 3.21%.Although inflation has been a headwind for many companies this year, the higher prices have not affected Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) given the company's strong earnings. For Q3, Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) reported EPS of $1.17 on sales of $1.73 billion versus the consensus of $0.80 on revenue of $1.66 billion. Q3 global comparable sales rose 9% year over year.10. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 10.68%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 4.38%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a tech stock that has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ, which are down 16.2% and 28.9% in 2022, respectively. Given its rally of 10.68%, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has also outperformed many big tech companies too.One potential reason for the strong performance could be International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) expects free cash flow of around $10 billion this year which makes its dividend yield of 4.38% relatively safe if the company can maintain or grow the metric in the future.9. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.28%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 0.95%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) is a leading railroad whose stock has rallied 11.28% this year given increasing demand. For Q3 2022, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 while total revenues increased 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) also has a dividend yield of 0.95% as of 12/13.Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8. Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 4.24%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 1.69%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) is another Canadian railroad that has outperformed the market given strong demand.

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 36.33%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the better performing dividend stocks in 2022 given its surge of 36.33% year to date. With the Ukraine Russia war, it is likely U.S. defense spending will likely continue to increase and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) could potentially benefit if it maintains its market share.Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) certainty has substantial technical expertise given it is the maker of the B-21, which is the successor to the B-2. The company has a dividend yield of 1.32% as of December 13.6.

This innovative aggregation of a major company purchasing power jointly with its logistics partners means the electricity load of McDonald's USA's entire logistics supply chain for all its U.S. restaurants is expected to be 100% supported by renewable energy.(PRNewsfoto/Enel North America)The Blue Jay solar project is expected to be fully operational in 2023. Once complete, McDonald's and its suppliers' combined electricity purchase is expected to amount to an estimated average of over 470,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually. This is equivalent to avoiding over 170,000 metric tons of carbon emissions annually or the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from over 80 million trucking miles driven each year2.""Adding Blue Jay solar to our U.S. renewable energy portfolio is one of the many important steps in our journey to achieving our net zero aspirations,"" said Bob Stewart, SVP and Chief Supply Chain Officer, North America, at McDonald's. ""This deal is a unique example of how McDonald's and its logistics partners are combining efforts to leverage their reach and scale to tackle supply chain emissions together. We are excited about our collective potential to help address climate change and drive continuous improvement.""Supply chain emissions, which are categorized as Scope 3 emissions by GHG Protocol, are challenging to address and measure because they're driven by activities that are beyond the direct control of the organization, such as the transportation and distribution of products. Scope 3 emissions account for 75% of companies' GHG emissions on average, according to 2022 report released by CDP.Story continues""While major corporations are increasingly encouraging and advising their partners on how to reduce their carbon emissions, McDonald's took it one step further by becoming the anchor buyer alongside its suppliers. McDonald's and the NALC recognized early on that collaboration across the supply chain is the only way to effectively address electricity emissions for all logistics suppliers,"" said Danny Fahey, NALC Sustainability Lead and Vice President of U.S. Strategy at Martin Brower. ""This aggregation represents how a joint effort will be essential to making continued progress towards climate goals.""The combined purchase of 189 megawatts (MW) of renewable power, equivalent to more than 900 U.S. McDonald's restaurants-worth of renewable energy annually, is intended to help McDonald's and the NALC members meet their ambitious climate commitments.""This innovative deal demonstrates how Enel is helping major companies take a hands-on approach in helping their partners decarbonize their operations,"" said Paolo Romanacci, head of Enel North America's renewable energy business, Enel Green Power. ""We're honored to be part of such a monumental deal and look forward to helping McDonald's and its suppliers achieve their supply chain emission reduction goals through this tailored solution.""Enel, McDonald's and its suppliers are committed to creating long-term value in the local communities surrounding the Blue Jay solar project. The companies signed a mutual letter of intent to participate in Enel's Premium Offer program and co-develop community investment projects that align with the core values of each company.Approximately 275 jobs have been created during the construction phase and the project is expected to generate more than $41 million in new tax revenue over its operating life for state taxing entities. Furthermore, Enel has committed over $216,500 to fund STEM and upskilling programs for local schools and colleges since the start of the project's construction in May 2021. The Blue Jay project also includes an 88.2 MWh battery energy storage system, which will help support the reliability of the local energy grid.The buyer aggregation was facilitated by Coho Climate Advisors.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Prologis'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Prologis How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.11 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROEAt first glance, Prologis seems to have a decent ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Probably as a result of this, Prologis was able to see a decent growth of 17% over the last five years.We then compared Prologis' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 12% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is PLD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PLD is currently mispriced by the market.Is Prologis Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Prologis has a high three-year median payout ratio of 51%. This means that it has only 49% of its income left to reinvest into its business. However, it's not unusual to see a REIT with such a high payout ratio mainly due to statutory requirements. In spite of this, the company was able to grow its earnings by a fair bit, as we saw above.Moreover, Prologis is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 107% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 6.6%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Prologis' performance. We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE. While the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's probably a good sign. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

329,1e1296bc-f7b7-307e-b4f8-03dfc4698565,RHI,2022-12-16,Investing in Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI) five years ago would have delivered you a 45% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-robert-half-international-nyse-114408630.html,1671191048,STORY,['RHI'],"[The main point of investing for the long term is to make money. But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 32% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 31% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Robert Half International To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Robert Half International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 6% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 11.54 also suggests market apprehension.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Robert Half International has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Robert Half International, it has a TSR of 45% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 19% in the twelve months, Robert Half International shareholders did even worse, losing 30% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 8% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Robert Half International   (of which 1 is concerning!) you should know about.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

331,35eedc46-6f11-3a60-9926-e35e088d8b6a,PCAR,2022-12-16,4 High Earnings Yield Picks to Tide Over the Rising Rate Milieu,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-high-earnings-yield-picks-123812456.html,1671107892,STORY,"['CNHI', '^GSPC', 'PCAR', 'SLCA']","[In the last couple of years, inflation has soared to 40-year highs, thanks to the deadly pandemic, disrupted supply chain systems and the Russia-Ukraine war. To combat the stubborn inflation, the Federal Reserve adopted a contractionary monetary policy stance. While Fed’s aggressive rate hikes are helping to cool down inflation gradually (as evident by the latest CPI reading), it remains near a 40-year high. However, it has declined from the peak of 9.1% attained in June.  Per the latest data, consumer prices rose 7.1% year over year in November, down from 7.7% in October. Despite the encouraging data, the Fed seems to be in no mood to ease its fight against inflation just yet.Yesterday, the Fed jacked up interest rates by 50 bps, breaking the string of four consecutive 75 bps point hikes but marking the seventh rate hike this year. That raised the Fed’s benchmark rate to a range of 4.25-4.5% — the highest rate in 15 years.A 50-bps interest rate hike was very much expected.  But what didn’t go down well with the market participants was the fact that there would be further rate hikes ahead and no cuts till 2024. The central banks signaled to keep the interest rates higher for longer through 2023. Fed Chair Powell said, “The inflation data received so far in October and November show a welcome reduction in the pace of price increases, but it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence inflation is on a sustained downward path.”The FOMC still has a long way to go to rein in inflation and the economy isn't out of the woods just yet. Notably, the FOMC has lowered its GDP growth projection for 2023 from 1.2% to 0.5%. As such, market volatility is here to stay.Focus on Value InvestingIn this hair-trigger market, value investing could be one of the most effective investment approaches. The strategy basically seeks to profit from investing in fundamentally strong stocks that appear to be trading at a discount to their intrinsic values. Value investors benefit from identifying and buying stocks that are underestimated by the equity market and are thus trading below their true value, and eventually make handsome returns when the stock price rises toward its intrinsic value to reflect actual fundamentals.Story continuesWhile the P/E ratio is generally regarded as one of the most popular valuation metrics, there’s another interesting ratio that you can consider for ferreting out attractively valued stocks. And that is earnings yield. Consider unlocking your portfolio value with these four high-earnings yield stocks — U.S. Silica Holdings SLCA, PACCAR PCAR, CNH Industrial CNHI and Sociedad Quimica Y Minera SQM.Is Earnings Yield a Better Alternative to P/E?Earnings yield is useful for investors concerned about the rate of return on investment. This metric, expressed in percentage, is calculated as annual earnings per share (EPS) divided by market price — the inverse of the P/E ratio. Firms with higher earnings yield are considered underpriced, while those with lower earnings yield are seen as overpriced. Earnings yield captures both the tangible and intangible yield of a firm, as opposed to dividend yield, which only considers the tangible yield.It should be noted that earnings yield is an important tool for investors with exposure to both stocks and bonds. In fact, with regard to this, earnings yield can be more illuminating than the traditional P/E ratio, as the former facilitates the comparison of stocks with fixed-income securities. For instance, when the yield of the market index is more than the 10-year Treasury yield, stocks can be considered as undervalued than bonds. In this situation, investing in the stock market would be a better option for a value investor.The Winning StrategyWe have set Earnings Yield greater than 10% as our primary screening criterion but it alone cannot be used for picking stocks that have the potential of generating solid returns. So, we have added the following parameters to the screen:Estimated EPS growth for the next 12 months greater than or equal to the S&amp;P 500: This metric compares the 12-month forward EPS estimate with the 12-month actual EPS.Average Daily Volume (20 Days) greater than or equal to 100,000: High trading volume implies that a stock has adequate liquidity.Current Price greater than or equal to $5.Buy-Rated Stocks: Stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have been known to outperform peers in any type of market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our PicksHere we discuss four of the 119 stocks that qualified the screen:U.S. Silica: Based in Maryland, Silica Holdings makes and markets commercial silica, a specialized mineral, to a variety of attractive end markets in the United States. U.S. Silica should gain from its expansion actions in the Permian Basin.

PCAR's accelerated efforts toward electrification and connected vehicle services are set to boost prospects.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PCAR’s 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth 53.2% and 3%, respectively.

SQM is gaining from favorable trends in the lithium market underpinned by strong electric vehicle sales. The expansion of lithium operations is supporting the company’s lithium sales volumes. Strong demand and limited supply are boosting lithium prices, driving the firm’s top line.The company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SQM’s 2022 and 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth 540% and 17%, respectively.

But now, the trend seems to have reversed, just in time for the busy holiday travel season.According to motoring and leisure travel giant AAA, the average price of regular gas) in the U.S. currently sits at $3.214 per gallon, which is below the $3.323 per gallon we saw this time last year.Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at fuel price tracker GasBuddy, sees the trend continuing as Americans prepare to hit the road for the holidays.In a recent Fox Business interview, the host asked De Haan whether the national average price of regular gas could drop below $3 a gallon.His answer was positive.“I think that certainly looks like a very good possibility here, probably as early as December 23,” he said.And since rising gas prices drove up inflation earlier on, falling gas prices might help bring it down.“This is where there’s some deflation happening,” De Haan added.De Hann is not the only one seeing inflation slowing down. Goldman Sachs strategists have a similar view.“Our economists expect by early 2023 it will become clear that inflation is decelerating and the Fed will reduce the magnitude of hikes and eventually cease tightening,” Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a recent note to investors.The investment bank also identified a list of stocks that tend to outperform in a falling inflation environment. Here’s a look at three of them.Don't missUBS says 61% of millionaire collectors allocate up to 30% of their overall portfolio to this exclusive asset classThe average home insurance policy is nearly 40% higher than it was 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)AT&amp;TLet’s start with a household name.AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. More than 100 million consumers in the U.S. use its mobile and broadband services. At the same time, the company also serves nearly all of the Fortune 1000 companies with connectivity and smart solutions.Story continuesAnd because wireless and internet services are essential for the modern economy, AT&amp;T generates recurring business through thick and thin.The company pays quarterly dividends of 27.75 cents per share, translating to an annual yield of 5.8%.Considering that the average S&amp;P 500 company yields just 1.6% at the moment, AT&amp;T could be worth a look for income-seeking investors.Read more: Grow your hard-earned cash without the shaky stock market using these easy alternativesUnited Parcel ServiceE-commerce has been one of the fastest-growing segments in the market, and the stay-at-home environment induced by the pandemic only made online shopping more popular.But it’s freight companies like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) that made e-commerce possible in the first place.UPS posted solid financial results for Q3, as consolidated revenue grew 4.2% year-over-year to $24.2 billion. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings per share rose 10.3% to $2.99.Shares are down 14% in 2022, but a potentially strong holiday quarter could bring back some investor enthusiasm.

Shares are down 23% in 2022 and 43% over the past five years.But the company is on Goldman Sachs’ list.That’s likely because while Walgreens shares have fallen, its payout to shareholders has been on the rise. In July, the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 0.5% to 48 cents per share, marking its 47th consecutive annual dividend increase.Looking further back, you’ll see that the retail pharmacy giant has paid uninterrupted dividends for more than 89 years.

(NYSE:UPS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-united-140037601.html,1671112837,STORY,['UPS'],"[Let's talk about the popular United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on United Parcel Service’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service Is United Parcel Service Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, United Parcel Service seems to be fairly priced at around 5.50% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy United Parcel Service today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $174.70, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that United Parcel Service’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from United Parcel Service?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of United Parcel Service, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 1.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in UPS’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on UPS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for United Parcel Service (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) you should know about.If you are no longer interested in United Parcel Service, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for American Express American Express Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, Stephen Squeri, for US$8.6m worth of shares, at about US$178 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$150. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in American Express than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like American Express better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.American Express Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at American Express. insider Walter Clayton spent US$149k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. American Express insiders own about US$129m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About American Express Insiders?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. However, the longer term transactions are not so encouraging. Overall, we'd prefer see a more sustained buying from directors, but with a significant insider holding and more recent purchases, American Express insiders are reasonably well aligned, and optimistic for the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of American Express.But note: American Express may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

I'll now turn the call over to George.George Kurian: Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 FY 2023 earnings call. Coming off a strong Q1, our team delivered a solid quarter, with all-time highs for Q2 billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income, and EPS. We remain focused on disciplined operational management and the execution of our strategy, which is tightly aligned with customer priorities. On today's call, I will walk through four topics; one, we delivered a good quarter in a dynamic environment. However, we are disappointed with the deceleration of growth in our cloud services. Our conviction in the cloud opportunity and our ability to execute against it is unwavering. Two, we are aligned with the durable, megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations.We continue to deliver innovation that furthers our already strong position. Three, we believe strongly in the opportunity ahead, but have slightly tempered our revenue outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, due to near-term macro headwinds. Four, we understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a slowing environment and will focus on our strategic growth opportunities, while continually optimizing our operating costs. Let's start with the first point, our performance in the quarter. Q2 public cloud segment revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $142 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate remained healthy at 140%. However, Public Cloud ARR of $603 million fell short of our expectations. As our cloud partners discussed on their earnings calls, growth has slowed as customers look to optimize cloud spending.This macro-related optimization caused some slowing of growth in our cloud storage services as well. Additionally, we had a few customers with very large project-based workloads like chip design, that came to their natural conclusion, resulting in capacity reductions in those environments. We expect these customers to kick off new projects early next calendar year, as the number of cloud customers and their usage of our cloud services grows, the impact of this type of workload will be smoothed over a much broader customer base. In our cloud operations portfolio, Spot is benefiting from the same desire to optimize cloud spending that was a headwind to our cloud storage services. Spot's value proposition is a strong engine for new logo acquisition and Q2 saw an acceleration of new Spot customer additions from Q1.As we've discussed on past calls, we continue to refine our approach to cloud insights and are seeing early positive signs, with the growth of new Cloud Insights customers in Q2. We continue to see healthy growth of new-to-NetApp customers and of existing NetApp enterprise customers adopting our cloud services and those customers are growing in scale as well. The number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR has more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our public cloud services are highly differentiated and create customer preference for NetApp. We have a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors in this critical market, positioning us well to deliver sustained growth. Compared to Q2 a year ago, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 3% and our all-flash array business increased 2% to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion.Adjusting for the significant FX headwinds, Hybrid Cloud grew 8% and all-flash grew 7% in constant currency. All flash penetration of our installed base grew to 33% of installed systems. Our lower cost, capacity-oriented all-flash arrays and FAS hybrid flash arrays, both performed well. Onto the second point, our alignment to the industry megatrends and our continued innovation. The world is moving faster than ever, raising data-driven digital and cloud transformations to business necessities. NetApp helps meet these objectives with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management that we term the evolved cloud. We provide customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, which increases our relevance and value to our customers.We believe strongly in the sizeable, durable, and growing opportunity created by these megatrends. As many of you know, we bring significant value to customers running VMware environments on-premises. With a series of announcements made in conjunction with VMware, we are now able to bring that same value to customers in the cloud. Our native cloud storage service integrated with VMware, helps customers quickly, easily, and cost effectively migrate enterprise workloads to the cloud and accelerate modern application development using Kubernetes. We are the only certified and supported third-party cloud storage solution for VMware Cloud, which creates significant new opportunity for us. As those VMware environments move to the cloud, we can capture the data that resides on competitors' on-premises systems.At the start of November, we introduced BlueXP, the next big step in fulfilling our vision to give customers the simplicity, security, savings, and sustainability needed for an evolved cloud. It delivers true hybrid, multi-cloud operations by bringing storage and data services together in a single, unified control plane. BlueXP is a highly differentiated solution that enables customers to deploy, discover, manage, and optimize not only infrastructure and data, but supporting business processes across multiple clouds and on-premises environments. In addition to bringing forward technical capabilities, we are helping customers achieve their environmental goals by creating energy efficient products. We have added power and temperature reporting in Cloud Insights to give customers a real-time view into energy expenditure and our carbon footprint reports provide a reasonable estimate for the carbon impact of their NetApp systems.We enhanced our storage efficiency with a 4:1 efficiency guarantee for SAN workloads to help customers minimize their storage footprint and lower energy usage. We not only help customers practice sound environmental stewardship, we practice it ourselves. I am proud to announce that EcoVadis, the leading evidence-based ESG rating agency, awarded NetApp a gold ranking, placing us within the top 7% of evaluated companies. Now the third point, the macro environment and our business outlook. As we moved through the quarter, we saw increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals moving out of the quarter. In Q2, we felt this most acutely in the Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors.We see no change to our underlying opportunity and are confident in our position. However, current economic realities and unprecedented FX headwinds are and will continue to impact IT spending, causing us to temper our revenue expectations for the second half. And finally, point four, driving shareholder value. In response to the slowing top line, we are being agile and taking action to lower operating expenses. Already, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze, and are reducing discretionary spending, as well as further optimizing our real estate footprint. We will remain disciplined as we continue to shift resources away from lower yield activities to our biggest opportunities. In closing, we are clearly aligned with our customers' strategic priorities and remain confident in our long-term opportunity, despite the current external headwinds.By focusing on what we can control, we will aggressively seek to maximize the near-term return on our product and services portfolio, while leveraging our leadership position in all-flash, cloud storage, and cloud infrastructure optimization. I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for delivering a strong first half. In a challenging environment, we remain focused on innovation, execution, and operational discipline. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.See also 16 Best Dividend Stocks of 2022 and 22 Most Charitable Companies in 2022Mike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we delivered a strong Q2 in a dynamic environment, with all-time Q2 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. Number two, we have adjusted our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year due to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number three, as we navigate through the current macro environment, we are laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. As George noted, we have taken actions to reduce our full year expense envelope and will remain fluid in assessing further opportunities to take costs out of the business.Number four, as a result of these cost savings measures, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen, since our Q1 call; and number five, we continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause Cloud Operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23. We now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 Free Cash Flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted.Q2 billings were $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.66 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 540 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 9% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q2, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the six points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $837 million increased 3% year-over-year. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $607 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $603 million, up 55% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million, up 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $749 million was up 11% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency, constituting 45% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $4.1 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year, or 10% in constant currency. Q2 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66.3%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q2, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a three-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%.Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was accretive to the corporate average for the eighth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q2 highlighted the strong leverage in our business model, with operating margin of 24%, including two-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.48 came in nicely ahead of guidance and included a $0.21 year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $214 million and free cash flow was $137 million. Q2 included our annual repatriation tax payment and continued cash outflows for certain inventory and premiums for constrained trailing edge analog parts.Additionally, collections were lower than expected due to a backend loaded quarter for invoicing linearity that you see in the higher accounts receivable balance. Our component purchasing strategy allows us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but remains a clear headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through the second half of fiscal '23. During Q2, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $258 million to shareholders, representing 188% of free cash flow. Share count of 220 million was down 4% year-over-year.We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. Additionally, currency headwinds have only continued to increase. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes five points of FX headwind versus the four-point headwind assumed in our prior guidance. We now expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of approximately $700 million, which equates to our Public Cloud segment driving three-points of total company revenue growth for the full year. Three drivers are impacting the near-term growth rate of Cloud ARR. Number one, in this macro environment, we project continued optimization of storage services, as we help our customers manage their spending, which benefits Spot, but will offset some incremental near-term storage services ARR.Number two, we expect that project-based workloads will grow in both number and scale, but as they ramp, it will take some time to materialize into sizable ARR; and number three, we continue to tighten up the Cloud Insights sales motion, but we don't expect this meaningful cross-sell opportunity to materialize until we head into fiscal '24. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring cost at significant premiums. We should also see a benefit from declining NAND prices in Q4.While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 23%, which now includes approximately two points of FX headwind and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50, which now includes more than $0.70 of currency impacts. It's important to reiterate that we are offsetting the full year revenue adjustment with an extremely disciplined approach to our spending envelope. As a result, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year.From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of Fiscal 2023, as we sharpen our portfolio focus by refining the Cloud Insight value proposition and sales motion, accelerating the integration of Spot and CloudCheckr into a single FinOps suite, and driving the successful integration of Instaclustr. As I said earlier, we now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 1% decrease year-over-year, or 4% growth in constant currency. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 22% and 23%.We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is net interest income of $5 million and a share count of approximately 220 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such a dynamic environment. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&amp;A.

The plan includes adding two new combined-cycle natural gas plants, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation, 125 megawatts of battery storage and more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs.In conjunction with the announcement, LG&amp;E and KU is seeking approval from the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) for the replacement generation and new energy efficiency programs. LG&amp;E and KU's proposal focuses on meeting customers' energy needs in the most reliable, least-cost fashion.""This is about delivering on our mission to provide safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to our customers,"" said Vincent Sorgi, PPL president and chief executive officer. ""The plan we filed today is a balanced approach that will help ensure our ability to reliably serve our customers' energy needs 24/7, while at the same time further diversifying our generation portfolio.""The proposed replacement strategy, if approved by the KPSC, represents $2.1 billion of total capital investment in Kentucky. This includes building two 621-megawatt natural gas combined-cycle units, building a 120-megawatt solar array, acquiring another 120-megawatt array to be developed by a third-party and constructing 125 megawatts of battery storage. The LG&amp;E and KU plan also includes securing power purchase agreements for more than 600 megawatts of additional solar generation and adding 14 new energy efficiency offerings to help reduce electricity demand in the state. The proposed energy efficiency program, developed in collaboration with community partners, would reduce LG&amp;E and KU's overall need for future generation by nearly 200 megawatts.Story continuesSorgi said the plan is consistent with PPL's goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The replacement strategy, if approved, would reduce the carbon intensity of LG&amp;E and KU's generation fleet and result in nearly a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions from existing levels.LG&amp;E and KU have requested approval from the KPSC by Oct. 1, 2023.

All the above factors saw drastic shifts in 2022 and drove energy prices higher, making the oil industry one of the top-performing industries tracked by Zacks. Today we will explore potential outcomes for 2023 and three key oil stocks to watch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Energy ETF XLE illustrates the outperformance energy has enjoyed this year.OPECThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) plays a prominent role in global oil production. Though OPEC is not a monopoly, the cartel controls a huge slice of worldwide oil production. Unsurprisingly, as oil prices rose in 2022, OPEC was not ready to drastically increase production. OPEC has cut production in recent months citing a slower-growing global economy. While the price has drifted lower, it remains much higher than it was a year ago.GeopoliticsIn February, Russia invaded Ukraine, causing oil prices to soar. Eight months have elapsed since that time, and there is no end in sight. Not only has the war impacted those in the region, but it has also affected the global energy market. As many condemned the Russian aggression, countries such as the United States began to levy sanctions on Russian oil. Despite other countries trying to pick up the slack, the oil supply has taken a big hit, and production disruptions are likely to persist.Supply &amp; DemandDomestic producers in the United States have yet to respond to the need for more production. Some of the largest oil producers in the United States are producing less oil than they did back in 2019. Oil producers are tepid to start new drilling against the current backdrop of a slowing economy, push for clean energy and ESG practices, and a pause on new oil and gas leases by the Biden administration. Below are 3 Stocks that will Benefit if Oil Stays Strong in 2023:Story continuesHaliburton HALis one of the largest oilfield services providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and construction services to the energy sector. Over the past few years, the company has executed from an earnings standpoint at a very high level. In fact, the oil juggernaut produced earnings surprises every quarter in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Haliburton boasts a Zacks Ranking of 1 and is part of the best-in-class Oil and Gas – Field Services Group (a top 7% ranked group by Zacks).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Haliburton has consistently exceeded earnings expectations.Like Haliburton, Schlumberger SLB is part of the highly ranked Oil and Gas – Field Services Group. Schlumberger helps upstream energy players to locate oil and gas and provides other services, such as project management. SLB has grown at a pace of 60% or more for five straight quarters and has accompanied the earnings growth with double-digit revenue growth. SLB sports strong growth and the highest possible Zack’s Ranking of 1. If oil remains elevated, SLB is a best-in-class name.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: SLB is slated to continue its strong EBITDA growth in 2023.Occidental Petroleum OXYis a Texas-based oil and gas exploration and production company. OXY is part of the Oil and Gas – Integrated group, a top 38% ranked group by Zacks. Like SLB and HAL, OXY has produced strong fundamental results in recent quarters. Last quarter, the company reported EPS which grew 180% year-over-year on revenue growth of 39%. Though OXY has a mid-level Zack’s Ranking of 3, the stock is worth watching. Legendary investor Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has been piling into shares and has the authorization to purchase up to 50% of the company’s shares. Though the stock has underperformed in recent weeks, it is pulling into its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly a year.

The Dow Industrial, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 plunged 6.5%, 28.6% and 16.2%, respectively, in the year to date.With the turn of the year approaching, the global economy continues to grapple with several macroeconomic challenges. The obstacles include supply-chain issues due to acute shortage of chips and other input components, labor shortages, currency fluctuations, Russia-Ukraine invasion led energy price hikes and a constant fear of recessionary uncertainty.Also, the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes to combat the raging inflation further intensify the vulnerability of interest-sensitive stocks.Despite these headwinds, we believe that stocks with strong momentum in the near term with a favorable Zacks Rank are likely to be the ideal combination of investments. Five such stocks are Sanofi SNY, GSK plc GSK, Ulta Beauty Inc. ULTA, United Airlines UAL and United Therapeutics UTHR.Momentum investing calls for a continued appraisal of stocks, which ensures that an investor does not pick a beaten-down name or overlook a thriving one.

343,59083c44-4127-360c-b398-6d4c2da01002,VRTX,2022-12-16,Getting In Cheap On Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) Is Unlikely,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/getting-cheap-vertex-pharmaceuticals-incorporated-110037698.html,1671188437,STORY,['VRTX'],"[Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 24.2x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Vertex Pharmaceuticals certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals.How Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Vertex Pharmaceuticals' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 52% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 52% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 9.1% each year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.2% each year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Our examination of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, sending the high P/E lower. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Having said that, be aware  Vertex Pharmaceuticals is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Vertex Pharmaceuticals, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (AMS:CCEP) share price is up 50% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 32% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 9.3% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, it has a TSR of 74% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Coca-Cola Europacific Partners shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 9.3% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 12% a year, is even better. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE:WM) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-waste-management-inc-110034523.html,1671188434,STORY,['WM'],"[Does the December share price for Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Waste Management The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.96bUS$2.70bUS$3.04bUS$3.13bUS$3.21bUS$3.28bUS$3.35bUS$3.42bUS$3.49bUS$3.56bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x12Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 2.41%Est @ 2.28%Est @ 2.19%Est @ 2.13%Est @ 2.08%Est @ 2.05% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$1.8kUS$2.3kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$21bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.6b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$67bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$67b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$33bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$54b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$163, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.972. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Waste ManagementStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

""Public interest is served if SoCalGas begins conducting a feasibility study of the Project immediately.""SoCalGas to join members of the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) in support of the State of California's application for historic federal funds to support regional hydrogen hubsLOS ANGELES, Dec. 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has approved Southern California Gas Co.'s (SoCalGas') request to track costs for advancing the first phase of Angeles Link, a proposed green hydrogen pipeline system that could deliver clean, reliable, renewable energy to the Los Angeles region. As envisioned, Angeles Link could be the nation's largest green hydrogen pipeline system and support significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from electric generation, industrial processes, heavy-duty trucks, and other hard-to-electrify sectors of the Southern California economy.In a final decision, the CPUC declared, ""the public interest is served if SoCalGas begins conducting a feasibility study of the Project immediately."" The agency also asked SoCalGas to join members of the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) in support of California's application for a share of $8 billion in available federal funds to support regional hydrogen hubs.""California has some of the boldest climate and clean air goals in the nation. The proposed Angeles Link aligns SoCalGas' scale, 150 years of expertise in service, and our highly skilled workforce with the clean energy and environmental policies that will shape this century,"" said SoCalGas Chief Executive Officer, Scott Drury. ""As the CPUC's decision highlights, Angeles Link has the potential to support decarbonization for hard-to-electrify sectors of our economy, improve our air quality, bring new economic opportunities as well as sustain and grow skilled jobs to our region.""Story continues""As the chair of the California Senate Select Committee on Hydrogen Energy, it is my goal to help California continue serving as a national and global leader in clean hydrogen development so we can reach our clean energy and zero emission vehicle goals,"" said California Senator Bob Archuleta (D-Pico Rivera). ""This decision on Angeles Link by the CPUC advances California's leadership on hydrogen and better positions the state to secure billions in federal funding opportunities via ARCHES.""Proposed in February of this year, Angeles Link would serve hard-to-electrify industries like dispatchable electric generation, heavy duty trucking and industrial processes. As contemplated, Angeles Link would deliver green hydrogen in an amount equivalent to almost 25% of the natural gas SoCalGas delivers today. In serving those industries, Angeles Link's green hydrogen could:Displace up to 3 million gallons of diesel fuel per day, or 1 billion gallons annually, and enable conversion of up to four natural gas power plants to run on clean renewable hydrogen.Eliminate nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) equal to removing 3.1 million cars off the road annually.Generate billions of dollars in new clean energy investments in the LA Basin and create thousands of new union jobs.Over time and combined with other future clean energy projects, Angeles Link could also help reduce natural gas demand served by the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, facilitating its ultimate retirement, while continuing reliable and affordable energy service to the region.Consensus Grows: Clean Renewable Hydrogen Key to Reaching California's, Nation's Climate GoalsThere is growing recognition among experts and policymakers that a broad set of tools will be needed to achieve California's climate and clean air goals by mid-century, including electrification, clean fuels like renewable natural gas and clean renewable hydrogen, and carbon management.The California Air Resources Board's (CARB's) recent Scoping Plan calls for scaling up, ""new options such as renewable hydrogen for hard-to-electrify end uses"" in its roadmap to decarbonize California. The federal government has also signaled that clean renewable hydrogen will play a key role in a clean-energy future, with billions of dollars in funding becoming available to develop clean renewable hydrogen hubs.The Angeles Link project could extend California's position as a leader on clean energy well into the future, while potentially helping to attract billions of dollars in new investment and maintaining and creating thousands of skilled jobs.""Green hydrogen is an important pathway to reach our goal of zero-emissions cargo operations at the Port,"" said Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka. ""The Port and our terminal partners have five active hydrogen demonstration projects and, ultimately, Angeles Link can play a key role in providing green hydrogen at the scale needed to achieve our zero-emissions and decarbonization goals by 2030.""""This decision demonstrates that California is a clear leader in paving the way for clean energy infrastructure while ensuring good union jobs for members like Utility Workers Local 483 and our union brothers and sisters alike,"" said Ernie Shaw, President UWUA Local 483, AFL-CIO.""For the tens of thousands of skilled workers who build California's natural gas system, green hydrogen represents real and meaningful opportunities to participate in the state's clean energy transition,"" said Rodney Cobos of the Southern California Pipe Trades Council. ""California's energy workers are among the most skilled and experienced in the nation, and it's important that they are ready and prepared to build the hydrogen infrastructure that projects like Angeles Link will facilitate. That's why we're glad to see that studying workforce planning and training will be a critical component of Angeles Link's next phase.""""Green hydrogen looks promising as a form of long-duration energy storage that could enhance electric system reliability and as a fuel that can help California reach its net zero-carbon goals for industrial end uses that currently have no practical alternatives to the use of natural gas,"" said Jan Smutny Jones of Independent Energy Producers. ""Establishing the memorandum account is a critical first step toward determining whether green hydrogen can supplement or replace natural gas and reduce carbon emissions from end uses that are hard to electrify.""""The California Hydrogen Business Council is pleased with the California Public Utilities Commission decision to allow SoCalGas to begin incurring costs to study the feasibility of a purpose-built hydrogen pipeline,"" said Katrina M. Fritz, Executive Director of the California Hydrogen Business Council. ""A common carrier pipeline would ensure transparent market access for hydrogen producers at all scales. The growth of this market is a necessary pathway for California to achieve deep decarbonization, as outlined in the recent update to the California Air Resources Board 2022 Scoping Plan for Achieving Carbon Neutrality.""""Angeles Link is a robust project that will significantly reduce the need for fossil-based natural gas and Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles,"" said Kathryn Barger, who represents Los Angeles County's Fifth Supervisorial District. ""I support efforts to move feasible projects forward that reduce emissions and the need for Aliso Canyon without jeopardizing grid reliability – or the good jobs and important businesses – that depend on the natural gas system. Angeles Link is a win-win for Los Angeles businesses and residents.""""A hydrogen infrastructure project of this scale could help catalyze the market for clean hydrogen in California and across the Western United States,"" said Laura Parkan, Vice President, Hydrogen Energy Americas for Air Liquide N.A. ""Our Nevada facility – currently the largest liquid hydrogen plant in the world – is already supplying the California transportation market, so a project of this scale will be another significant step forward for our hydrogen future.""""Hydrogen is creating the next infrastructure boom in the U.S.,"" said Tracy Hernandez, Founding CEO of the Los Angeles County Business Federation (BizFed). ""Estimates show green hydrogen alone could generate approximately $140 billion in revenue and support 700,000 jobs nationally by 2030. Angeles Link better positions Los Angeles to capture that revenue and benefit from those jobs.""""Projects like the Angeles Link are vital to broader adoption of zero emission technologies across the state,"" said Craig Scott, Group Manager in Toyota's Fuel Cell Solutions Group. ""Securing reliable and affordable supplies of green hydrogen allows companies like Toyota to develop next generation hydrogen fuel cell technologies for use in a variety of applications, such as our fuel cell electric vehicle powertrain for heavy-duty transport.""""Securing a reliable and affordable supply of green hydrogen into the Los Angeles region, paired with more funding for zero emissions heavy-duty truck technology conversion, would enable more truck fleet owners and operators to transition their vehicles,"" said Matt Schrap, CEO of Harbor Trucking Association. ""This decision by the CPUC to advance the Angeles Link is a crucial step towards making the transition a reality.""Growing Portfolio of Sustainability, Hydrogen InnovationSoCalGas is a leader in sustainability, having announced its aim to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. It is the first large natural gas utility in the United States to do so. As part of SoCalGas' net-zero strategy, the company is developing an industry-leading portfolio of clean fuels demonstration projects with collaborators from private industry, the US Department of Energy and California Energy Commission, and leading research institutions such as the University of California, Irvine, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. More than a dozen hydrogen pilot projects are already underway across the company.In September, SoCalGas announced a proposed collaboration with the University of California, Irvine, to demonstrate how electrolytic hydrogen can be safely blended into existing natural gas infrastructure on the university's campus – an important next step in establishing a statewide injection standard for renewable hydrogen.SoCalGas is also constructing a clean renewable hydrogen microgrid as part of its [H2] Innovation Experience. The [H2] Innovation Experience is a proof-of-concept project for resilient, clean energy using an electrolyzer to convert solar energy to clean renewable hydrogen and a fuel cell to supply electricity to a home, neighborhood, or campus community – independent of the electric grid. Earlier this month, the project was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council - Los Angeles' (USGBC-LA) Sustainable Innovation Award which recognized SoCalGas' commitments to sustainability through projects that demonstrate exemplary performance. The project was also named a World-Changing Idea in North America by Fast Company in 2021. Angeles Link – Phase One and Next StepsThe CPUC's approval of SoCalGas' Angeles Link memorandum account application allows the company to track costs of performing Phase One feasibility studies for the project. Phase One activities include preliminary engineering, design, along with studies of supply, demand, possible end users, pipeline configuration and storage solutions, environmental considerations, workforce planning and training, robust stakeholder outreach, and an analysis of project alternatives.""We're excited to have reached this important milestone and are grateful to the Commission and to leaders from labor, environmental organizations, government, and the private sector who are working together on the critical building blocks of California's clean renewable hydrogen economy,"" Drury said. ""We look forward to supporting California in its application for federal hydrogen hub funding and continuing the robust, transparent and collaborative engagement process that has been a hallmark of the Angeles Link proposal from the start.""For the latest information about Angeles Link, visit https://www.socalgas.com/angeleslink.About SoCalGasHeadquartered in Los Angeles, SoCalGas® is the largest gas distribution utility in the United States.

355,2655a394-042d-3e2d-a059-55ff20e721b2,SRE,2022-12-16,These rebates can help with climate-friendly upgrades around the home,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rebates-help-climate-friendly-upgrades-164654164.html,1671122814,STORY,['SRE'],"[Purchases of energy-saving home devices, such as the Google Nest Learning Thermostat, may be eligible for rebates from local utilities. (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images)As Southern California struggles to rid its skies of smog and the state aims to become carbon neutral, local government agencies and utilities are offering rebates aplenty to help residents upgrade to cleaner appliances and devices.The check writers hope to enlist you in the effort to meet federal clean-air standards and other goals by offering cash to make your home more energy efficient.Leaders of the South Coast Air Quality Management District recently said that the region won't meet air quality standards unless the federal government does a better job limiting emissions at the region's ports, airfields and rail yards. And the state's plans for carbon neutrality have their critics. Still, residents have a role to play.Most of the rebate programs require you to spend money upfront to get something back. But the state of California's GoGreen Home Energy Financing offers no-fee, no-closing-cost, low-interest loans from private lenders to help cover those initial expenses. Projects eligible for financing include upgrades to your appliances, lighting, roof, HVAC system and insulation.Here's a rundown of rebates on offer in and around Los Angeles related to home energy use. Be forewarned that the supply of cash is finite and that applications are granted on a first-come, first-served basis. Some rebate amounts may also be reduced when the supply of dollars gets low.Before you hire a contractor or buy an appliance, also check the process and requirements for obtaining a rebate. Typically, the subsidies are available only for improvements or devices that meet specific criteria, and only to the person who holds the account at that utility. As with all things in life, be sure to read the fine print first.LADWP rebatesIf you're an LADWP customer, you can seek rebates from the utility for a slew of upgrades to curb your home's appetite for power. The subsidies are available to renters as well as homeowners. Here are some of the details.Story continuesA good place to start is the DWP's marketplace, where you can buy efficient devices with rebates of up to $75 factored into the price. The marketplace also identifies rebate-eligible appliances that you can purchase from other sources. The list of available products includes refrigerators, air conditioners, light bulbs, thermostats and power strips.DWP customers enrolled in discount programs for low-income families or residents with disabilities can qualify for rebates of up to $225 on air conditioners through the utility's Cool L.A. program. The utility's website has more information on eligibility.If you choose a rebate-eligible device but don't buy it through the marketplace, you have up to 12 months from the date of purchase to apply for a rebate. You can do so at the marketplace's rebate fast track site.The marketplace also lists energy- and water-saving washing machines, which are eligible for rebates of $85 to $500 from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The amount of the rebate depends on the availability of funds and the price of the unit; to calculate how much you could qualify for, consult the MWD's rebate estimator.The DWP has several other offers that target homeowners.Cool roof: The DWP offers 20 to 60 cents per square foot in rebates for cool roof upgrades, which reflect more of the sun's energy instead of absorbing it. If it's time for you to replace your roof or its top layer, the subsidy should be enough to offset the extra cost of using cool roof materials, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates. To qualify for the rebate, you'll need to submit proof of purchase and copies of the installation contract and the approved building and safety permit.Energy Star-certified windows. The DWP offers $2 per square foot of window, skylight or door glass replaced in air-conditioned living spaces with windows that do a better job sealing out the elements. To qualify, the replacement glass must meet the DWP's standards for efficiency. In addition to proof of purchase and copies of your installation contract and approved building and safety permit, you'll need to submit the National Fenestration Rating Council label from each new window or the manufacturer's order confirmation sheet.Energy-efficient central heating and cooling system. Rebates of up to $100 per ton are available for heat pumps that meet the city's efficiency standards, and up to $120 per ton for qualified central air conditioners. To apply, you'll need to submit proof of purchase and copies of your installation contract, approved building and safety permit and Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute certificate.Whole house fan. The DWP offers a $200 rebate on fans connected to your house's frame that can move at least 1,000 cubic feet of air per minute. To apply, submit proof of purchase and copies of the installation contract and approved building and safety permit.Efficient pumps for in-ground swimming pools. Installing a qualified variable-speed or variable-flow pool pump could qualify you for a rebate of $1,000 (if it replaces a single-speed pump) or $500 (otherwise). You'll need to submit proof of purchase and installation and an approved building and safety permit (if it's a new pool) for the $500 rebate; the $1,000 rebate requires some additional paperwork.Other agency rebatesSouthern California Edison and Southern California Gas offer rebates too, covering some of the same improvements. That's because they participate in the Golden State Rebates program funded by the major state investor-owned utilities.The program provides coupons that you can redeem for discounts on products meeting the utilities' standards for efficiency, lowering the cost of those products upfront. The coupons are for the following amounts:$75 for an efficient gas-powered water heater$500 for an electric heat pump-powered water heater$40 to $75 for a thermostat$20 for a room air conditionerTo obtain coupons, go to the Golden State Rebates site and create an account, then select both the product you want to buy and the retailer where you plan to buy it.Like the DWP, Edison and SoCal Gas have online marketplaces where customers can shop for selected appliances, thermostats and other energy-efficient products. Bear in mind, though, that upgrading to more efficient gas appliances isn't going to reduce greenhouse emissions as much as switching from gas to electric.Beyond the usual fare, SoCal Gas also offers rebates of up to $70 on gas-powered clothes dryers, up to $100 on gas ranges, $300 to $500 on qualified fireplace inserts, $400 to $750 on qualified gas pool heaters, $115 to $1,000 on Energy Star-certified gas furnaces, $115 to $1,000 on gas water heaters (the higher rebates are for tankless versions), and $2,500 to $4,500 on qualified solar-powered water heaters.Not to be left out, the AQMD has its own set of rebates, including some unique ones. These include:Up to $250 to replace your gas-powered lawn mower with a new battery-powered one. Applicants need to submit proof of purchase and turn their old mower over to an approved dismantler. (A related program for commercial landscaping services is slated to begin offering rebates in March.)Vouchers worth $100 to $800 to replace wood-burning stoves with gas or electric inserts, among other options. The amount of the voucher doubles for low-income households, but the subsidies are available only in selected ZIP Codes in Boyle Heights and in or around San Bernardino, Ontario, Riverside and Norco.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

In addition, the company will establish a 2030 scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 30 percent, relative to a 2020 baseline and in accordance with guidelines from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The company's previously announced goal to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from global operations by 2050 remains unchanged.""We believe a more ambitious GHG reduction target is achievable and will create substantial value for all of our stakeholders,"" said Peter Vanacker, CEO of LyondellBasell. ""Reducing emissions while simultaneously building a world-class Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is needed to meet the demands we are seeing throughout the value chain.  This approach is not only good for society, but also good for business. We will follow a disciplined approach to prioritize high-return projects and will continue to meet our return expectations.""Estimates of the capital expenditures necessary to achieve its emissions reduction goals are built into the company's long-range plan. These investments are not expected to represent a significant portion of total capital expenditures over the next three years, nor change the capital allocation strategy. While many of the GHG emissions reduction projects are still in the early stages of development, the company will evaluate, pursue and prioritize its GHG emission investments based on each project's rate of return.LyondellBasell will submit its climate goals to SBTi to be validated against SBTi guidance. The SBTi defines and promotes best practice for corporate GHG emissions target setting aligned to the latest climate science.Story continuesIn the near term, LyondellBasell continues to execute its previously announced initiatives to reduce emissions, including:Startup of four power purchase agreements in Texas, representing approximately 400 thousand metric tons of the company's scope 2 GHG emissions annuallyPhasing out use of coal at its Wesseling, Germany site, reducing the site's scope 2 emissions by about 170 thousand metric tons annuallyAs announced in April 2022, the company is on track to close its Houston refinery by the end of December 2023.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Large-Cap Stocks With Insider Buying.Insider buying is a popular way to assess the potential of a company and can be a good indicator to gauge a stock's performance. When insiders, such as corporate officers, directors and large shareholders, buy shares of their own company, it is often seen as a sign of confidence in the future of the company. It is important to note that insider buying does not guarantee future success, but it can be a helpful indicator when researching potential investments.When looking for companies with insider buying activity, investors should focus on the size and frequency of the purchases. Insiders are required to disclose any stock purchases in regulatory filings, so investors can easily track this activity. It is important to note, however, that some insiders may be buying stock for a variety of reasons and not necessarily because they believe the stock will increase in value.Investors should also consider other factors such as the company’s fundamentals, financial health and industry trends when making investment decisions. While insider buying can be an important indicator of a company’s potential, it should not be the sole factor used when making an investment decision. Investors should also consider the company’s overall strategy and position in the market.2022 has shaken investors' confidence and proven to be a difficult year for equities. As of December 14, the S&amp;P 500 has lost over 15% year to date, the Nasdaq is down 28.5% for the year, and the Dow has shed 6% since the beginning of 2022.

However, there are periods in the market where commodity-based businesses outperform the broad indexes by a wide margin. Therefore, to have balance in the portfolio, we have long searched for a competitively advantaged company in the commodity space. We believe that Texas Pacific Land Corporation(NYSE:TPL), meets that criterion. Formed out of assets of formerly bankrupt railroads, TPL controls the largest acreage of land in the Permian basin – the center of the US shale oil industry. The company has two main sources of income: 1) royalties from oil &amp; gas extracted on its properties – essentially a free call option on future oil prices and production; and 2) a water business which develops water resources and sells services to the fracking industry. We see TPL as an effective way to diversify the portfolio into a commodity exposed business that has a history of smart capital allocation and low risk of financial distress during periods of low oil prices. The company has no debt, and $281 million in cash. The company uses most of its cash flows to pay dividends and repurchase shares.”13.

The competitive environment appears to have increased more quickly than management has anticipated. We believe it is prudent to sell the entire position, as Ball is forced to reevaluate its growth strategy and shift its capital deployments.

After accounting for the recent loss, the US$5.5m worth of shares they purchased is now worth US$5.8m, suggesting a good return on their investment.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At General ElectricIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at around the current price of US$78.81. Of course they may have changed their mind. But this suggests they are optimistic. If someone buys shares at well below current prices, it's a good sign on balance, but keep in mind they may no longer see value. In this case we're pleased to report that the insider purchases were made at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 73.54k shares for US$5.5m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by General Electric insiders. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeGeneral Electric is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Does General Electric Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. General Electric insiders own about US$211m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At General Electric Tell Us?The fact that there have been no General Electric insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like General Electric insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in General Electric, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Given that a company's profit can increase or decrease depending on various factors, a company's dividend can also increase or decrease.2022 has been a challenging year for many companies given the higher inflation and the rising interest rates. As a result, many stocks have not done well this year and the market as a whole has declined. In terms of the three major indexes, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 16.2% year to date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 6.77%, and the NASDAQ has retreated 28.9% in 2022 as of December 13.While the market hasn't done well, a percentage of the leading dividend stocks have outperformed the market this year. Some leading dividend stocks have outperformed because their businesses have pricing power and competitive advantages that make them relatively resistant to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. Other leading dividend stocks have rallied given investors expect their earnings per share to grow substantially in the future.Of the leading dividend stocks that have outperformed this year, many have increased their annual dividends to return even more capital back to shareholders.2023While November's core inflation data was lower than expected, many analysts still think the Federal Reserve will still raise interest rates further and that there is still a likely probability of a recession in 2023. According to a monthly survey of around 300 institutional investors who represent trillions in funds, for instance, 82% thought recession was the 'most likely' scenario in the coming months.Story continuesGiven the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of many stocks across many different sectors.Photo by Roberto Júnior on UnsplashMethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 2022, we picked 12 stocks with competitive advantages that outperformed the S&amp;P 500's performance in 2022 that also had a dividend yield of over 1% as of December 13.We then ranked the dividend stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares in the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Stocks That Outperformed in 202212.

(NYSE:QSR), the owner of Burger King, has outperformed the market given its year to date rally of 11.84% and its dividend yield of 3.21%.Although inflation has been a headwind for many companies this year, the higher prices have not affected Restaurant Brands International Inc.

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 10.68%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 4.38%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a tech stock that has outperformed both the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ, which are down 16.2% and 28.9% in 2022, respectively.

Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 11.28%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 0.95%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) is a leading railroad whose stock has rallied 11.28% this year given increasing demand. For Q3 2022, Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)'s core adjusted diluted EPS rose 15% year over year to C$1.01 while total revenues increased 19% year over year to C$2.312 billion. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) also has a dividend yield of 0.95% as of 12/13.Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman commented on Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) in an investor letter,CP is a high-quality, inflation-protected business led by a best-in-class management team that operates in an oligopolistic industry with significant barriers to entry. With an improving volume and pricing outlook combined with the upcoming transformational acquisition of Kansas City Southern (“KCS”), we believe that CP’s prospects are bright. CP reported revenue growth of 7% in the second quarter as pricing and mix, fuel surcharge pass-throughs and foreign exchange more than offset a small decline in volumes. CP is leveraging the strong pricing environment to renew contracts at an average price increase of over 6%. Pricing directly benefits earnings as rails pass on increases in fuel and other expenses to customers through contractual fuel surcharges and CPI escalators. In addition to earnings growth, high inflation should help rail transportation take share from trucking and lead to incremental volume growth over time. Customers are choosing cheaper transportation solutions as prices rise, and CP’s mission-critical rail service is often the cheapest or only viable method for transporting heavy freight over long distances. High fuel prices and wage gains also disproportionally increase the cost of trucking, which is up to three times less fuel efficient and much more labor intensive than rail transportation.8.

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Year to Date Return as of December 13: 36.33%Dividend Yield as of December 13: 1.32%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the better performing dividend stocks in 2022 given its surge of 36.33% year to date.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Procter &amp; Gamble is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$19b ÷ (US$116b - US$37b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 23%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 14%. View our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceIn the above chart we have measured Procter &amp; Gamble's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Procter &amp; Gamble.How Are Returns Trending?Procter &amp; Gamble is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 48% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesIn Conclusion...To bring it all together, Procter &amp; Gamble has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a solid 91% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Procter &amp; Gamble, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Also, high acquisition expenses do not bode well for its margin expansion.However, Adobe is benefiting from strong demand for its creative products. The company’s Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud products are driving the top-line growth. Further, rising subscription revenues and solid momentum across the mobile apps are major positives.

379,1ec3dbbc-552e-3914-8550-635ed19763d3,UDR,2022-12-16,Analysts Just Upgraded These 3 REITs,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-just-upgraded-3-reits-161831912.html,1671121111,STORY,"['MAA-PI', 'PEAK', 'UDR']","[Many real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks that were trounced throughout much of 2022 have shown much-improved price performance over the past two months. But analysts have been slow to upgrade the sector, citing ongoing interest-rate hikes and fears of a recession in 2023.That may be changing, especially if the Federal Reserve begins to taper down on its rate hikes as Chairman Jerome Powell indicated could happen. Take a look at three REITs that have seen analyst upgrades within the past few weeks:Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is a Germantown, Tennessee-based residential REIT whose specialty is purchasing and leasing apartment complexes. Mid-America Apartment Communities owns over 101,000 units in 296 communities across 16 states and Washington, D.C. Most of Mid-America Apartment Communities’ properties are located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic states.This past week, Goldman Sachs analyst Chandni Luthra upgraded Mid-America Apartment Communities from Neutral to Buy, while raising her previous price target from $178 to $194.Mid-America Apartment Communities has an annual dividend of $5, which yields 3%. The 52-week range is $141.13 to $231.63, and the most recent closing price was $163.62. This represents a potential upside of 19.2% to the analyst’s new target price.UDR Inc. (NYSE: UDR) is another residential REIT that owns, leases and manages 58,464 apartment units across 13 states plus Washington, D.C. UDR, formerly known as United Dominion Realty Trust, is based in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, and has been in business for over 50 years. It was added to the S&amp;P 500 in 2016.At the beginning of December, analyst Adam Kramer of Morgan Stanley upgraded UDR from Equal-Weight to Overweight. At the same time he chose to lower his price target from $49 to $47.UDR has an annual dividend of $1.52, which yields 3.7%. The 52-week price range is $37.18 to $61.06. Its most recent closing price was $40.30, and that represents 17% of potential upside from here.Story continuesHealthpeak Properties Inc. (NYSE: PEAK) is a Denver-based healthcare REIT that owns and operates private-pay facilities such as life science centers, medical offices and senior housing. The company was added to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008.Healthpeak Properties owns 464 properties in Colorado, Tennessee and California valued at more than $20 billion. Its diversification of property types helps Healthpeak reduce the risks of a recession. Many of Healthpeak Properties’ life science tenants are large, well-known pharmaceuticals, such as Amgen Inc, Pfizer Inc and Bristol Myers Squibb Co.Analyst Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI Group recently upgraded Healthpeak Properties from In-Line to Outperform, simultaneously initiating a $28 price target.Healthpeak Properties has an annual dividend of $1.20 yielding 4.7%. The 52-week price range for Healthpeak Properties is $21.41 to $36.85. From its most recent closing price of $25.30, that represents a potential upside of 10%.Although analyst upgrades can propel stocks higher, investors should keep in mind that analysts are not always right. Many of them have at best a 50% overall success rate. Investors are urged to always do their own due diligence before purchasing any stock.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

Starting in March, passengers will have to earn 40,000 of the carrier’s “Loyalty Points” to achieve gold status. Previously, that threshold was set at 30,000.Gold flyers are the bottom rung of the American Airlines frequent flyer ladder and are eligible for free upgrades, when seats are available.The airline is introducing a new introductory reward level, which will give people who collect 15,000 Loyalty Points Group 5 boarding and the option for one of two other rewards: Priority check-in and security lines privileges (along with an earlier boarding group on one trip) or five coupons for a preferred location seat, which tend to be closer to the front of the plane.It’s going to be harder to collect those Loyalty Points for frugal travelers, too. American said people who buy a Basic Economy ticket will get two miles per dollar spent, compared to five currently.Say goodbye, meanwhile, to MileSAAver and AAnytime awards, which let passengers redeem frequent flyer miles for tickets at minimum rates. Instead, American plans to offer Web specials, with alternating demand-based miles requirements.The changes come as passengers return to the skies in bulk and airlines deal with higher costs as the economy continues to run hot. American’s not the only one adjusting its loyalty program.Delta Air Lines, in October, announced that in order to be eligible for its top-tier status levels, passengers will need to spend roughly 33% more with the carrier each year.

American was the first U.S. carrier to pioneer SMS in 2009. It has since been incorporated into Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations for all carriers.Our SMS emphasizes safety management as a fundamental business process across the enterprise. It involves a full commitment from the most senior leaders through to each team member to integrate safety into how we do our jobs. Our SMS promotes a culture in which our team members proactively identify, analyze and mitigate risks. The SMS ensures robust and repeatable processes with local ownership, driven by data to reduce risks and continuously improve and enhance safety. We collaborate closely with the FAA to maintain operational safety at the highest level possible and actively share best practices with our industry peers, governments and aerospace manufacturers. The four components of our SMS are noted in the accompanying box.Safety PolicyOur corporate Safety Policy applies to all team members, business partners, contractors and consultants. It sets American's safety objectives and standards and assigns responsibilities for safety across our organization. The policy also conveys management's commitment to safety performance and to improving the level of safety through measurable goals and key performance indicators. Part of our SMS foundation, this policy helps to create a culture that encourages effective management of risk along with continuous improvement. The Safety Policy complies with all applicable regulatory requirements and laws in the countries where we operate and establishes standards for acceptable operational behaviors.Our Emergency Response Manual (ERM), which establishes effective and efficient response practices for various types of emergencies, is an integral part of our SMS. The ERM serves as the governing document for the American Airlines Corporate Emergency Response Plan. It includes guidelines to prepare for and respond to emergencies, responsibilities for team members, protocols for communicating with internal and external stakeholders and mechanisms to report emergencies. The ERM also includes a detailed Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan that helped us navigate through every phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.Story continuesSafety AssuranceThe Safety Assurance component of our SMS stipulates how we use data and conduct quality assurance and internal oversight to validate the effectiveness of risk controls and the performance of the SMS. Composed of several individual programs and initiatives, Safety Assurance verifies that risk controls in our operational processes continue to conform to requirements and remain effective in maintaining risks at acceptable levels.Safety ReportingOur senior leadership team, which includes our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, receives monthly updates on team member safety and risks across our system. We focus on injury reduction, evaluate trends and develop programs to enhance safety. We are centralizing our data collection and injury reporting tools to provide better visibility, simplicity and easy access for company leaders. In addition to monitoring injury rates, we closely track aircraft ground damage, both as a part of our safety culture and because it is correlated with on-the-job injuries.After a significant decline from 2019 to 2020, team member injury rates in our mainline and regional operations rose along with the increase in our operations in 2021. The challenges associated with ramping up our operations as demand returned and introducing new and returning team members back into our operations contributed to this increase. We remain focused on reducing injuries and redoubling our efforts to enhance our health and safety policies and procedures and elevate our safety culture. In 2021, we also experienced an increase in accidents in our mainline operations; five of the six recorded accidents were due to turbulence that caused crewmember injuries. As a result, we are implementing new technologies that pilots can use while en route to identify upcoming turbulence, updating flight attendant procedures for anticipated and forecasted turbulence, and expanding our use of data analysis by our Turbulence Task Force.The overall goal of team member reporting is to improve safety awareness and identify operational deficiencies by facilitating an open line of communication between the employees and management without fear of reprisal. Potential safety concerns and suggestions identified through our many safety reporting programs are critical to early identification of hazards. These reports also allow the company to proactively address potential risks and implement corrective actions to resolve safety and security issues.When a team member identifies any safety-related concern, he or she is encouraged to report the issue. Once the concern is received, skilled safety investigators collaborate with operational partners to review the information provided, assess the hazard and develop corrective actions to ensure the issue is addressed. These reports are then reviewed as part of the broader SMS to determine if there are system related risks developing. We follow up with the reporter to communicate what we learned and what steps we are taking to prevent similar concerns from arising again. This followthrough and prompt action helps encourage additional reporting, thus creating a robust safety reporting life cycle.Our most prominent safety reporting initiatives include the following: Aviation Safety Action Programs, Ground Safety Action Programs, Flight Operations Quality Assurance, the International Air Transport Association's Operational Safety Audit, Line Operations Safety Audits, and the Learning and Improvement Team.Safety Action ProgramsEveryone at American has a role to perform in ensuring that our people, customers and assets remain safe. Through Aviation Safety Action Programs (ASAPs) and Ground Safety Action Programs (GSAPs), team members can openly report potential hazards without concern of fault, thus improving our operations along the way.American was the first airline to create an ASAP, although such programs are now commonplace among airlines worldwide. Currently, we have ASAPs for our Flight, Flight Service, Dispatch, Technical Operations and Central Load Planning teams, giving us significantly greater coverage than the industry average. In 2021, we recorded 10,847 ASAP reports. We expect to roll out programs in 2022 for Gate Agent and Crew Scheduling teams, which will give us ASAP coverage across 100% of our operations.Our GSAP for Fleet Service and Cargo teams plays the same role, encouraging team members to report potential safety issues in cargo and catering environments, control centers and on the ramp. This program was created in collaboration with the Transport Workers Union of America-International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers and the FAA. In 2021, we recorded 487 GSAP reports.Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA)FOQA is a voluntary safety program administered jointly by American and the Allied Pilots Association (APA) that uses routinely recorded flight data to proactively identify and correct deficiencies in flight operations. We routinely monitor approximately 90% of our flights and use algorithms to look for potential safety risks. The results help us better understand pilot performance and the operating environment. They also allow us to monitor aircraft systems, performance and operational efficiency.To enhance FOQA's effectiveness, American partnered with Collins Aerospace in 2021 to retrofit our narrowbody aircraft with its Aircraft Interface Device (AID). The entire fleet at American will be equipped with this wireless data transfer system by the end of 2024. AID improves the speed with which we can retrieve FOQA data, and it represents an important step toward increasing accuracy in monthly reporting, improving aircraft reliability and preparing for future products and capabilities.American will also be the first carrier in the United States to adopt CEFA Aviation Mobile Services, a cloud-based application that allows pilots to recreate their flights on their company iPad. This tool will improve on the concept of crew debriefing by providing real-time feedback to our pilots. It turns each flight into a learning opportunity, ultimately contributing to the safety assurance of our SMS.International Air Transport Association's Operational Safety Audit (IOSA)As part of our commitment to transparency and monitoring, we are a registered participant in the IOSA program, which is an internationally recognized evaluation system designed to assess an airline's operational management and control systems. An IOSA, which takes place every two years, creates a structured methodology with standardized checklists that are comparable on a worldwide basis, enabling and maximizing the joint use of audit reports. In April 2022, we successfully completed our IOSA audit in conformance with all standards and recommended practices. As a result, American Airlines IOSA registration has been renewed until July 2024.Line Operations Safety Audits (LOSA)Since launching our continuous pilot LOSA program in 2017, we have been sending highly trained pilot observers onto the flight deck to better understand work-as-done versus work-as-imagined. Observing our frontline team members in action and gathering safety-related data on environmental conditions, operational complexities and crew performance in real time provides us with valuable insights for enhancing safety and resilience.We are expanding LOSA to other work groups outside our pilot group. In 2021, we implemented a continuous Dispatch LOSA and are collecting data to enhance safety performance. We also are developing a Cabin LOSA program and expect to start conducting observations in 2023. The Cabin LOSA program will help us better understand the challenges facing our flight attendants and the measures we can take to keep the cabin safe for everyone. We will continue to evaluate the feasibility of expanding LOSA to other operational groups, with 100% coverage as our ultimate goal.""The Learning and Improvement Team is the latest addition to our Flight SMS programs. By focusing on what we do well, it complements the programs that concentrate primarily on areas where we need to improve.""- Bobbi WellsVice President, Safety Systems, Efficiency and ComplianceLearning and Improvement Team (LIT)We created LIT in 2022 to collect and analyze data on what makes our pilots successful in their everyday work. LIT is composed of line pilots who are specially trained in flight deck observations and facilitated discussions. While it is similar in some ways to LOSA, LIT is a separate program. One of the key differences between LIT and American's other Flight SMS programs (i.e., ASAP, FOQA, LOSA) is that LIT focuses on what goes well and why, thus providing a new safety lens through which to view the operation. Combining LIT data with other SMS data provides American with a broader picture of the system, rather than looking solely at unwanted outcomes.Efficiency and Continuous Improvement TeamLearning and continuous improvement are essential to a robust safety program. This new team at American will solicit input and suggestions from frontline operational employees on how to improve the efficiency of the operation without compromising safety. Deferring to the expertise and input from these employees, all ideas and suggestions will be reviewed and vetted through our formalized SMS process. Employees may submit feedback and suggestions through their safety reporting programs, directly by email or by scanning the QR code on a card that is handed out during efficiency and safety meetings and posted in select locations.Safety Risk ManagementThe Safety Risk Management (SRM) element of our SMS provides a decision-making process for identifying hazards and mitigating risk based on a thorough understanding of our systems and their operating environment. SRM enables us to consider the risks in our operations and reduce them to an acceptable level. We use the SRM process whenever there is a significant change to our operations, such as delivery of a new type of aircraft or the addition of a new airport to our network. We also apply SRM when our Safety Assurance process identifies a new hazard or an ineffective control of an existing hazard.We use several tools to identify hazards and evaluate the need for new or revised risk controls. The process of risk management is the same regardless of the trigger or event, and our SMS looks at multiple factors for risk. While the FAA requirements are geared toward flight safety, our SMS goes further to evaluate a wider range of global risks, including operational disruptions.Safety PromotionSafety culture is the foundation of any SMS, with trust at the core. At American we believe in a Just Culture approach, which encourages each team member to take responsibility and have accountability for achieving the highest safety standards and results. This approach, which we have championed for more than a decade and has since become an accepted aviation industry standard, encourages team members to report errors, risky decisions or omissions without fear of punitive actions. We train our teams to look at potential safety events using three types of behaviors: human errors, at-risk behavior and reckless behavior.Safety TrainingOur ramp agents have the highest rate of injuries among all team member groups, primarily as the result of lifting baggage, often in awkward and tight spaces. Working with Pristine Condition International, which introduced the science of Olympic weightlifting techniques to industry, we recently conducted a training program on proper lifting techniques. This initiative included bringing athletic trainers to our busiest airport hubs to work with ramp agents on body mechanics and fitness. Our flight attendant group has the second-highest rate of injuries, followed by aircraft mechanics, and we have initiatives underway to reduce these rates as well. For example, we produced three new seatbelt safety videos for team members based on actual incidents.Turbulence Task ForceIn 2021, our Turbulence Task Force completed serving its original charter to reduce flight attendant and passenger injuries during flight, and now the identified hazards and concerns are addressed in our established and approved SMS process. The program proved highly successful.StaySafe and Safety Engagement ToolStaySafe is a safety communications campaign implemented across our airport and technical operations organizations. Its materials focus on lessons learned and ways to prevent team member injuries and equipment damage. Any bulletins or alerts are available across multiple platforms in order to reach all team members.Through our new Safety Engagement Tool, we are bringing company leadership to the frontlines to engage in conversations with team members. Managers can communicate safety expectations, assess risks in the operation and reinforce safe behaviors.Read moreAmerican Airlines, Thursday, December 15, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from American Airlines on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: American AirlinesWebsite: profiles/american-airlinesEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: American AirlinesView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732017/American-Airlines-Safety-Management-System]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Eaton (NYSE:ETN) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Eaton is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.8b ÷ (US$34b - US$6.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Eaton has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 10%. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Eaton compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Eaton here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Eaton Tell Us?Over the past five years, Eaton's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. Businesses with these traits tend to be mature and steady operations because they're past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Eaton doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Eaton has been paying out a decent 43% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn a nutshell, Eaton has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 131% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Eaton  that we think you should be aware of.While Eaton isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sherwin-Williams:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$2.8b ÷ (US$22b - US$6.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 17%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Chemicals industry average of 12% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sherwin-Williams compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Sherwin-Williams.What Can We Tell From Sherwin-Williams' ROCE Trend?Sherwin-Williams has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 62% in that same time. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesIn Conclusion...In summary, we're delighted to see that Sherwin-Williams has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 89% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Sherwin-Williams  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, PepsiCo has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on PepsiCo will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For PepsiCo?PepsiCo's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 19% gain to the company's bottom line. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year EPS frustratingly shrank by 21% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 5.2% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 9.2% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's alarming that PepsiCo's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.We've established that PepsiCo currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.And what about other risks?

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, sold US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$731. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 26% of Arthur Ryan's holding.Insiders in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, currently worth about US$3.3b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Regeneron Pharmaceuticals shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion, recommending the approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat adults and adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). This positive opinion covers those who are 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg, and inadequately controlled by, are intolerant to or who are not candidates for conventional medicinal therapy. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months. In May 2022, Dupixent 300 mg weekly was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg.EoE is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. The results seen with Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation underlying this disease. For people with EoE, swallowing even small amounts of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. They are often left to contend with the frustration and anxiety of a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid, a poor quality of life and a higher risk of depression. In cases where EoE causes the esophagus to narrow, forced and potentially painful dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed. In severe cases, a feeding tube may be the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition.Story continuesThe positive CHMP opinion is supported by 52-week data from a Phase 3 trial consisting of three parts – Part A and Part B investigated Dupixent 300 mg weekly compared to placebo for 24 weeks, and Part C observed patients from Parts A and B, all of whom were on Dupixent, having continued on or switched to Dupixent for an additional 28 weeks. The results demonstrated Dupixent-treated patients experienced improvements in their ability to swallow as early as four weeks, as well as histological disease remission, improvements in abnormal endoscopic findings of the esophagus and cellular improvements at 24 weeks compared to placebo, with outcomes maintained up to one year. The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included infections.The use of Dupixent in adults and adolescents with EoE is investigational in the EU and is not yet approved.About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and prurigo nodularis, as well as investigational diseases such as EoE in the EU.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in Europe, the U.S. and Japan. More than 500,000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab), Dupixent, Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc), Praluent® (alirocumab), Kevzara® (sarilumab), Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab, maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date, dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications, Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials, including pediatric EoE, hand and foot atopic dermatitis, chronic inducible urticaria-cold, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic pruritus of unknown origin, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation, chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation, and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical), or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 months of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older, who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg), with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with eosinophilic esophagitis under 12 years of age and who weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg).to treat adults with prurigo nodularis (PN).

The FDA approved Dupixent for the same indication in September 2022.The nod in Europe was based on data from two phase III studies, PRIME and PRIME2, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in adults with prurigo nodularis. Data from the studies showed that patients treated with Dupixent experienced a higher clinically meaningful reduction in itch at 12 weeks compared to placebo.The approval in Europe was expected as last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency rendered a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent for the prurigo nodularis indication.Dupixent has been granted an additional one-year marketing protection in the EU, based on the recommendation by the CHMP.In Europe, Dupixent is presently approved to treat atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), as well as investigational disease eosinophilic esophagitis. Purigo nodularis is now the fourth disease for which Dupixent is approved in Europe.Dupixent is approved in the United States for five indications — severe CRSwNP, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis.The Sanofi stock has lost 4.3% so far this year against the industry’s growth of 12.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Please note that Dupixent is being jointly marketed by REGN and SNY under a global collaboration agreement. Sanofi records global net product sales of Dupixent, while Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with the global sales of the drug.Story continuesDupixent’s frequent label expansion approvals are driving its sales. The drug generated sales worth €5.89 billion in the first nine months of 2022, reflecting an increase of 44.5% at CER year over year.Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying dupilumab in late-stage studies for a broad range of diseases, driven by type II inflammation like pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, urticaria and bullous pemphigoid.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderSanofi currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.38bUS$6.67bUS$7.14bUS$7.18bUS$7.26bUS$7.35bUS$7.46bUS$7.59bUS$7.72bUS$7.86bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 1.03%Est @ 1.31%Est @ 1.51%Est @ 1.65%Est @ 1.75%Est @ 1.82% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$5.9kUS$5.7kUS$5.7kUS$5.3kUS$5.0kUS$4.7kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$135bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$135b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$63bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$111b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$212, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.066. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?

This year, Union Pacific committed to the SBTi to revalidate its short-term target in line with the 1.5°C global warming scenario and develop a long-term, science-based target to reach net-zero value chain GHG emissions by 2050. Both targets will be published after they are validated by SBTi.As part of these commitments, the railroad signed the largest locomotive modernization deal in rail history earlier this year for 600 locomotive modernizations, totaling more than $1 billion. The modernizations will provide approximately 350 tons of carbon reduction per locomotive per year, the equivalent of removing emissions from nearly 45,000 passenger cars.Union Pacific emerged as a leader among transportation companies that participate in the CSA reporting and evaluation process in 2022 and was one of five transportation companies included in the Dow Jones North America Sustainability Index.Story continuesAdditional highlights of Union Pacific's sustainability efforts include:Reduced fuel consumption by more than 11 million gallons in 2021 compared to 2020.Increased use of renewable fuel and biodiesels.Plans to purchase North America's largest carrier-owned fleet of battery-electric locomotives.The first U.S. railroad to formally support the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), reinforcing company's commitment to transparent disclosure.More information about Union Pacific's sustainability efforts are available at up.com.ABOUT UNION PACIFICUnion Pacific (NYSE: UNP) delivers the goods families and businesses use every day with safe, reliable and efficient service.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 25% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 20% in the last year.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Cisco Systems In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Cisco Systems achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.6% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 5% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Cisco Systems' TSR for the last 5 years was 45%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 18% received by Cisco Systems shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 8%, each year, over five years. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity.
