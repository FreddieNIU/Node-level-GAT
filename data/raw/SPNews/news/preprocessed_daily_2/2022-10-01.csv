This was driven by the adoption of intelligent power and sensing solutions in the markets like automotive due to the electric vehicle (EV) megatrend.Due to rising inflation, industrial and residential buildings will be looking for lighting solutions that provide high efficiency with higher power savings to lower operations cost. Launching its latest lighting solutions will aid onsemi in attracting new clients from industrial and aid in its top-line growth.ON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation Price and ConsensusON Semiconductor Corporation price-consensus-chart | ON Semiconductor Corporation Quoteonsemi Investing in Industrial Sensing to Boost Share PriceON's shares, which currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have fallen 7.3% in the year-to-date period, narrower than the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry’s and Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 24% and 33.8%, respectively. The entire Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is reeling under various operational challenges due to the macro-economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.onsemi has been able to beat the cyclical downtrend by investing in strategic areas like intelligent power and sensing, which helps it to grow its gross and operating margin.The launch of onsemi’s latest lighting solutions comes right after the company approved an exit plan to close one of its divisions in the advanced solutions group segment to further enable the company to direct its investments to high-growth margin business segments.Story continuesIn the second quarter of 2022, advanced solutions group or ASG revenues of $716.7 million (34.4% of revenues) increased 4% on a year-over-year basis.onsemi is also expanding its silicon carbide (SiC) facility in Hudson, NH. The new hub will increase ON’s SiC boule production capacity by five times year over year and address certain supply-chain bottlenecks. Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Further, positively impacting onsemi’s decision to expand operations in high-growth markets is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China. Onsemi peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances.  Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight. This helps STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.However, onsemi expects demand to continue outpacing supply throughout 2022. With the recent focus on high-growth margin business segments, onsemi can address the rising supply-chain issues, distinguishing its services from its competitors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AYI is slated to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Oct 4, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings and sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.1% and 6.4%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines increased by 27.1% and 17.9%, respectively.Acuity Brands beat earnings expectations in the trailing nine quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has decreased to $3.35 from $3.40 over the past 60 days.

It has been introducing new lighting and controls products and evolving certain parts of the product and solutions portfolio. These products use fewer inputs and are highly mobile. Some of the products are globally sourced, while others are manufactured in the company’s facilities to mitigate the supply-chain complexity, thereby helping in improving margins.The company has been investing in prioritizing deliveries for customers when others have been unable to. It has been focusing on certain areas to create compelling new products that are both innovative and market-moving. These moves are likely to have contributed to fiscal fourth-quarter revenues.Segment-wise, it remains optimistic about the ABL business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABL segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,070 million, up from $1,061 million in the fiscal third quarter.Despite higher raw materials and freight costs, along with supply-chain interruptions for electrical components, Acuity Brands’ fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings are likely to have registered a year-over-year growth, given effective cost management and price increase across the portfolio.The company has been banking on its strength in go-to-market channels and product portfolio. Its focus on service and product vitality and inorganic moves also bode well. The acquisition of a developer and manufacturer of lighting components — OSRAM’s North American Digital Systems business in July 2021 — is expected to have contributed to its top line.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AYI this time around.

PBF, Unum Group UNM, HF Sinclair DINO and TravelCenters of America TA.4 Stocks Trading Near 52-Week Highs That Can Climb FurtherStocks hitting their 52-week high and delivering consistent performance in the past few quarters offer attractive opportunities to investors while building a portfolio. This is because stocks near that level are perceived to be winners. However, stocks touching a new 52-week high are often predisposed to profit-taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.Moreover, given the high price, investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced. While the speculations are not baseless, all stocks hitting a 52-week high are not necessarily overpriced.In fact, investors might lose out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices.Stocks such as PBF Energy Inc., Unum Group, HF Sinclair and TravelCenters of America are expected to maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs.  More information on a stock is necessary to understand whether or not there is scope for further upside.Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks. The strategy borrows from the basics of momentum investing. This technique bets on ""buy high, sell higher.""52-Week High: A Good IndicatorMany a time, stocks hitting a 52-week high fail to scale higher despite having potential. This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and expect the price to crash.In fact, overvaluation is natural for most of these stocks as investors' focus (or willingness to pay a premium) has helped them reach the level. But that does not always indicate an impending decline. Factors such as robust sales, surging profit levels, earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative. In other words, the momentum might continue.Story continuesAlso, when a string of positive developments dominates the market, investors find their under-reaction unwarranted, even if there are no company-specific driving forces.Here are our four picks of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:PBF Energy is a leading refiner of crude.

Unum's conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.36. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.09. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.36 and as low as 4.48, with a median of 5.97, all within the past year.We should also highlight that UNM has a P/B ratio of 0.81. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. UNM's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.22. UNM's P/B has been as high as 0.85 and as low as 0.41, with a median of 0.57, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.65. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.56.Story continuesFinally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.81. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.14. UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.75, all within the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Unum Group is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And, while CFI may need more evidence to prove its case on remand, “at this juncture, we cannot say that (its allegation) is implausible,” Senior Appeals Judge Phyllis Thompson wrote for the panel.Walmart spokeswoman Abby Williams-Bailey said the company disagreed with the Court of Appeals. “We are continuing to review the Court’s decision and weighing our options for further appellate review,” she said in an email.CVS and its attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.CFI Legal Director Nick Little, who argued the consolidated appeals, hailed Thursday’s decision while recognizing that the case is a long way from over.“The D.C. Court of Appeals has given us the chance to prove that what the retailers have done is fraudulent, and now it's our job to prove it to a jury,” he said.Even so, Thursday’s decision “put retailers of drugs across the country in notice that they can be held responsible for the message they send by how they sign and display fake alternative medicine,” Little added in an email. “Our goal is to ensure that all retailers stop this misrepresentation.”Story continuesThursday’s decision also establishes that CFI has standing to sue under D.C.’s law, which expressly authorizes suit by a “nonprofit organization … organized and operating, in whole or in part, for the purpose of promoting interests or rights of consumers.”The lower courts found CFI did not meet that description, since it was suing on behalf of the “general population” in order to “foster a society free of … pseudoscience.”The Court of Appeals, however, said the two goals were not inconsistent, and that CFI “at least in part, is both organized and operates to promote the interests of those who would be consumers of ‘ineffective’ homeopathic products.”The consolidated cases are Center for Inquiry Inc. v. Walmart Inc. and CVS Pharmacy Inc., D.C. Court of Appeals, Nos. 20-CV-392 and 20-CV-530.For Center for Inquiry: Nicholas Little of CFIFor Walmart: Christina Sarchio of Dechert; Matthew Kirtland, Jeffrey Margulies, and Katherine Connolly of Norton Rose FulbrightFor CVS Pharmacy: Jeanne Gills and Lauren Champaign of Foley &amp; Lardner]"

The company's exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditures remain a headwind for the company.However, Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the company's financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity.

RJF and Evercore Inc. EVR.Industry: Investment BankingLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1986357/3-investment-banks-to-watch-amid-industry-wide-headwindsThe Zacks Investment Bank industry, which had been having a dream run since mid-2020, is now facing a challenging operating backdrop due to serious macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. This, along with costs related to technological upgrades and business diversification efforts, will hurt the industry players' financials.Yet, the trading business, which had been normalizing after a robust performance during the pandemic era, is again witnessing improved performance on heightened market volatility and client activity. Hence, industry players like Morgan Stanley, Raymond James Financial, Inc. and Evercore Inc. are worth a look despite near-term headwinds.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Investment Bank industry consists of firms that provide financial products and services that include advisory-based financial transactions to corporations, governments and financial institutions across the globe. These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary market offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As).Gradually the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management. Therefore, the industry players work mainly through three product segments — investment banking (comprising M&amp;As, advisory services and securities underwriting), asset management and trading and principal investments (consisting of proprietary and brokerage trading).3 Major Trends Shaping the Future of Investment Bank IndustrySlowdown in Underwriting and M&amp;As: After a blockbuster performance in 2021, IPO, underwriting (mainly equity) and deal-making activities have almost come to a grinding halt since the beginning of this year. The primary reasons for the shrinking investment banking (IB) activities are the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict and significant monetary tightening across the globe to control raging inflation.Story continuesThese challenging market conditions are leading to a plunge in stock prices and slowing global economic growth, thereby hurting debt and equity issuances. While the deal pipeline looks healthy, there has been a substantial decline in M&amp;A activity and volumes. Thus, subdued underwriting and advisory businesses are expected to hurt industry players' revenue growth.Technological Upgrades Lead to Higher Costs: Innovative trading platforms and investments in technology and advertising are likely to support the overall operations of investment banks. The industry players are emphasizing attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending on technology to support clients with infrastructure development and new platforms. Given these efforts, investment banks are likely to face increasing technology-related costs, thereby hurting the bottom-line growth.Trading Business to Offer Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. From the beginning of second-quarter 2021, markets began to normalize and equity markets were less volatile following the extreme volatility recorded in 2020 and the first couple of months of 2021 due to the coronavirus outbreak-induced uncertainty. Then again, since the beginning of this year, market volatility has significantly increased on several geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns. This has helped trading volumes, which along with substantial cash in the hands of investors, might boost trading income.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Grim PictureThe Zacks Investment Bank industry is a 17-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #166, which places it in the bottom 34% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a disappointing earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Over the past year, the industry's earnings estimates for the current year have moved 5.9% lower.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider despite industry-wide challenges, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Investment Bank industry has underperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. While the stocks in the industry have collectively lost 17.6%, the S&amp;P 500 composite has declined 16.4% and the Zacks Finance sector fell 17.3%.Industry ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry's relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing investment banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 3.12X, above the median level of 2.62X, over the past five years. This compares with the highest level of 3.85X and the lowest level of 1.35X over this period. However, the industry is trading at a huge discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 9.36X and the median level is 9.79X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing investment banks with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group's P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector's trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio of 4.06X and the median level of 3.85X for the same period are above the Zacks Investment Bank industry's respective ratios.3 Investment Banks to Keep an Eye OnMorgan Stanley: This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is one of the leading global players in the IB business. The company has offices across 41 countries through which it offers services to corporations, governments, financial institutions and individuals.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Morgan Stanley's initiatives to restructure operations and more focus on Wealth Management and Investment Management segments (as these are less dependent on the capital markets) are bearing fruits. The company's strategic expansion efforts, including the buyouts of Eaton Vance, E*Trade Financial and Shareworks, are steps in this direction. Thus, both segments' aggregate contribution to net revenues jumped from 26% in 2010 to 50% in 2021.While near-term concerns will likely hamper financials in the next few quarters, Morgan Stanley's solid balance sheet, manageable debt level and investment-grade long-term credit ratings are major tailwinds.MS has a market cap of $136.5 billion. Over the past 12 months, shares of the company have declined 16.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has remained unchanged at $6.69 over the past 30 days.Raymond James: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is a diversified company based in St. Petersburg, FL. The company, along with its subsidiaries, provides financial services mainly in the United States, Canada and the U.K.RJF has accomplished several strategic deals over the past years, which has also helped its expansion into Europe and Canada. In July 2022, it acquired SumRidge Partners, which will boost its fixed income capabilities. In June, it concluded the acquisition of TriState, while in January, it closed the acquisition of U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group PLC. These deals, along with several past ones, poise Raymond James well for growth.Though steadily rising expenses and current geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties make us apprehensive, a strong balance sheet and investment-grade long-term credit ratings from leading credit rating agencies are likely to continue supporting growth. Also, Raymond James' robust capital deployments reflect a solid liquidity position and will keep enhancing shareholder value.With a market cap of $21.6 billion, Raymond James is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Its shares have rallied 9.4% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings has remained unchanged at $9.61 over the past 30 days.Evercore: This Zacks Rank #3 company is a premier global independent IB advisory firm. It also offers wealth management services. It operates from its offices and affiliates in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.EVR generates the majority of revenues from the IB business. Efforts to boost its client base in advisory solutions and geographical expansion initiatives continue to support revenue growth. Though total adjusted net revenues declined in 2019 due to lower advisory fees, the same witnessed a CAGR of 16.8% over the last four years (ended 2021). Despite several near-term headwinds, the company's strong backlog and business investments will drive IB business in the upcoming quarters.Though steadily rising operating expenses and negligible revenue generation from the wealth management business are concerns, Evercore maintains a solid balance sheet and liquidity position. Also, the company consistently enhances shareholders' value with steady capital deployment activities.EVR has a market cap of $3.1 billion. Over the past 12 months, shares of the company have declined 38.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ongoing-year earnings has remained unchanged at $9.66 over the past month.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

15,2a0bc294-2a33-35c8-afa9-6052aa3774c1,MMC,2022-10-01,Mercer compensation data reveals US employers are struggling to keep up with employee expectations with high inflation,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercer-compensation-data-reveals-us-143500683.html,1664548500,STORY,['MMC'],"[NEW YORK, September 30, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Mercer released the results of its 2023 US Compensation Planning Survey revealing that while salaries are going up, 2023 compensation budgets and salary projections for US employers are expected to lag behind inflation.While nearly 80% of organizations reported that they are just in the preliminary stages of determining their 2023 annual increase budget, the survey found that overall salaries are going up. Employers reported they are budgeting an average of 3.8% for merit increases – compared to the 3.4%1 actually delivered in 2022 – and 4.2% for their total increase budget for 2023. The total base salary increase budget includes other base pay increases such as promotions and cost of living adjustments, in addition to merit increases.Across industries, Financial Services is leading the market at 4.0% merit and 4.7% total increases. The Healthcare industry is lagging behind the market at 3.3% merit and 3.6% total increases. Interestingly, the Technology industry typically leads the market with their compensation awards, yet the survey found that while Technology employers are right at the national average for total increase (4.2%), there is a slight lag on the national average for merit increases (3.7%) – a departure from previous years.The labor shortage was reported as the top driver for increases in compensation budgets for employers, which aligns with long-standing practices focused on paying based on demand for labor, not inflation or cost of living. The disconnect in compensation budgets and rising inflation is creating frustration with workers, who have seen all of their wage gains eroded by rising costs. This will continue to drive dissatisfaction with compensation programs and pressure employers to increase wages in the months ahead. The tight labor market with high numbers of job openings, low numbers of unemployed workers, and heightened turnover may force employers to respond.Story continuesThe study found that employers’ primary response to inflation is a reactionary one of providing ad-hoc off-cycle wage reviews and/or adjustments (reported by 38% of employers). This is a continuation of practices seen over the last year, which resulted in significant gaps in employers’ total compensation spend relative to budgets for 2022. This is especially true for hourly workers, whose base pay rose on average 6.7%2 in 2022, despite a 3.8%3 total base pay increase budget.""When it comes to compensation decisions, employers are caught in the middle of recessionary concerns, a tight labor market, and shifting employee expectations due to inflation. Given the financial uncertainty that currently exists combined with the tight labor market, employers should consider setting flexible budgets and prioritize investments in critical and fast-moving segments, such as their hourly workforce,"" said Lauren Mason, Senior Principal in Mercer's Career practice.Only 10% of US organizations say that recessionary concerns are having a high impact on their salary increase budgets right now. However, should the economic situation continue to decline, that may change this outcome. The survey found that no employers are currently planning to freeze pay in 2023.Despite an influx of legislation aimed at increasing pay transparency, the survey found employers have been slow to modify their communication of pay ranges outside of state mandates. Over half (53%) of organizations said they will comply with local laws and have no plans to broaden transparency beyond what is required. As it stands today, 44% of organizations do not communicate any information regarding an employee’s current compensation grade or band, and only 21% of employers make available compensation bands for all jobs outside the employee’s current role.""With more states requiring external publication of pay ranges on job postings, it is critical that organizations build their own story around compensation because without the right context, employees will create their own narrative,"" added Mason. ""Organizations should also remember that pay is only one tool in their toolkit; take a broader view of total rewards and implement benefits that help meet workers’ needs – particularly those that are low to no cost, but of high value – like flexible working, or financial wellness programs.""About Mercer’s US Compensation Planning SurveyThe US Compensation Planning Survey includes data from more than 1200 US organizations of varying sizes across 15 industries.

Carnival's 2023 book position are only slightly above 2019 levels, and management now expects a slightly negative fourth quarter EBITDA, or another way of calling that would be operating profits.Not too surprised here, Brad, just given we have seen increased discounting on cruise lines. We have seen some pullbacks in various trips related to Hurricane Ian. That impacted more on the fourth quarter. But the economy is slowing down. And a lot of these cruises are booked six months to a year in advance. So if you've lost a job now, you're feeling concerned about your outlook, you're probably not spending thousands of dollars today to go book a cruise.BRAD SMITH: And for the cruise lines themselves, which would be highly kind of hinging on these re-engagement campaigns to really drum up even more fanfare among what is a very loyal consortium of the experience economy in cruisegoers, and I-- you're not going to put me on a cruise. Like, I just can't get into it.BRIAN SOZZI: No?BRAD SMITH: No, I'm not-- I don't do the deep sea stuff. But for the cruise line operators, it's been, OK, how do we increase the amounts that people are spending, even when they are on board the ships? And I think within that, you've got this micro economy that also needs to take place within that ship experience so that the cruise liners see higher fares that they're able to charge, even as they are trying to say, all right, yeah, we're charging a higher fare, but we're also going to throw a discount on top of that. So net, net, you'll be fine.However, they're going to look on the other side to get you to spend more when you're in that experience. And so this kind of has a twofold impact. If you're seeing them have to spend more in the marketing expenses, more money out the door there, and then hoping that a consumer that is saying, all right, yeah, for the entire family to be able to go on this cruise experience, we're going to need the promotion. And also, we're going to need to cut back on our spending while we're on the ship, too.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: I've got to try to convince you on the cruise. You go in there.BRAD SMITH: Can't.BRIAN SOZZI: You drop your bag in the room, Brad. You go to the bar. You lose track of time. You have no life. All you're doing is you're there. You take your drinks, you go to the hot tub. It's great. You can go to a concert at night. Oh, Brad.BRAD SMITH: No.BRIAN SOZZI: It's so good.BRAD SMITH: I need to see land.BRIAN SOZZI: Would you take a cruise first or get on Amazon Prime first?BRAD SMITH: Ah. Ooh, that's tough.BRIAN SOZZI: We'll take that out.BRAD SMITH: That's tough, yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: We'll take that the other side of the break.]"

This was driven by the adoption of intelligent power and sensing solutions in the markets like automotive due to the electric vehicle (EV) megatrend.Due to rising inflation, industrial and residential buildings will be looking for lighting solutions that provide high efficiency with higher power savings to lower operations cost.

Per onsemi, the SiC total addressable market is projected to grow from $2 billion in 2021 to $6.5 billion in 2026, at a CAGR of 33%.Further, positively impacting onsemi’s decision to expand operations in high-growth markets is President Biden's decision to sign the CHIPS and Science Act, supporting investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign markets like China. Onsemi peer Microchip Technology MCHP is also looking to benefit from the recent declaration of the act by the government.The declaration will help Microchip to diversify income from its microcontroller business, which is riddled with supply-chain disturbances.  Microchip continues developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed-signal, power, interface and timing products to spur growth in the analog business.However, ON is facing stiff competition from Texas Instruments TXN and STMicroelectronics STM.STMicroelectronics’ third-generation STPOWER SiC MOSFETs help meet the energy-saving efficiency requirements in EVs and are a chief competitor of onsemi in the EV market. STMicroelectronics’ solutions will help EV makers achieve faster charging and reduce EV weight. This helps STM win a significant market share in the industry.Texas Instruments is also seeing success in certain fast-growing automotive market segments. TXN is focused on infotainment, safety and ADAS, body electronics (including lighting), hybrid electric vehicle and powertrain segments of the automotive market. It also experiences significant traction from the EV megatrend.However, onsemi expects demand to continue outpacing supply throughout 2022.

Prices jumped sharply during the 14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET) time frame and even cracked the $20,000 threshold shortly after a speech on global financial stability by U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard. BTC then retreated to a range between $19,500 and $20,000 in the subsequent hours but experienced a sudden sell-off right before the U.S. equity market close.Brainard reiterated the Federal Reserve’s commitment to taming inflation, even at the expense of a hard economic landing. “Inflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional inflationary shocks cannot be ruled out,” she said at an event in New York.Ether’s (ETH) price recently rose to about $1,340, a 0.4% gain from the same time the previous day.

Its return on investment (ROI) has fallen 13% in the past 30 days as equity markets wrapped up the third quarter.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 0.76%.“It's been a very choppy week in bitcoin, which has failed to make a sustainable run in either direction despite attempts at both,” Oanda Senior Analyst Craig Erlam wrote in an email, although he noted that bitcoin seemed to be forming a floor “a little shy of the early summer lows around $17,500.”“I keep using the word resilience when discussing bitcoin and that has very much remained the case,” he wrote, adding: “Perhaps a period of stability is what it needs.”Economic calendarThe core personal consumption expenditure (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of U.S. inflation, was hotter than expected in August, rising 4.9% on a year-over-year basis after increasing 4.7% in July.Looking ahead, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for September issued in the U.S. and the U.K. will be released on Monday. The indexes will offer the latest evidence of manufacturing activity in both countries and the direction of their economies, which now seem to point to a sharper economic slowdown than their central banks had been hoping.Story continuesU.S. equitiesU.S. equities slogged through a dreary day, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 (which has a heft technology component) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining 0.8%, 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index results for August, released Friday, spooked investors already fretting about high inflation.The PCE, which excludes energy costs, is a widely watched measure of price trends. Stocks have fallen steadily downward this year, with the DJIA this week becoming the latest index to fall into bear market territory, meaning it has fallen at least 20% from its previous high.CommoditiesGold ticked down a fraction of a percentage point, continuing a recent trend.

QNT was recently trading at about $143, a roughly 27% increase over the past seven days.The price of QNT has surged over the past seven days. (CoinDesk).The increase comes as U.S. and foreign agencies wrestle with a vast array of cryptocurrency regulatory issues, including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.Last week, as CoinDesk reported, U.S. House Democrats hashing out the details of this year's stablecoin regulation bill pushed for a provision directing the Federal Reserve to move forward on a digital dollar, but the negotiations settled instead on another Fed study. Even that compromise is on uncertain ground as the legislation hasn't yet been issued publicly.The draft of the House bill, which is now circulating among lawmakers and the industry, won’t yet represent the authorization Fed officials have said they are waiting for from Congress before they decide to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The federal government has been inching closer to such an approval, with the U.S. Treasury Department recommending in a recent report that work on a digital dollar should continue while the executive branch also comes to a decision.Noting Quant’s CDBC business, Crypto Finance AG sales trader David Scheuermann wrote in a note that “it's no secret that governments are pushing to crack down on current stablecoins, and exploring their own digital currencies, CBDCs.”He added: “These recent political developments have sparked rumors of central banks adopting Quant Network’s overledger technology for CBDC developments,” said Scheuermann.Altcoin RoundupCryptocurrencies XRP, MKR Shine as BTC, ETH Hold Steady Ahead of US Inflation Figure: Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP climbed above its 200-day moving average while maker (MKR) hit a three-week high.

Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joins us with the details. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hi, Rachelle. That's right. And the Biden administration wants to limit fuel exports because what it's trying to do is increase the inventories of fuel in the East Coast. Well, the ExxonMobil sent a letter to the energy department. It was reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. And it was signed by Darren Woods, the CEO of ExxonMobil. And basically, what he's warning about is refineries in the Gulf Coast creating a glut there because this fuel would not really get to the East Coast.Basically, this glut would cause refineries to stop or to cut down on their output. Now, fuel exports are near record highs right now. And this is simply because of the energy crisis that's going on in Europe. We know that diesel, we know that heating oil will be in demand as the winter comes in. And this is really, though, a continuation of the push-pull between the energy industry and the Biden administration.Now, you do have gasoline prices that are at an average of $3.79 per gallon. Remember when they were above $5 per gallon back in June. Well, they have eased somewhat. And part of this, of course, is because of the price of oil. If we look at our YFi Interactive, WTI today down. But I'm going to pull up a quarter to date because this is significant. WTI down 23% quarter to date. You've got Brent crude that's down 18% quarter to date.This is because of recession fears. This is because of the lockdowns in China. And it's also because of the strong dollar. And you can expect to perhaps see oil rally somewhat next week if OPEC+ announces production cuts, guys.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Ines Ferre, thanks so much for that. Appreciate it. Enjoy the weekend as well.]"

These Emails Suggest Otherwise.Loretta Lynn, Coal Miner's Daughter And Country Queen, DiesStocks Take Breather After Furious Rally From Low: Markets WrapMar-a-Lago Documents Included Pardons, Emails, Legal BillsThe company didn’t disclose terms of the planned share sale in its filing Friday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mobileye will continue to be controlled by Intel after the IPO, according to the filing.Intel expects the IPO to value Mobileye at as much as $30 billion, less than originally hoped, Bloomberg News reported this month.If the listing goes ahead this year, it would be one of the biggest US offerings of 2022. Currently, only two companies have raised $1 billion or more on New York exchanges since Jan. 1, compared with 45 in 2021. This year, the US share of IPOs has shrunk to less then a seventh of the global total from half in 2021.Mobileye would also be following in the tracks of Porsche AG’s market-defying IPO in Frankfurt this week. That €9.4 billion ($9.2 billion) listing is the world’s second biggest this year and the largest since stock markets began their volatility- and inflation-driven downward spiral in January.Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is trying to capitalize on Jerusalem-based Mobileye, acquired in 2017 for $15 billion, with a partial spinoff of its shares. Mobileye makes chips for cameras and drive-assistance features, and is seen as a prized asset as the car industry races toward fully automated vehicles.EyeQ ShipmentsNow with about 3,100 employees, Mobileye has collected data from 8.6 billion miles on the road from eight testing sites globally, according to its filing. the company says its technology leads in the race to shift the automotive industry away from human drivers. It’s shipped 117 million units of its EyeQ product.Story continuesMobileye has been a particularly bright spot for Intel and has consistently grown faster than its parent. As of July, it had $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the 12 months ended Dec. 25, it had a net loss of $75 million on revenue of $1.39 billion.The company said it plans to use proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt and for working capital and general corporate purposes.McCaskill, HuntsmanMobileye said in its filing that its board will include Gelsinger as chairman, and also former US Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, and Jon Huntsman, the former Republican governor of Utah as well as ambassador to China who is now on Ford Motor Co.’s board.In its filing, Mobileye noted that it acquired mobility and transportation business Moovit from Intel this year. Moovit, another Israeli-based business, had been acquired by Intel for $900 million in 2020.A successful Mobileye listing could break the ice for an array of startups that have been waiting for the year’s market tumult to ease before moving ahead with IPOs.More specifically, it could clear a growing logjam of chip-related assets waiting to come to market. SoftBank Group Corp. also is trying to sell shares of semiconductor designer Arm Ltd. by early next year. Ampere Computing LLC, a startup making processors for data centers, is planning an IPO as well.The Mobileye offering is being led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley.

The tree-trimming project will ensure better upkeep of trees, enhance electric service reliability and reduce the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages, especially during severe weather conditions.As part of the $33 million vegetation management program, Potomac Edison will cut trees along nearly 3,100 miles of distribution power lines in Maryland and West Virginia this year. Instead of sending ground crews to each facility, FE is deploying aerial saw services that are quicker and more effective in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week.Need for MaintenanceMaintaining vegetation along power lines is the first defense mechanism in preventing tree-related power outages. This ensures that transmission lines operate properly during extreme weather to efficiently transfer high-voltage power from generation units to designated locations.FirstEnergy is working steadily on maintaining its infrastructure. It employs tree contractors annually who work round the year to ensure proper vegetation management in the company’s electric lines. The aerial saw service used by FE cleanly cuts tree limbs 8-10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. This fast, secure and efficient method of tree-trimming reduced service interruption by 20% in 2021 compared with 2019.On Sep 14, 2022, FirstEnergy’s another unit, The Illuminating Company, completed the vegetation management of a complex $3 million tree-trimming project for nearly 100 power lines in the City of Cleveland. The project will enhance electric service reliability for more than 25,000 customers and provide greater flexibility to restore power outages during the upcoming winter storm season.Story continuesUtilities’ Focus on InfrastructureTo provide 24X7 electricity supply to consumers, utilities are investing heavily in strengthening their infrastructure. They are replacing old transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding distribution lines and going for technological upgrades to increase the resiliency of infrastructure for withstanding the impact of extreme weather conditions. Xcel Energy XEL, NiSource NI and Pinnacle West Capital PNW are some of the leading utilities.Xcel Energy continues to invest substantially in its utility assets and aims to strengthen and expand its transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects. XEL aims to spend $26 billion during the 2022-2026 period, which includes $1.5 to $2.5 billion in incremental opportunities.NiSource is working on a long-term utility infrastructure modernization program and made capital investments worth $1.9 billion in 2021. It plans to invest in the range of $2.4-$2.7 billion in 2022. NI estimated $40-billion long-term natural gas and electric infrastructure investment opportunities, which are expected to drive earnings beyond 2024.To efficiently serve its expanding customer base, Pinnacle West Capital has systematic investment plans to increase generation and strengthen its transmission and distribution lines. After investing $1.5 billion in 2021, it aims at investing $1.53 billion in 2022.  Pinnacle West Capital also plans to invest $4.7 billion during the 2022-2024 period.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, FirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 71% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Microsoft. View our latest analysis for Microsoft ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Microsoft?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Microsoft's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Microsoft. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.4% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MicrosoftWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$779m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 29% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors.

After Friday, she will become an adviser to the board and to the chief executive officer, Bobby Kotick.“Fran did a truly exceptional job—actually four jobs—with continuously increasing responsibilities and the most exemplary work ethic,” Kotick wrote in an email shared with Bloomberg News. “Fran also has done an extraordinary job enhancing the strong governance and compliance programs we have throughout the Company.”Jen Brewer, the senior vice president of ethics and compliance, and Luci Altman, the senior vice president of corporate governance, will fill Townsend’s role. Brewer has been with the company for over a decade. The Wall Street Journal reported the move earlier Friday.Townsend previously held positions as a counter-terrorism adviser to President George W. Bush’s White House and as a general council for MacAndrews &amp; Forbes. Shortly after taking the job at Activision, Townsend said she would focus on customer safety and the security of their personally identifying information. She also said she would look into loot boxes, a mechanic for obtaining in-game cosmetics that is sometimes likened to gambling.In July 2021, shortly after a California state agency complaint alleged endemic sexism at Activision Blizzard, Townsend’s response to the claims were roundly criticized. She described them in an internal letter as “factually incorrect, old, and out of context.” Over 2,000 current and former employees of the company signed a letter calling Activision Blizzard leaders’ response to the discrimination suit “abhorrent and insulting.”Story continuesKotick ultimately took responsibility for the incident, saying Townsend shouldn’t be blamed.

Although there may still be risk ahead, investors might want to begin pondering Warren Buffett’s most famous investment strategy; be greedy when others are fearful.Of course, the other half of this famous quote is to be fearful when others are greedy, but opportunities are starting to brew. In particular, big tech stocks are beginning to present solid opportunities for patient investors to start building positions.Buffet’s mentor Benjamin Graham is famous for insisting that investors look at large declines in the stock market as a discount or sale, rather than panic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAs we can see from the chart above, the Nasdaq is up +800% over the last 20 years. There is a clear path upward after the financial crisis in 2008. Surely investors were panicking during these times, but it was symbolic of the discount that Graham often referred to.Let’s take a look at two quality tech stocks that have a chance to go back to their previous highs once macroeconomic conditions stabilize.Amazon AMZN After a recent 20-for-1 stock split, Amazon is trading at its most affordable level in over a decade in terms of the face value of its stock price. Amazon’s stock had routinely traded over $2,000 a share. Investors can now buy the stock for $113 a share, which is also 39% beneath its 52-week highs.AMZN currently sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and inflation may continue taking its toll on consumer e-commerce spending. However, Amazon is still a very viable investment for growth. According to Zacks estimates, Amazon’s earnings are expected to drop -93% this year but fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to rebound and climb an impressive 956% at $2.21 a share.This is also back to its 2020 levels when the company saw a boost in e-commerce spending during Covid-19. Top line growth is expected as well, with sales set to climb 11% this year and another 15% in FY23 to $602.52 billion. Amazon’s top line growth from FY21 to FY23 is more than what many of the largest companies make in a year. In comparison, Amazon's sales growth during this time span is larger than Target's TGT annual sales. Story continuesYear to date AMZN is down -32% to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -24%. However, this is on par with the Nasdaq’s -32% drop. Amazon’s peer group has fallen by 40%. With that being said, AMZN has climbed 138% in the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, over the last 10 years, AMZN is up a staggering +787%, crushing the benchmark’s +167%.Plus, AMZN is trading well off its decade-long highs of 8,055.3X and getting closer to the median of 132.6X. Amazon’s price to sales is currently at 2.4X and getting close to the optimum level of less than 2X. The industry average P/S is 1.2X.However, Amazon’s cloud platform AWS has continued to grow most recently contributing to $5.72 billion in operating income during the second quarter, up 36% year over year. Cloud, along with continued efforts in expanding its streaming services through Amazon Prime has shown the company can make good use of its $60 billion cash on hand. The average Zacks Price Target offers 55% upside from Amazon’s current levels.Microsoft MSFT Microsoft is one of the largest broad-based technology providers in the world. Microsoft’s products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games.Microsoft’s growth in the cloud and its savvy acquisitions have helped MSFT maintain its standing as a Computer-Software industry leader. During its fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenue climbed 20% to $20.9 billion. This was largely due to its public cloud computing platform Azure. The growth of Azure along with acquiring LinkedIn and countless others, including the possible future acquisition of Activision Blizzard help Microsoft continue growing and innovating through multiple revenue streams. MSFT is down -30% year to date to underperform the S&amp;P 500. This is on par with the Computer-Software Market’s -32% drop. However, over the last five years, Microsoft is up +213%. Even better, over the last decade, MSFT is up an impressive +690% to crush the Computer-Software Market and the benchmark’s +167%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stellar 10-year price performance in the chart above may be a reason for investors to be optimistic about this year’s decline in MSFT. The -30% YTD drop could very well be a healthy correction for the long term and perhaps a chance to start adding positions at a discount. Microsoft is 33% off its 52-week highs, trading around $232 a share. MSFT has a forward P/E of 23.5X, which is near the industry average. This is also lower than its decade high of 37.4X and near the median of 23.7X.According to Zacks estimates, MSFT earnings are expected to rise 9% to $10.09 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to climb another 15%. Microsoft’s sales are projected to be up 11% this year and another 13% in FY23 to $249.93 billion.Microsoft has also flexed its impressive balance sheet with its most recent $60 billion share repurchase program. Such notable buybacks increase the value of remaining shares for investors with MSFT also boosting its dividend six times in the last five years. MSFT’s current annual dividend yield is a modest 1.04% at $2.48 a share.MSFT currently lands a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) and its Computer-Software Industry is in the bottom 39% of over 250 Zacks Industries. However, the average Zacks Price target offers 39% upside from current levels.Bottom Line While it may not be time to be greedy, the decline among big tech stocks is creating what could turn out to be a valuable opportunity for investors. It will be important for investors to stay focused and not panic during downturns.There may be more downside risks ahead, however this allows time to start building meaningful positions. Stocks like Amazon and Microsoft have greatly rewarded patient investors over the last decade and after this downcycle, their stellar performances could continue.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Not really,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-did-pandemic-finally-working-130000229.html,1664542800,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Union-organizing victories at Starbucks may obscure the longer-term decline in union membership, and consequently worker leverage. (Matt Rourke / Associated Press)Labor advocates have been feeling their oats lately, what with a surge of successful union organizing drives at Starbucks stores, the hint of union interest at Amazon warehouses, higher minimum wage standards in cities and states across the country, and a nudge up of average wages across the board.These trends have inspired some to proclaim the advent of a new era of worker power.""The labor market is experiencing a Great Upgrade,"" the progressive Roosevelt Institute declared in February.Most indicators show either declining labor power or give mixed signals.Teresa Ghilarducci, New School“We’re in a moment where, politically, workers are ascendant,” David Madland of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, told the investment publication Barron's in May. (The article's headline read: ""How Workers Gained an Edge — and Why They Won’t Lose It Soon."")Unfortunately, this sort of confidence can be a drug that invites dangerous overdoses. That's the view of economist Teresa Ghilarducci of the New School.Ghilarducci recently compiled a roster of economic indicators suggesting that workers haven't gained as much leverage as a superficial examination might suggest. Even the advances thus far, such as they are, still leave miles to travel before the American working class recovers all the economic standing it has lost since the 1970s.""A lot of the talk about labor having power is based on organizing efforts at Starbucks and Amazon,"" Ghilarducci told me. Of 11 economic indicators she examined, she says, ""most indicators show either declining labor power or give mixed signals.""Ghilarducci is not aiming to be a killjoy just for the hell of it. The condition of the labor market is critically important because the Federal Reserve Board is convinced that the tight labor market is an important factor driving inflation higher. Consequently, its inflation-fighting approach involves kneecapping worker bargaining power.Who's got the power? Corporate profits (red line) have grown sevenfold since 1994 — and faster since the pandemic — while labor's share of the economy (blue line) has stagnated. (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)Fed Chairman Jerome H. Powell has explicitly stated that unemployment must rise for inflation to come down. ""The labor market has remained extremely tight,"" Powell said at his Sept. 21 news conference after the Fed's monthly decision to raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point for the third time in a row.Story continuesAs evidence for the tight labor market, Powell cited ""the unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies near historical highs, and wage growth elevated ... with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers."" He concluded, with evident regret, ""So far, there's only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off.""Yet if the labor market hasn't been tight enough to provide workers with real gains in wages and living standards, the Fed's approach threatens to take away the lackluster gains they have achieved in the last year.So let's examine what has really been happening on the labor front.The most important indicator is wage growth. Although pay has been rising, wages have been outstripped by price inflation. In raw terms, average nonfarm hourly wages rose by 5.2% in the year that ended in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In real terms, however — that is, accounting for inflation — they fell by 2.8% in that period.The Fed's approach is based on an economic concept known as the Phillips curve, which posits a concrete relationship between unemployment and inflation (as unemployment rises, inflation falls and vice versa).As I reported previously, though, this is a mechanistic approach that harks back to pre-Depression policy, when working men and women were regarded as just another economic input and downturns were valued as necessary medicine to preserve the financial well-being of the bondholding class.It was the era when the prescription for an economic downturn offered by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, one of the richest men in America, was “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate,” as Herbert Hoover described Mellon’s argument in his own memoirs.There's reason to doubt that the relationship applies to today's variety of inflation, which has been generated by factors such as pandemic-related supply chain obstacles and an aggressive expansion of corporate profits. The Phillips curve also depends on an accurate reading of unemployment.As Ghilarducci observes, the published unemployment rate of 3.7% may be artificially low because it doesn't account for workers who may still be kept out of the workforce by long COVID. As their illness abates, they may come flooding back into the workforce — a ""large reserve army of labor,"" as she calls it, indicating that the market isn't nearly as tight as the Fed believes.In any event, the fact that wage growth has lagged behind price inflation suggests that the first can't be driving inflation higher — if anything, it's holding inflation down.The inadequacy of wage growth is shown by two other factors. One is the disconnect between productivity growth and wage growth. The two factors marched along together from 1948 until 1979, as the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute has shown. Since then, the gap between them has grown: From 1979 through 2020, U.S. productivity advanced by 61.8%, but average wages grew by only 17.5%.Productivity growth (dark blue) and wage growth (light blue) began to diverge in 1979, and the gap has widened ever since then. (Economic Policy Institute)The second factor is the value of the federal minimum wage, which peaked in 1970 at an inflation-adjusted $12.04 per hour (in 2022 dollars). Today it's mired at $7.75, where it was set in 2009.Another trend worth examining is labor's share of national income compared with corporate profits (which are upstreamed to executives and shareholders). Since 1994, corporate profits have grown sevenfold while the labor share has been stagnant. Since the pandemic took hold in the first half of 2020, corporate profits have doubled while labor has lost ground.It's proper to note that white-collar workers gained significant freedoms as a result of the pandemic, including the health-giving ability to work from home, while the laboring class — those so-called essential workers — were forced to report to work at restaurants and retail stores, at great risk to their health. It's those more privileged workers, however, who are now facing more pressure, even mandates, to work from the office and figuratively punch the clock.The union activism that has brought representation to workers at 234 Starbucks locations in 36 states and the District of Columbia this year is certainly encouraging, but it's a work in progress. The company owns 9,000 stores nationally. Moreover, the company has resisted cooperating on the crucial next step, which is negotiating contracts with those organized workers.Thus far, negotiations have been underway at only three locations, although the company said Monday that it is willing to open negotiations next month at all the unionized stores.The Starbucks victories are overshadowed by the long-term decline of union representation in the U.S., which continued through the pandemic. Union membership shrank in 2021 to 14 million, down by 241,000 from the year before, with the percentage of union-represented workers falling to 10.3%. In 1983, when the government started compiling statistics, the U.S. had 17.7 million unionized workers, 20.1% of the workforce.As unions struggle to retain their collective strength, mergers among employers outpace them, reducing the options for workers seeking to move to new jobs and strengthening employers' power.The truth is that worker power can't grow unless it's abetted by government oversight. Regulation of labor and workplace safety practices has been stifled over the years.""In recent years,"" the Treasury Department observed in a March report, ""the probability of a firm being inspected has decreased sharply."" The government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, for example, conducted 140,000 inspections in 1984; by 2019, the number had fallen to 81,000, and declined further during the pandemic.Only recently, with new regulatory initiatives by the uniquely pro-union Biden administration, has oversight of working conditions and union organizing drives by the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board improved.Despite the reality on the ground, the Federal Reserve, which has more power than any other American institution to guide the course of the U.S. economy, is still wringing its hands over signs that demand for workers is ""substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,"" as Powell put it on Sept. 21. He took that as a sign that the labor market is so tight that wages will be forced higher.The Fed's medicine is aimed at reducing that imbalance by slowing the economy, thereby reducing demand for workers and thus the latter's ability to recover the ground they have lost in an economy that has been wholly favorable to employers for some 40 years.Powell says his aim is to ""set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable prices over the longer run."" Working people who are still struggling to fulfill the dream of a middle-class existence that has been the American promise since the 1940s might well wonder whether Dr. Powell's cure will be worse than the disease.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The tree-trimming project will ensure better upkeep of trees, enhance electric service reliability and reduce the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages, especially during severe weather conditions.As part of the $33 million vegetation management program, Potomac Edison will cut trees along nearly 3,100 miles of distribution power lines in Maryland and West Virginia this year. Instead of sending ground crews to each facility, FE is deploying aerial saw services that are quicker and more effective in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week.Need for MaintenanceMaintaining vegetation along power lines is the first defense mechanism in preventing tree-related power outages. This ensures that transmission lines operate properly during extreme weather to efficiently transfer high-voltage power from generation units to designated locations.FirstEnergy is working steadily on maintaining its infrastructure. It employs tree contractors annually who work round the year to ensure proper vegetation management in the company’s electric lines. The aerial saw service used by FE cleanly cuts tree limbs 8-10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. This fast, secure and efficient method of tree-trimming reduced service interruption by 20% in 2021 compared with 2019.On Sep 14, 2022, FirstEnergy’s another unit, The Illuminating Company, completed the vegetation management of a complex $3 million tree-trimming project for nearly 100 power lines in the City of Cleveland. The project will enhance electric service reliability for more than 25,000 customers and provide greater flexibility to restore power outages during the upcoming winter storm season.Story continuesUtilities’ Focus on InfrastructureTo provide 24X7 electricity supply to consumers, utilities are investing heavily in strengthening their infrastructure. They are replacing old transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding distribution lines and going for technological upgrades to increase the resiliency of infrastructure for withstanding the impact of extreme weather conditions. Xcel Energy XEL, NiSource NI and Pinnacle West Capital PNW are some of the leading utilities.Xcel Energy continues to invest substantially in its utility assets and aims to strengthen and expand its transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects. XEL aims to spend $26 billion during the 2022-2026 period, which includes $1.5 to $2.5 billion in incremental opportunities.NiSource is working on a long-term utility infrastructure modernization program and made capital investments worth $1.9 billion in 2021. It plans to invest in the range of $2.4-$2.7 billion in 2022. NI estimated $40-billion long-term natural gas and electric infrastructure investment opportunities, which are expected to drive earnings beyond 2024.To efficiently serve its expanding customer base, Pinnacle West Capital has systematic investment plans to increase generation and strengthen its transmission and distribution lines. After investing $1.5 billion in 2021, it aims at investing $1.53 billion in 2022.  Pinnacle West Capital also plans to invest $4.7 billion during the 2022-2024 period.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, FirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a special cash dividend of $18.50 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments under options granted under its stock options plans. The record date for the special dividend is August 19, 2022, and the payment date for the dividend is August 26, 2022.(PRNewsfoto/TransDigm Group Incorporated)Third quarter highlights include:Net sales of $1,398 million, up 15% from $1,218 million in the prior year's quarter;Income from continuing operations of $239 million;Earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.10;EBITDA As Defined of $696 million, up 25% from $559 million in the prior year's quarter;EBITDA As Defined margin of 49.8%, up 390 basis points from the prior year's quarter;Adjusted earnings per share of $4.85, up 46% from $3.33 in the prior year's quarter;Strong operating cash flow generation of $309 million; andRepurchase of $245 million of Company stock during the quarter, equating to 443,598 shares.The Company's full fiscal 2022 guidance remains suspended as a result of the continued disruption in our primary commercial end markets. Refer to the ""Fiscal 2022 Outlook"" section below for further information.Quarter-to-Date ResultsNet sales for the quarter increased 14.8%, or $180 million, to $1,398 million from $1,218 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 16.7%.Income from continuing operations for the quarter decreased $78 million, or 24.6%, to $239 million from $317 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. The decrease in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the higher effective tax rate and a pension settlement charge for the Esterline Retirement Plan. The comparable quarter a year ago also included the benefit of the net gain on sale recognized as a result of the divestitures completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. These unfavorable items contributing to the decrease in income from continuing operations were partially offset by the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix, along with lower one-time refinancing costs.Story continuesAdjusted net income for the quarter increased 44.8% to $281 million, or $4.85 per share, from $194 million, or $3.33 per share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.EBITDA for the quarter increased 12.4% to $643 million from $572 million for the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the quarter increased 24.5% to $696 million compared with $559 million in the comparable quarter a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 49.8% compared with 45.9% in the comparable quarter a year ago.During the thirteen week period ended July 2, 2022, TransDigm repurchased 443,598 shares of its common stock with a weighted-average price per share of $553.62 at an aggregate cost of approximately $245 million.As previously reported, on May 25, 2022, TransDigm completed the acquisition of DART Aerospace (""DART""), a portfolio company of Greenbriar Equity Group, L.P., for approximately $360 million in cash. DART is an industry leader in helicopter mission equipment with established positions on a diverse range of rotary-wing platforms.""Global air traffic continues to trend upwards with the pent-up demand for air travel. This positive momentum bodes well for the commercial aerospace recovery. Domestic air travel remains the leader in the air traffic recovery, but the international air traffic recovery made strides these past few months as more passengers returned to long-haul travel,"" stated Kevin Stein, TransDigm Group's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""I am pleased to see another quarter of sequential improvement in our commercial aftermarket revenues, with the commercial aftermarket bookings for the quarter outpacing revenues. We also saw further sequential expansion of our EBITDA As Defined margin this quarter to 49.8%. This was a result of the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues, coupled with careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy.During the quarter, we returned $245 million of capital to shareholders via open market repurchases of our common stock. We view these repurchases like any other capital investment, and we expect this investment will meet or exceed our long-term return objectives.Additionally, given the significant amount of cash currently available, our solid operating performance and ongoing expectations, we believe that this is the appropriate time to declare and pay a special dividend, as we have done in the past. The payout of a special dividend of $18.50 per share will leave us with significant liquidity and financial flexibility to meet any likely range of capital requirements or other opportunities.In the aggregate, thus far this fiscal year, we have deployed approximately $2.4 billion of capital across the DART acquisition, today's announced dividend, and share repurchases.  As you know, we are always continuously evaluating our capital allocation options and are pleased to have deployed this amount of capital across the range of options available to us.""Year-to-Date ResultsNet sales for the thirty-nine week period ended July 2, 2022 increased 11.4%, or $400 million, to $3,919 million from $3,519 million in the comparable period a year ago. Organic sales growth as a percentage of net sales was 13.6%.Income from continuing operations for the thirty-nine week period ended July 2, 2022 increased $128 million, or 27.1%, to $601 million from $473 million in the comparable period a year ago. The increase in income from continuing operations primarily reflects the increase in net sales described above and favorable sales mix, along with lower COVID-19 restructuring costs and lower one-time refinancing costs, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The comparable period a year ago also included the benefit of the net gain on sale recognized as a result of the divestitures completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2021.GAAP earnings per share were reduced in fiscal 2022 and 2021 by $0.78 per share and $1.24 per share, respectively, as a result of dividend equivalent payments made during each year. As a reminder, GAAP earnings per share are reduced when TransDigm makes dividend equivalent payments pursuant to the Company's stock option plans. These dividend equivalent payments are made during the Company's first fiscal quarter each year and also upon payment of any special dividends.Adjusted net income for the thirty-nine week period ended July 2, 2022 increased 48.9% to $685 million, or $11.68 per share, from $460 million, or $7.88 per share, in the comparable period a year ago.EBITDA for the thirty-nine week period ended July 2, 2022 increased 24.0% to $1,753 million from $1,414 million for the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined for the period increased 22.0% to $1,894 million compared with $1,552 million in the comparable period a year ago. EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales for the period was 48.3% compared with 44.1% in the comparable period a year ago.During the thirty-nine week period ended July 2, 2022, TransDigm repurchased 1,490,413 shares of its common stock with a weighted-average price per share of $612.13 at an aggregate cost of approximately $912 million. As previously reported, on January 27, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2,200 million stock repurchase program to replace the existing program permitting the repurchase of a portion of TransDigm's outstanding shares. As of July 2, 2022, the remaining amount of repurchases allowed under the new program was approximately $1,288 million.Please see the attached tables for a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, and adjusted net income; a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined, and a reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the periods discussed in this press release.Fiscal 2022 OutlookGiven the considerable uncertainty around the extent and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our primary commercial OEM and commercial aftermarket end markets, the Company is not providing full fiscal year 2022 guidance.

TransDigm Group defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and defines EBITDA As Defined as EBITDA plus certain non-operating items recorded as corporate expenses, including non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive plans, restructuring costs related to TransDigm Group's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition and divestiture transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. COVID-19 restructuring costs represent actions taken by the Company to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand, as well as incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations (e.g., additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements, personal protective equipment). Acquisition and divestiture-related costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold; costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the Company's operations, facility relocation costs and other acquisition-related costs; transaction-related costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees; legal, financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments. TransDigm Group defines adjusted net income as net income plus purchase accounting backlog amortization expense, effects from the sale on businesses, non-cash compensation charges incurred in connection with TransDigm Group's stock incentive plans, restructuring costs related to TransDigm Group's cost reduction measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currency gains and losses, acquisition-integration costs, acquisition transaction-related expenses, and refinancing costs. EBITDA As Defined Margin represents EBITDA As Defined as a percentage of net sales. TransDigm Group defines adjusted diluted earnings per share as adjusted net income divided by the total shares for basic and diluted earnings per share. For more information regarding the computation of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined and adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, please see the attached financial tables.TransDigm Group presents these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that they are useful indicators of its operating performance. TransDigm Group believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes, capitalized asset values and employee compensation structures, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In addition, analysts, rating agencies and others use EBITDA to evaluate a company's ability to incur and service debt. EBITDA As Defined is used to measure TransDigm Inc.'s compliance with the financial covenant contained in its credit facility. TransDigm Group's management also uses EBITDA As Defined to review and assess its operating performance, to prepare its annual budget and financial projections and to review and evaluate its management team in connection with employee incentive programs. Moreover, TransDigm Group's management uses EBITDA As Defined to evaluate acquisitions and as a liquidity measure. In addition, TransDigm Group's management uses adjusted net income as a measure of comparable operating performance between time periods and among companies as it is reflective of changes in pricing decisions, cost controls and other factors that affect operating performance.None of EBITDA, EBITDA As Defined, EBITDA As Defined Margin, adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share is a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, earnings per share, cash flows from operating activities or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, TransDigm Group's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Although we use EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above, the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider any of them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements;the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of EBITDA and EBITDA As Defined;neither EBITDA nor EBITDA As Defined includes the payment of taxes, which is a necessary element of our operations; andEBITDA As Defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations, which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions.Forward-Looking StatementsStatements in this press release that are not historical facts, including statements under the heading ""Fiscal 2022 Outlook,"" are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These Emails Suggest Otherwise.Loretta Lynn, Coal Miner's Daughter And Country Queen, DiesStocks Take Breather After Furious Rally From Low: Markets WrapMar-a-Lago Documents Included Pardons, Emails, Legal BillsThe company didn’t disclose terms of the planned share sale in its filing Friday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Mobileye will continue to be controlled by Intel after the IPO, according to the filing.Intel expects the IPO to value Mobileye at as much as $30 billion, less than originally hoped, Bloomberg News reported this month.If the listing goes ahead this year, it would be one of the biggest US offerings of 2022. Currently, only two companies have raised $1 billion or more on New York exchanges since Jan. 1, compared with 45 in 2021. This year, the US share of IPOs has shrunk to less then a seventh of the global total from half in 2021.Mobileye would also be following in the tracks of Porsche AG’s market-defying IPO in Frankfurt this week. That €9.4 billion ($9.2 billion) listing is the world’s second biggest this year and the largest since stock markets began their volatility- and inflation-driven downward spiral in January.Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is trying to capitalize on Jerusalem-based Mobileye, acquired in 2017 for $15 billion, with a partial spinoff of its shares. Mobileye makes chips for cameras and drive-assistance features, and is seen as a prized asset as the car industry races toward fully automated vehicles.EyeQ ShipmentsNow with about 3,100 employees, Mobileye has collected data from 8.6 billion miles on the road from eight testing sites globally, according to its filing. the company says its technology leads in the race to shift the automotive industry away from human drivers. It’s shipped 117 million units of its EyeQ product.Story continuesMobileye has been a particularly bright spot for Intel and has consistently grown faster than its parent. As of July, it had $774 million of cash and cash equivalents. In the 12 months ended Dec. 25, it had a net loss of $75 million on revenue of $1.39 billion.The company said it plans to use proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt and for working capital and general corporate purposes.McCaskill, HuntsmanMobileye said in its filing that its board will include Gelsinger as chairman, and also former US Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, and Jon Huntsman, the former Republican governor of Utah as well as ambassador to China who is now on Ford Motor Co.’s board.In its filing, Mobileye noted that it acquired mobility and transportation business Moovit from Intel this year. Moovit, another Israeli-based business, had been acquired by Intel for $900 million in 2020.A successful Mobileye listing could break the ice for an array of startups that have been waiting for the year’s market tumult to ease before moving ahead with IPOs.More specifically, it could clear a growing logjam of chip-related assets waiting to come to market. SoftBank Group Corp. also is trying to sell shares of semiconductor designer Arm Ltd. by early next year. Ampere Computing LLC, a startup making processors for data centers, is planning an IPO as well.The Mobileye offering is being led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Mobileye plans for its shares to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol MBLY.(Updates with Mobileye’s revenue in eighth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMillions in Cryptocurrency Vanished as Agents Watched HelplesslyMusk Won’t Own Twitter Until the Shareholders Get PaidPfizer Needs to Prove It’s Ready to Move On From Covid-19Facebook Is the Only Game in Town for Digital Political AdsBig Tech’s Next Big Thing?

This compares to earnings of $2.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this electronics payment processing company would post earnings of $2.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.07, delivering a surprise of 1.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Global Payments , which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, posted revenues of $2.06 billion for the quarter ended June 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.94 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Global Payments shares have lost about 9.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -13.3%.What's Next for Global Payments?While Global Payments has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Global Payments: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $2.56 on $2.18 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $9.52 on $8.39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Financial Transaction Services is currently in the bottom 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Flyware (FLYW), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2022.

69,c4781b90-f627-3667-b400-689fea318eba,APTV,2022-10-01,7 Large-Cap Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-large-cap-sleeper-stocks-225844881.html,1664319524,STORY,"['BJ', 'QCOM', 'APTV', 'SQM', 'TSLA']","[Today, I want to consider some large-cap sleeper stocks to buy. If you were able to travel back in time one year ago, the current market environment might feel like a bad dream.Twelve months ago, stocks were still in a sustained (albeit somewhat tired-looking) bull run and making new all-time highs. While the Federal Reserve was laying the groundwork for wrapping up its asset purchase program, central bankers were split on whether there would be any interest rate hikes in 2022. Then inflation reared its ugly head, investors began fleeing high-growth stocks and, well, you know how this story goes.Yet, it’s not all doom and gloom. Interest rates remain low from a historical perspective, the labor market is strong, and many large companies are sitting on huge amounts of cash stored up during the pandemic. With each of the three major indices currently in bear-market territory, some of the best stocks are on sale. This presents an opportunity for investors with a long time horizon.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, without further ado, here are seven large-cap sleeper stocks to buy.APTVAptiv$83.00SQMSociedad Química y Minera de Chile$94.34QCOMQualcomm$120.34VWAGYVolkswagen$18.20MDTMedtronic$80.91BJBJ’s Wholesale Club$76.03KEYKeyCorp$15.95Aptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comAptiv (NYSE:APTV) is an automotive technology supplier that, according to CEO Kevin Clark, “will usher in the next generation of active safety, autonomous vehicles, smart cities and connectivity.”The company stands to benefit from a number of concurrent trends even if overall auto market sales decline. First, we are in the midst of a global electric vehicle revolution, with EV market share increasing rapidly in many parts of the world. We are also seeing the proliferation of advanced driver-assistance systems. Finally, autonomous and semi-autonomous driving is starting to gain a foothold.Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, Aptiv’s sales climbed 9% year over year in Q2, and it generated $95 million of cash from operations. In the first half of the year, EBITDA, excluding certain items, came in at an impressive $843 million.Story continuesAnalysts are predicting the company will see revenue increase 10.2% this year to $17.2 billion and another 14.5% next year to $19.7 billion. Meanwhile, earnings per share are expected to jump 22.2% this year to $3.19 and 63% next year to $5.19.Despite its meaningful growth, APTV stock looks undervalued, trading with a forward price-earnings ratio of just 15.8.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)a lithium mineSource: ShutterstockSociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is the world’s largest lithium producer and one of only two names on today’s list of large-cap sleeper stocks to buy that is up over the past 12 months. Shares have advanced more than 90% in the past year. However, they currently sit 18% below their all-time high, made in May.Seeking Alpha columnist Sean Daly recently said the company is “uniquely situated to benefit from the new secular demand for lithium,” noting that lithium-ion battery demand is “expected to grow 22x within the span of this decade.”Much of this demand, of course, comes from the rapidly growing electric vehicle industry, which struggles to get enough refined lithium, according to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. He recently encouraged people to get into the lithium mining business, saying “it’s a license to print money.”Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile would know something about that. In the first half of 2022, the company saw net income soar 940% year over year to nearly $1.7 billion on a 314% jump in revenue.It’s not just about lithium, though. As InvestorPlace columnist and veteran investor Louis Navellier points out, the company is benefitting from the “run-up in fertilizer prices due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict [resulting] in a tremendous jump in revenue and earnings.”Analysts are calling for triple-digit revenue and earnings growth this year, and shares continue to look undervalued, trading with a forward P/E of just 4.9.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on a large sign with another sign that says 5GSource: Xixi Fu / Shutterstock.comShares of semiconductor chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have lost a third of their value in 2022. In addition to the broader tech wreck, the sector is contending with declining PC sales, decelerating data center revenue and anemic flash-memory growth, prompting management teams to lower their forecasts.However, I noted last week amid sector weakness that Qualcomm was a bright spot, reporting it expects “the total addressable market for automotive chips to reach roughly $100 billion by 2030. Moreover, the chipmaker stated that its ‘design-win pipeline’ had jumped to $30 billion, versus its previous estimate of $19 billion.”JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee recently reiterated his “overweight” rating on QCOM stock, saying: “We believe there is limited credit that the company is getting yet for the success of its foray into Automotive and IoT [internet of things], in addition to success in RFFE [radio frequency front end].”Chatterjee’s price target of $185 implies upside of 54% from the current level. Shares look cheap, trading at just 9.3 times forward earnings. QCOM stock is likely to perform very well over the longer term.Volkswagen (VWAGY)A Volkswagen (VWAGY) logo on a sign in Turkey.Source: multitel / Shutterstock.comNext up on my list of large-cap sleeper stocks to buy is Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY), which is set to become a big winner in the EV era. Bloomberg Intelligence predicted in June that the German automaker’s EV sales will surpass those of Tesla starting in 2024. With Volkswagen’s EV sales growing at a fast clip and it set to unveil many more EV models, that seems like a realistic prediction.Meanwhile, Volkswagen has launched its own battery-production unit, PowerCo, to try to overcome supply chain snags. The unit is being financed by Volkswagen and its strategic partners, but management has said it is open to spinning off the unit through an initial public offering.Speaking of IPOs, Volkswagen’s spinoff of Porsche, which is set to happen later this week, is on track to be one of Europe’s biggest initial public offerings. Investors have been enthusiastic about the IPO, which is being done to raise money for Volkswagen’s EV endeavors and should meaningfully improve the company’s balance sheet.VWAGY stock has a minuscule forward P/E ratio of 5.4. However, as successful EV makers begin selling more software subscriptions along with their advanced vehicles, such low valuations are likely to become a thing of the past.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comWhen searching for large-cap sleeper stocks to buy in the face of a possible recession, the health care industry is a good place to look. Medical device maker Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is not likely to be impacted much by an economic downturn. Rather, it should continue to benefit from pent-up demand for routine and elective medical procedures following the pandemic.RBC Capital analyst Shagun Singh has an “outperform” rating on the shares and $110 price target, which is 36% above the current price. Per The Fly, Singh noted, “Medtronic has a robust pipeline focused on technology differentiation while forecasting growth acceleration to mid-to-high single digits as pipeline opportunities fully unfold.”Analysts are forecasting earnings will essentially be flat this year before increasing 5.6% in 2023 to $5.84 per share. MDT stock’s forward P/E ratio of 14.9 looks quite reasonable.BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)BJ Wholesale (BJ) storefront with red BJ logo on frontSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comYou don’t hear about Costco’s (NASDAQ:COST) competitors often, but they exist. Among the most successful is BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ). In fact, it happens to be the only stock besides SQM on today’s list of large-cap sleeper stocks to buy that is in the black over the past year, with shares up 13.5%.The stock’s outperformance is not surprising. With inflation running hot, consumers are looking to cut costs. Many are turning to warehouse clubs to help them accomplish that goal.BJ’s Wholesale reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for the second quarter and raised its earning forecasts for the full year. Comparable sales, excluding gasoline, rose 7.6% year over year.The strong results, which also included a 6% year-over-year increase in member count, promoted Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmesto to upgrade BJ stock to “buy.” “We view BJ’s as well-positioned in both the near-term as well as long-term given its strong value proposition (particularly in fuel, where comp gallons increased 18% in 2Q vs. a down overall market) in a highly inflationary environment which should enable the company to continue to gain share,” Ohmesto said.BJ stock’s forward price-earnings ratio of just under 21 is reasonable. Shares are trading about 5% below their all-time high. While that doesn’t exactly make BJ seem like a sleeper stock, looking back a year from now, investors may feel differently.KeyCorp (KEY)KeyBank storefront logoSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThose who believe, as I do, that the U.S. economy is likely to significantly exceed expectations should consider buying large American regional banks such as KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY).With interest rates rapidly rising, these banks’ net interest income should climb a great deal, significantly lifting their overall financial results. Meanwhile, they are largely insulated from the negative events in Europe.Additionally, I expect U.S. regional banks, in general, and those in the country’s interior, in particular, to benefit meaningfully from the manufacturing/onshoring boom that’s occurring, partly due to the EV and energy revolutions. Based in Ohio, KeyCorp is well-positioned to benefit from those trends.KEY stock has a low forward price-earnings ratio of 6.9 and provides investors with a hefty dividend yield of 4.8%.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(PRNewsfoto/Perrigo Company plc)On August 4, 2022, Perrigo was dismissed from the Madison County, IL, case of Bayer v. Boehringer Ingelheim, et al, with prejudice, meaning the plaintiff's claims against Perrigo in that litigation cannot be refiled. The August 16, 2022 notice of dismissal of claims, and impending trial, against the branded companies did not involve Perrigo. Contrary to the news story, plaintiff's filings contradict the false report that the plaintiff only purchased private label product. In fact, plaintiff's complaint claimed purchases of both brand name Zantac® and private label ranitidine.Importantly, there have been no material developments regarding ranitidine-related litigation to what has been previously disclosed. The industry maintains strong defenses to such claims based on the body of scientific evidence, which indicates there is no causal relationship between ranitidine and cancer. Further, as a private label manufacturer, Perrigo has additional defenses under federal preemption. These defenses have been successfully used to obtain dismissals in the majority of ranitidine cases involving Perrigo. To date, Perrigo has successfully won multiple Motions to Dismiss in the federal multi-district litigation and state court actions in California and Maryland.Perrigo will continue to vigorously defend itself against all meritless claims.About PerrigoPerrigo Company plc (NYSE; PRGO) is a leading provider of Consumer Self-Care Products and over-the-counter (OTC) health and wellness solutions that enhance individual well-being by empowering consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stock in the last year have seen some of their losses recouped as the stock gained 4.0% last week. However, the purchase is proving to be a costly gamble, since losses made by insiders have totalled US$7.9m since the time of purchase.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NetflixOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Co-Founder Wilmot Hastings for US$20m worth of shares, at about US$393 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$235. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Wilmot Hastings was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeNetflix is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Netflix insiders own 1.3% of the company, currently worth about US$1.4b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Netflix Insiders?The fact that there have been no Netflix insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Netflix insiders think the business has merit.

Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal joins us with the details. One might assume it'd be controversial, as everything is around Marilyn Monroe.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, everything pretty controversial. This ""Blonde"" movie has been making waves on the festival circuit. It got a 14-minute standing ovation during the Venice Film Festival. But reviews right now, they're not so strong. Audience score, 38%. Critic score, 48%. And a lot of people are sort of criticizing this, saying that it's exploiting Marilyn Monroe. I still think a lot of other viewers are going to be curious about it. They're going to want to tune in.But when I think about something like ""Blonde,"" obviously, an A-list cast. Ana de Armas-- wasn't a cheap movie to make. I think this paints an interesting picture about Netflix's movie strategy moving forward. And if you think about some of the movies that Netflix has released, ""The Gray Man"" being another recent example, they spent $200 million on that movie. But the big question now is, will it be worth it in the long run, especially when we think about Netflix's bottom line, their emphasis on profitability.If we take a look at some of those viewership numbers, for ""The Gray Man,"" you'll see that there's a pretty steep dropoff in weeks 2 and weeks 3. It actually fell 60% in week 2, another 46% in week 3, along with some of those other big titles out there. Now, all that being said, that's not to say a film like ""The Gray Man"" isn't a success. If you take a look at how many hours were viewed, 245 million hours viewed for that in its first 28 days, so still pretty significant. But I don't think that's enough for Netflix to justify the $200 million price tag.DAVE BRIGGS: Versus the series that stay a flatter number.Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly, and I think, too, Netflix might need to adjust its strategy a little bit. Analysts that I've spoken with said that they're leaving money on the table by not releasing some of these films in theaters first, maybe doing a smaller theatrical window, more wider theatrical release, and then licensing it out potentially to other platforms or keeping it on the Netflix platform. So that's something I think the company is going to have to deal with moving forward.DAVE BRIGGS: Very interesting.RACHELLE AKUFFO: No, it's true. Netflix obviously still figuring quite a few things out. And speaking of that, though, a lot of people, though, talking about Netflix's show on serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's life. What's been the reaction there?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and the reaction-- I mean, if you're just talking from a strictly number perspective, this show went bonkers on its debut, 196.2 million hours watched since its September 21 launch. It's the biggest audience since the return of ""Stranger Things."" It has also beat out the debuts of other top Netflix shows, like ""Inventing Anna"" and ""You."" Now, this show in particular largely tells the story from the point of view of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims, also a big emphasis on the police incompetence there and how Dahmer was able to really get away with this for so long.So one of the big issues here for the victims' families is that they believe that Netflix is exploiting this story. They allegedly were not contacted about the movie at large about the victims' statements. Now this is all public record, so Netflix didn't have to necessarily do that. But I think it speaks to the larger question that we as a society have, our fascination with serial killers. But should we be giving this as much attention? I just don't know. That's-- I'm not a philosopher. So I will not go deeper into that.DAVE BRIGGS: Nothing our about fascination with serial killers.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes.DAVE BRIGGS: Steering clear of that one. Did you see it?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I-- I'm a little scared to see this one.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm terrified.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I've heard it's very gruesome and very dark, so but again, the numbers speak for itself. And for a company like Netflix--DAVE BRIGGS: I would never sleep again.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly.DAVE BRIGGS: Allie Canal, good stuff. Thank you so much.]"

Here with the deeper dive, let's bring in Yahoo! Finance's Allie Garfinkle, who's been tracking all of the big names for us. Worth taking a step back to look at the damage right now?ALLIE GARFINKLE: Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. So we're at the end of a really ugly third quarter for tech, right? We're seeing some gains today, which is nice. But the year-to-date numbers, don't look great.I mean, one to pull out is Meta, right? Down 59% year-to-date. We're seeing hiring freezes yesterday. And their bottom line is also being roiled by Apple's privacy changes. So a lot going on over there.But the numbers across the board don't look good either, right? You have Google also announced some job cuts, down 32% this year-to-date. You have Snap, of course, which is one of the biggest losers we've seen so far, down about 78% year-to-date. So a lot of carnage there, right?Why? Now, why this is happening, right? Easy money is not so easy anymore. Consumer spending is slowing down. And companies have struggled to build and ship products amid a global supply chain crisis. So a lot of things going on, hitting all these-- hitting all these companies really hard.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, and then especially some of those social media companies you mentioned. There's the Apple privacy issue. But ad dollars slowing down in a big way, which is something we've heard from companies like Snap and Meta.So there's a lot of investors who are still putting money behind these companies, whether it's individual stocks or ETF funds. What should they be looking for to indicate some upside?ALLIE GARFINKLE: Yeah it's a great-- it's a great question, Akiko. I mean, the thing I'm hearing from analysts is proceed with caution, number one. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, actually was on the show earlier this week, saying, it was the most pessimistic he'd been about the sector since 2009. So that's number one.Story continuesBut number two, also, there is hope on the horizon, right? It's a holiday season coming up. A great holiday season could mean a lot for companies, like Apple and Amazon. So I think that's the thing to watch out for. See how everyone fares in the holiday season, watch earnings.AKIKO FUJITA: Well also, you know, we've heard from so many who have said, look, it really comes down to not ""growth at all costs,"" which is a shift we've already seen for many of these companies, but also, profitability. What are the numbers tell you? And we talk about tech as a whole, but really it is about piecing these names out that have better fundamentals than others.ALLIE GARFINKLE: Exactly. And I think we're going to see-- we're gonna know more at earnings. But I really do think that long term, people are still talking about this as a sector with a lot of opportunity. And I think-- and I think we kind of go from there.AKIKO FUJITA: All right, Allie Garfinkle, thanks so much for that.]"

(NASDAQ:AMGN) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 13x and even P/E's lower than 7x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.Recent times have been advantageous for Amgen as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Amgen peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Amgen will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Amgen would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 20% gain to the company's bottom line. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year EPS frustratingly shrank by 3.1% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.6% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.In light of this, it's understandable that Amgen's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.What We Can Learn From Amgen's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Amgen maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Before you settle on your opinion, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Amgen that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Amgen.

The work related to the deal will be performed in Annapolis, MD.Valued at $43 million, the contract is expected to be completed by August 2025. Per the contract, the company will provide lead yard support, and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia-class submarines. The deal was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Nations across the globe are increasingly augmenting their defense spending lately in a bid to strengthen their defense structure. The increased defense spending is mainly for upgrading and improvising the defense systems with technologically advanced features fueled by the rising geopolitical tensions. To this end, military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form integral parts of any nation’s defense system.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics, as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines, and has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy.In this regard, the business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering, and leads the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines. The company has 19 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2031. This results in a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon involving submarines. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Such a trend in demand is likely to bolster GD’s revenue-generation prospects from its Electric Boat business unit and may boost its overall top line.Looking AheadPer the report from Mordor Intelligence, the submarine market???is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% between 2022 and 2031. Such abounding growth trends indicate ample growth opportunities for General Dynamics, as it enjoys a lucrative position in the military submarines space.Story continuesA few defenseprimes, which can reap the multitude of gains from the expanding submarine market,are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines are the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines and can strike targets up to 621 Miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.The long-term earnings growth rate of BAESY is pegged at 9.3%. Shares of BAE Systems have rallied 17.8% in the past year.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. Northrop Grumman also provides launch systems for submarines. Its eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. NOC’s investors have gained 30.4% in the past year.Huntington Ingalls has a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build Virginia class fast attack nuclear submarines. Its division Newport News is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Huntington Ingalls’ 2022 earnings suggests a growth rate of 13.4% from the prior-year reported figure.

That is equivalent to burning about 630,000 pounds of coal every hour, GHGSat said in a statement.""This rate is very high, especially considering it's four days following the initial breach,"" the company said.The total amount of methane leaking from the Gazprom-led pipeline system may be higher than from a major leak that occurred in December from offshore oil and gas fields in Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which spilled around 100 metric tons of methane per hour, Caltagirone said.The Gulf of Mexico leak, also viewable from space, ultimately released around 40,000 metric tons of methane over 17 days, according to a study conducted by the Polytechnic University of Valencia and published in the journal Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters.That is the equivalent of burning 1.1 billion pounds of coal, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator.Improved satellite technology has rapidly enhanced the ability of scientists to find and analyze greenhouse gas emissions in recent years, something some governments hope will help companies detect and prevent methane emissions.Story continuesThe major leaks that suddenly erupted in the Nord Stream gas pipelines that run from Russia to Europe have generated plenty of theories but few clear answers about who or what caused the damage. Both Russia and the European Union have suggested the ruptures were caused by saboteurs.Europe and the United States have heaped sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, raising worries the Kremlin will seek to deprive Europe of crucial energy supplies leading into the winter.Caltagirone said, whatever the cause, the damage to the pipeline posed a problem beyond energy security. “This is the most wasteful way to generate emissions,” he said.(Writing by Richard Valdmanis Editing by Frances Kerry and Howard Goller)]"

BTC then retreated to a range between $19,500 and $20,000 in the subsequent hours but experienced a sudden sell-off right before the U.S. equity market close.Brainard reiterated the Federal Reserve’s commitment to taming inflation, even at the expense of a hard economic landing. “Inflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional inflationary shocks cannot be ruled out,” she said at an event in New York.Ether’s (ETH) price recently rose to about $1,340, a 0.4% gain from the same time the previous day. The trading volume of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down 2.3%. Its return on investment (ROI) has fallen 13% in the past 30 days as equity markets wrapped up the third quarter.The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, rose 0.76%.“It's been a very choppy week in bitcoin, which has failed to make a sustainable run in either direction despite attempts at both,” Oanda Senior Analyst Craig Erlam wrote in an email, although he noted that bitcoin seemed to be forming a floor “a little shy of the early summer lows around $17,500.”“I keep using the word resilience when discussing bitcoin and that has very much remained the case,” he wrote, adding: “Perhaps a period of stability is what it needs.”Economic calendarThe core personal consumption expenditure (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of U.S. inflation, was hotter than expected in August, rising 4.9% on a year-over-year basis after increasing 4.7% in July.Looking ahead, the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for September issued in the U.S. and the U.K. will be released on Monday. The indexes will offer the latest evidence of manufacturing activity in both countries and the direction of their economies, which now seem to point to a sharper economic slowdown than their central banks had been hoping.Story continuesU.S. equitiesU.S. equities slogged through a dreary day, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 (which has a heft technology component) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining 0.8%, 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index results for August, released Friday, spooked investors already fretting about high inflation.The PCE, which excludes energy costs, is a widely watched measure of price trends. Stocks have fallen steadily downward this year, with the DJIA this week becoming the latest index to fall into bear market territory, meaning it has fallen at least 20% from its previous high.CommoditiesGold ticked down a fraction of a percentage point, continuing a recent trend. The traditional safe-haven investment has been swept up with riskier assets and is trading at about $1,661, a more than 14% drop over the past six months.Brent crude oil, a widely watched measure of energy markets, was selling at about 85% per barrel, up slightly, although investors remain nervous about energy prices amid threatening remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the possible widening of Russian military aggression beyond Ukraine.Latest Prices● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,388 −0.1%● Ether (ETH): $1,334 +0.2%● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $964 +0.6%● S&amp;P 500 daily close: 3,585.62 −1.5%● Gold: $1,670 per troy ounce +0.7%● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.80% +0.06Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

QNT was recently trading at about $143, a roughly 27% increase over the past seven days.The price of QNT has surged over the past seven days. (CoinDesk).The increase comes as U.S. and foreign agencies wrestle with a vast array of cryptocurrency regulatory issues, including stablecoins and central bank digital currencies.Last week, as CoinDesk reported, U.S. House Democrats hashing out the details of this year's stablecoin regulation bill pushed for a provision directing the Federal Reserve to move forward on a digital dollar, but the negotiations settled instead on another Fed study. Even that compromise is on uncertain ground as the legislation hasn't yet been issued publicly.The draft of the House bill, which is now circulating among lawmakers and the industry, won’t yet represent the authorization Fed officials have said they are waiting for from Congress before they decide to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The federal government has been inching closer to such an approval, with the U.S. Treasury Department recommending in a recent report that work on a digital dollar should continue while the executive branch also comes to a decision.Noting Quant’s CDBC business, Crypto Finance AG sales trader David Scheuermann wrote in a note that “it's no secret that governments are pushing to crack down on current stablecoins, and exploring their own digital currencies, CBDCs.”He added: “These recent political developments have sparked rumors of central banks adopting Quant Network’s overledger technology for CBDC developments,” said Scheuermann.Altcoin RoundupCryptocurrencies XRP, MKR Shine as BTC, ETH Hold Steady Ahead of US Inflation Figure: Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP climbed above its 200-day moving average while maker (MKR) hit a three-week high.

Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre joins us with the details. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hi, Rachelle. That's right. And the Biden administration wants to limit fuel exports because what it's trying to do is increase the inventories of fuel in the East Coast. Well, the ExxonMobil sent a letter to the energy department. It was reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. And it was signed by Darren Woods, the CEO of ExxonMobil. And basically, what he's warning about is refineries in the Gulf Coast creating a glut there because this fuel would not really get to the East Coast.Basically, this glut would cause refineries to stop or to cut down on their output. Now, fuel exports are near record highs right now. And this is simply because of the energy crisis that's going on in Europe. We know that diesel, we know that heating oil will be in demand as the winter comes in. And this is really, though, a continuation of the push-pull between the energy industry and the Biden administration.Now, you do have gasoline prices that are at an average of $3.79 per gallon. Remember when they were above $5 per gallon back in June. Well, they have eased somewhat. And part of this, of course, is because of the price of oil. If we look at our YFi Interactive, WTI today down. But I'm going to pull up a quarter to date because this is significant. WTI down 23% quarter to date. You've got Brent crude that's down 18% quarter to date.This is because of recession fears. This is because of the lockdowns in China. And it's also because of the strong dollar. And you can expect to perhaps see oil rally somewhat next week if OPEC+ announces production cuts, guys.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Ines Ferre, thanks so much for that. Appreciate it. Enjoy the weekend as well.]"

There’s electric vehicle manufacturers, renewable energy providers, battery stocks, and a host of other service-related businesses tied to this sector. Within the electrification trend, I think a few battery sleeper stocks may be worth considering above all others.Battery technology has improved dramatically in recent years, thanks in part to global efforts to mitigate climate change. As battery technology improves, more facets of our daily lives can be electrified. Accordingly, various battery-related companies can provide the kind of sustainable long-term growth investors may be looking for.That said, not all battery stocks are the same. In fact, there are a wide range of companies to choose from. Here are three of the top battery sleeper stocks I think may be worth a look right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEENextEra Energy$81.80LACLithium Americas$26.80QSQuantumScape$9.32NextEra Energy (NEE)Conceptual image of a modern battery energy storage system with wind turbines and solar panel power plants in backgroundSource: petrmalinak / ShutterstockOne of the top battery sleeper stocks to consider is NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). This energy utility company is a mega-cap stock, with a market capitalization of around $160 billion. Thus, this is the big dog in many facets of energy transmission and production.NextEra produces a mix of renewable and non-renewable electricity. Among the business lines NextEra has focused on in terms of investment is its battery storage business. The company plans to own a significant amount of market share in the battery storage market, focusing on developing various battery technologies. One of the unique projects the company recently put into play is the world’s largest solar-powered battery.As the need for energy storage increases, NextEra stands ready to handle the burden. This is a company with solid fundamentals and impressive long-term growth prospects. For those looking for a mega-cap battery sleeper stock, this is certainly one to consider.Story continuesLithium Americas (LAC)a construction worker looks on as an excavator gets to work in a mineSource: ShutterstockA Canada-based battery-related stock to make the list is Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC). As its name suggests, Lithium Americas is engaged in the lithium mining business. For those bullish on the future of battery technology and battery storage, lithium is a key component to consider.Notably, battery sleeper stock Lithium Americas is among the few companies with mining rights in the U.S. The company’s Thatcher Pass mine in Nevada is the basis for the company’s massive reserves.For those concerned about the geopolitical situation right now, this company provides a serious defensive posture. As more battery production is on-shored, Lithium Americas stands to reap the benefits. Additionally, more lenient permitting and regulation from the government, along with strong investment interest from institutional and retail investors, makes this a top stock to consider for the long-term.With lithium, it’s also clear that demand will likely continue to increase over the long-term. Those looking for a true “picks and shovels” play on the battery space ought to consider LAC stock right now.QuantumScape (QS)A vector illustration of a battery with neon lines swirling it; forever batterySource: MarySan / Shutterstock A more speculative pick on this list is QuantumScape (NYSE:QS). Perhaps a battery sleeper stock to some, QuantumScape is a company that’s been making a number of headlines of late in the battery technology world.That’s because this company is focused on developing a commercial-scale solid-state battery. Most batteries use some sort of liquid electrolyte solution to pass electrons from the cathode to the anode in the battery. However, companies like QuantumScape are seeking to create a battery that doesn’t require this liquid solution. Doing so provides a denser battery, able to hold more charge and be much more efficient.The science is still out on how long it will take to bring these theoretically-possible batteries to scale. While QuantumScape has put forward a plan to commercialize its batteries by 2025, some short sellers aren’t buying it. Accordingly, this stock has been hit with a number of short attacks, which have depressed the companies value substantially.I have to admit, I’m skeptical as to whether QuantumScape can produce the batteries it says it can. Additionally, there’s concern that other competitors will beat the company to the punch. In either case, this is certainly more of a speculative bet.That said, for those who think this company may be a leader in the solid-state battery space, QS stock may be worth a look.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

(NYSE:TSN) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 15th of December, with investors receiving $0.46 per share. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 2.8%. View our latest analysis for Tyson Foods Tyson Foods' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Before making this announcement, Tyson Foods was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.EPS is set to fall by 22.5% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 25%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.historic-dividendTyson Foods Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.16 in 2012, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.84. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 28% over that duration. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Tyson Foods has been growing its earnings per share at 19% a year over the past five years. With a decent amount of growth and a low payout ratio, we think this bodes well for Tyson Foods' prospects of growing its dividend payments in the future.Tyson Foods Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Tyson Foods might even raise payments in the future. The company is generating plenty of cash, and the earnings also quite easily cover the distributions. However, it is worth noting that the earnings are expected to fall over the next year, which may not change the long term outlook, but could affect the dividend payment in the next 12 months. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Tyson Foods that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with T. Click here to check it out. V 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VPeter Lynch Chart of VEvery day, billions transactions use these companies' networks to process payments and, in the case of American Express, borrow money. This is not going to stop if the economy crashes. Transaction volumes might decline, and the total amount of spending through the network might also decline, but people still need to buy and sell essential items in an economic downturn. The economy will eventually recover, and these companies even have built-in inflation protection by taking a percentage of each transaction as revenue.Whats more, the general global shift away from cash towards digital payments over the past few decades was further accelerated by the pandemic, which should offset some of the declines in transaction volumes.But the question for investors is, is any one of these payments processing stocks offering better value than the others, or are they all the same? Let's take a look.Business differencesWhile these three companies are all extremely similar at their base, they also have major differences. I want to begin by pointing out that Visa and Mastercard are more similar to each other than to American Express.American Express is more like a bank because, in addition to operating a payments network, it also lends money to consumers on its credit cards. This means it is more exposed to the economic downturn because if customers run into financial difficulties, they are unlikely to be unable to repay their outstanding liabilities in full. This means American Express has more exposure to potential defaults and customer losses.Story continuesAnd we can see how this has influenced the market's opinion of the business. It is currently trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.5, compared to 21 for Visa and 24 for Mastercard.Due to the difference in business models, Visa and Mastercard are about twice as profitable as American Express, although the return on equity across the group is relatively similar.When it comes to balance sheet strength, both Visa and Mastercard have net cash balances compared to American Express complex balance sheet of assets and liabilities.Looking at these three companies, Visa and Mastercard appear to have the better operating performance, although American Express is significantly cheaper.The valuation cushion As American Express operates more like a bank than a fintech company, it is a bit more complex to understand. However, the stock is cheaper, and there is more of a valuation cushion here.At more than 20 times forward earnings, Visa and Mastercard still look expensive on some metrics, especially if we are heading into an economic downturn. If we see valuations suddenly plunge across the market, these companies are significantly more exposed than American Express.But that does not mean they will underperform in the long term. History shows that expensive companies can remain expensive as long as they continue to earn higher returns on equity and post market-beating growth.Another thing to note is the dividend yield on American Express shares. The stock currently supports a yield of 1.6%, compared to 0.9% for Visa and 0.7% for Mastercard.So the question of which stock is the better value in the current environment really depends on ones understanding of the financial sector and objectives. American Express is a more complex business, but the stock is cheaper. Visa and Mastercard are easier to understand. Still, they do command premium valuations. This may not hold up in an economic downturn, although over the next 20 years or so, this is unlikely to be an issue.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

In addition, such businesses boast impressive track records of delivering strong returns over the long term, including consistent and growing dividend payments.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn an environment where the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index has lost a quarter of its value year to date, the market now offers a range of undervalued blue-chip stocks. Clearly, some of these businesses have been unfairly punished by the jittery market sentiment.Put another way, the recent decline in valuations of some of the leading blue-chip stocks represents a compelling buying opportunity for patient, long-term investors. These stocks are primed to provide robust capital returns when market sentiment reverses.With that said, here are seven blue-chip sleeper stocks poised to gain traction in the coming months.AAPLApple$151.33BABoeing$ 125.95COSTCostco Wholesale$477.39GSGoldman Sachs$289.22MAMastercard $285.55MCDMcdonald’s$237.54MRKMerck$86.04Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $129.04 – $182.94With a market cap of $2.4 trillion, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has built an iconic brand focused on mobile communication and media devices. Apple claimed a 15.6% share of the global smartphone market in the second quarter of 2022.The tech giant reported Q3 results in late July, when revenue hit a record $83 billion, up 2% year over year. The iPhone segment has particularly seen considerable growth momentum boosted by 5G phone sales.Meanwhile, Apple’s high-margin service segment, which includes the App Store, Apple Music and Apple TV+, saw a double-digit year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching almost $20 billion.Story continuesThe company recently announced its plans to enter the “buy now, pay later” business which could provide lucrative returns as Apple Pay is already used by more than 500 million people worldwide.AAPL stock has lost more than 17% year to date. However, given its growth prospects, the shares have a historically reasonable valuation at 23.8 times forward earnings and 6.4 times sales.Wall Street’s 12-month median price forecast for Apple stands at $185. In the coming days, AAPL shares could dip below $150, offering a better entry point for long-term investors.Boeing (BA)image of a Boeing 737 max aircraftSource: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $113.02 – $233.94Aerospace and defense giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) generates revenue primarily from manufacturing commercial aircraft. When the pandemic brought the travel industry to its knees, Boeing’s operations also suffered.As a result, the aviation industry, which has been leading U.S. exports in the past decade, fell to the fourth spot. Therefore, given the economic importance of Boeing, Wall Street pays close attention to metrics from Boeing.The aircraft maker announced Q2 results in late July. Its Q2 revenue declined 2% year over year to $16.7 billion. Yet, investors were particularly pleased that Boeing generated a positive operating cash flow during the quarter, remaining on track to also deliver positive free cash flow for fiscal 2022.In early August, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cleared Boeing to resume deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner. Meanwhile, the demand for air travel is recovering faster than previously anticipated. For instance, in July, Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) ordered 100 737 MAX jets, the largest request of its kind in over a decade.So far in 2022, BA stock has fallen close to 40%. Despite a rebound in air travel, shares are still trading at a historically cheap valuation of 1.3 times sales.Analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for Boeing stands at $200. Readers could regard a further decline toward the $120 level as a possible entry level.Costco Wholesale (COST)Short-Term Profit Taking May Take a Bite out of the Costco Stock PriceSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $406.51 – $612.27Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is the fifth-largest retailer in the world, with around 840 membership warehouses. The company operates on a membership-only basis and allows customers to save money by purchasing goods in bulk. Close to a third of sales come from Costco’s private label.The wholesale giant released Q4 and full-year results on Sept. 22. Costco’s financial results were strong, but revealed considerable cost pressures. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased by 15% year over year to $72.1 billion.Meanwhile, comparable store sales surged more than 10% across the company, which indicates that Costco’s low prices are becoming increasingly attractive for customers in today’s inflationary environment.The membership fees Costco charges clients account for a significant portion of its overall profit. As customers consistently renew their memberships, Costco can deliver consistent profitability, even during a market downturn.COST stock has declined more than 15% since the beginning of the year. Shares are trading at 0.95 times sales.Wall Street’s 12-month median price forecast for COST stock is $565. In the case of further market volatility in October, Costco shares could decline toward $460, giving an opportune entry point for retail investors.Goldman Sachs (GS)In this photo illustration the Goldman Sachs Group (GS) logo displayed on a smartphone screen and a stock market graph in the backgroundSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $277.84- $426.16Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is one of the most prominent investment banks worldwide. In terms of revenue, it ranks number two behind JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM).The financial services giant issued Q2 metrics in mid-July. Its revenue went down by 23%, while net earnings plunged 48% year over year.The decline came primarily due to declines in investment banking activities. Macroeconomic headwinds also led to a significant decline in equity underwriting and acquisition activity. Yet, in Q2, global markets and the consumer and wealth management divisions generated higher revenues.Meanwhile, the bank has been building its consumer banking business. Increasingly, consumers have access to savings and loan accounts and credit card lending services. It is also introducing products in Europe.So far in 2022, GS stock has lost 26%, and the dividend yield currently stands at 3.3%. Shares are available at a bargain valuation of 7.6 times forward earnings and just 1 times book value.Analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for GS stock stands at $376.50. We’d look to enter Goldman Sachs at around $290.Mastercard (MA)A close-up shot of Mastercard credit or debit cards.Source: Alexander Yakimov / Shutterstock.com52-week range: $290.24 – $399.92Leading credit card provider Mastercard (NYSE:MA) operates a technology-focused payment network. Its credit card brands includes MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus.In the first half of 2022, card networks stateside generated over $67 billion in transaction. Of that amount, Visa (NYSE:V) enjoyed close to $45 billion in purchases, followed by Mastercard with around $18 billion.The credit card giant has significantly benefited from the secular shift to digital payments. Its diversified business model insulates Mastercard from the cyclical volatility in various sectors and makes it resilient to rising inflation.In late July, Mastercard reported solid Q2 financials. Net revenue grew 21% year over year to $5.5 billion despite the negative impact of discontinuing operations in Russia.MA stock is trading at 52-week lows and has dropped nearly 23% year to date. However, given its quality and high growth prospects, MA stock is not expensive at 23.2 times forward earnings.The 12-month median price forecast for Mastercard stock stands at $417. Investors who can weather the short-term volatility in the MA share price, are likely to benefit from the increase in revenues and net margins.McDonald’s (MCD)A McDonald's (MCD) burger box and fries rest on a flat surface.Source: 8th.creator / Shutterstock.com52-week range:$217.68 – $271.15 Mcdonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is the largest fast-food company in the world, with roughly 40,000 stores. The company continues to grow its global footprint via partnerships with independent local business owners.The fast food giant released Q2 financials in late July. Revenue fell 3% year over year to $5.72 billion due to currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, global comparable-store sales grew almost 10%, driven by strategic menu price increases and digital offerings.Analysts mostly concur the decline in revenue reflects the bumpy recovery of its global business. Readers should note that international growth has been restrained by the lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine.Yet, management recently highlighted its success in the drive-thru and mobile ordering spaces. They could be key competitive advantages to further fuel digital sales growth.So far in 2022, MCD stock has declined nearly 12%. The dividend aristocrat offers a 2.2% dividend yield at its current stock price. Shares are trading at 23.3 times trailing earnings and 7.8 times sales. Meanwhile, analysts’ 12-month median price forecast for MCD stock stands at $282.50. Merck (MRK)Source: Shutterstock52-week range: $71.50 – $95.72Pharma giant Merck (NYSE:MRK) offers health care solutions through prescription medicines, vaccines, and biological therapies. Its portfolio of blockbuster therapies includes the cancer drug Keytruda, which generated over $17 billion in 2021.Other drugs to note are the antiviral Covid-19 treatment Lagevrio, human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil, and diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet. In addition, Merck’s pipeline boasts more than 100 studies in late-stage clinical development.The healthcare play announced Q2 financials in late July. Merck’s revenue grew 28% year over year to $14.6 billion, primarily driven by Keytruda. In 2022, Keytruda is expected to surpass $20 billion in sales. As a result, management anticipates full-year 2022 global sales growth between 18% and 20% year over year.Meanwhile, the healthcare giant is looking to acquire Seagen, a growing cancer treatment company, for an estimated $37 billion. This acquisition could boost top-line growth for the pharma specialist.MRK stock has appreciated 12% year to date, and supports s a 3.2% dividend yield. Shares have an attractive valuation at 11.6 times forward earnings and 3.9 times sales.Wall Street’s 12-month median price forecast for Merck is $100. In the weeks ahead, a potential decline toward the $83 level would make MRK stock more attractive.On the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil, Ph.D., did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

After the stock price dropped 6.8% last week, the company's market value declined by US$9.2b, but insiders were able to mitigate their losses.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At QUALCOMMIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer of Qualcomm Technologies, James Thompson, sold US$1.8m worth of shares at a price of US$183 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$113. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.QUALCOMM insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. QUALCOMM insiders own about US$139m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About QUALCOMM Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded QUALCOMM shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of QUALCOMM insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we've found that QUALCOMM has 2 warning signs (1 is concerning!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

The house is sleek—a single story, three-bedroom concrete home with a deck, hot tub, small above-ground pool and a striking view of the desert. But to set the home apart from the 1,200 other rentals in the area, Seale, 25, and her fiancé decided against an in-ground pool, and chose a pickleball court instead.Most Read from BloombergMusk Revives $44 Billion Twitter Bid, Aiming to Avoid TrialTrump Says US Agency Packed Top-Secret Documents. These Emails Suggest Otherwise.Loretta Lynn, Coal Miner's Daughter And Country Queen, DiesStocks Take Breather After Furious Rally From Low: Markets WrapMar-a-Lago Documents Included Pardons, Emails, Legal Bills“Compared to putting in a pool it was extremely cheap because it’s a concrete slab they had to finish and put the lines on,” she said. “We really just wanted something we could use and make us stand out.”Seale’s property is one of almost 1,300 short-term rentals across Airbnb and Expedia Group Inc.’s Vrbo that mention pickleball in their listing title or description, according to industry data provider AirDNA. The number of citations has increased 32% from 2019.While the number of residences boasting pickleball courts is still small compared with the more than 8 million listings combined for Airbnb and Vrbo, having homes that will entice guests helps the companies compete with hotels. After two years of Covid lockdowns, the travel companies have been enjoying a boom in demand, with revenue in the second quarter topping analysts’ expectations. But shares of Airbnb and Expedia are down about 37% and 48%, respectively, this year as analysts expect travel to taper off toward the end of 2022 amid high inflation and an uncertain economic outlook. Property listings that mention pickleball are down about 200 this year, likely a reflection of softer demand for popular sites near mountain and lake getaways, AirDNA said.Story continuesPickleball—played with a plastic, hollow-ball and wide paddle—resembles a cross between tennis, badminton and ping-pong. Players can compete as singles or as doubles on a court or even a driveway marked with chalk. All that’s needed is a lightweight and inexpensive net and paddles, making the game easily accessible to most people. The popularity of the sport exploded recently, growing 39% over the last two years to 4.8 million players, according to a study from the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association, a global trade group for sports and fitness brands. Players in the 18-34 age range make up almost 29% of total players, but among serious pickleball enthusiasts, those who play eight times or more a year, almost a third are 65 or older.Read about how LeBron James is buying a stake in a new pro pickleball teamAdvertising pickleball perks can help short-term rental hosts get noticed amid a flood of new properties that have cropped up since the pandemic. Demand for homes has swelled as people take advantage of flexible work options. More guests are looking for stays of a month or more, and many are bringing their whole families in search of a space to combine work and leisure. The top amenities people are looking for include home offices, fast Wi-Fi, backyards and pet-friendly homes, according to Airbnb.The San Francisco-based company said it doesn’t track searches for pickleball, but does note that travelers say amenities are a top priority for a great trip, especially when guests are booking for longer stays. On a blog post for hosts, Airbnb advises: “Thoughtfully outfitting your space and adding popular amenities to your listing will help you stand out from the crowd.” One host on the site suggested that other hosts “write your listing to invite people who value and enjoy the same things you do.”That’s what Mike and Barbara Burch did. The Sedona, Arizona, residents converted a guest house on their property into an Airbnb listing and installed a pickleball court in September 2020 after playing at their church’s gym before the pandemic. It’s been a draw for reservations, and the couple, who describe themselves as “very active seniors,” finds new playing partners when their guests pick up the paddles.“I have many people who will say, ‘I saw you had a pickleball court and that’s what bought me to your site,’” Barbara Burch said. “We’ve taught a lot of people that have no physical ability at all.”Pickleball players in the US are concentrated on the coasts, with more than 1 million from Florida to Washington, D.C., and more than 750,000 players on the West Coast, according to the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association report. But tournaments happen all across the country, including one in Sacramento, California, at the end of September that offers a $40,000 prize. That means travelers could be looking for a pickleball-friendly place to stay while competing, or to stay in shape while on vacation. Saint George, Utah, has the most pickleball-related rental listings in the US, with more than 100, followed by the Florida cities of St. Petersburg, Panama City Beach and Naples, according to AirDNA.Like Lake Tahoe, and Joshua Tree, Arizona saw a boom in the popularity of short-term rentals during the pandemic, along with a hot housing market. The number of short-term listings in Phoenix increased 46% as of August compared with last year, according to AirDNA. While many people flocked to the sunny, dry destinations as an ideal place to weather the pandemic and work from home, not everyone wants to just lounge by the pool after a day of video calls or while on a family trip.“If you go to a place like Arizona you’re gonna lay at the pool,” said Sarah Bradford, a former vacation rental manager and self-described pickleball fanatic. “A family is tired of playing at the pool after an hour. You need activities; you’re on vacation.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMillions in Cryptocurrency Vanished as Agents Watched HelplesslyMusk Won’t Own Twitter Until the Shareholders Get PaidPfizer Needs to Prove It’s Ready to Move On From Covid-19Facebook Is the Only Game in Town for Digital Political AdsBig Tech’s Next Big Thing?

While radars have been in use since World War II for locating threats and targets, nowadays, they are being used for multiple purposes like ground surveillance, missile control, fire control, air traffic control, moving target indication, weapons location and vehicle search.Demand for military radar systems has expanded manifold in recent times, driven by factors like a rise in defense spending of emerging economies, an increase in regional tensions and inter-country conflicts that have boosted threats from missiles and aircraft.

We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Medtronic's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Medtronic How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:9.9% = US$5.2b ÷ US$53b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.10.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 9.9% ROEOn the face of it, Medtronic's ROE is not much to talk about. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, Medtronic has shown a meagre net income growth of 4.8% over the past five years. Remember, the company's ROE is not particularly great to begin with. So this could also be one of the reasons behind the company's low growth in earnings.Story continuesWe then compared Medtronic's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 19% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDT? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Medtronic Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Medtronic has a three-year median payout ratio of 67% (implying that it keeps only 33% of its profits), meaning that it pays out most of its profits to shareholders as dividends, and as a result, the company has seen low earnings growth.Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 42% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 15%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we would have a hard think before deciding on any investment action concerning Medtronic. As a result of its low ROE and lack of much reinvestment into the business, the company has seen a disappointing earnings growth rate. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

This change was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's 1.51% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 1.71%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.02%.Heading into today, shares of the fertilizer maker had lost 8.42% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's loss of 10.7% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.52% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Mosaic as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Mosaic is projected to report earnings of $3.68 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 172.59%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.21 billion, up 81.54% from the year-ago period.MOS's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $13.46 per share and revenue of $21.13 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +167.06% and +71.02%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Mosaic should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

It said it is ""is focused on meeting all regulatory requirements to certify the 737-7 and 737-10"" and argues it is safer to have one common 737 cockpit alerting system.The requirements were adopted as part of a certification reform bill passed after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people and led to the best-selling plane's 20-month grounding.Senator Roger Wicker proposed an amendment that would extend the deadline and said he is hoping it will be attached to a must-pass annual defense bill, people briefed on the matter said. It is not year clear if Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell and other key lawmakers agree. Wicker's office declined comment.Wicker filed his amendment on Thursday, the same day a harsh Sept. 19 FAA letter to Boeing became public.The FAA raised significant concerns Boeing would not be able to win certification this year and told Boeing it has not completed key work needed in order to certify the MAX 7.Lirio Liu, the FAA's executive director of aviation safety, in the letter said the agency had told Boeing to turn in all remaining System Safety Assessments (SSAs) by mid-September ""if the company intends to meet its project plan of completing certification work (and receiving FAA approval for the MAX 7) by December.""The FAA added, ""most concerning, however, is that Boeing has yet to provide an initial submittal for six of theoutstanding SSAs."" The FAA said the letter speaks for itself.Story continuesBoeing said in a Sept. 22 letter to the FAA that it was ""hard at work to complete"" required SSAs.It said 10 were under revision by Boeing to address FAA comments in preparation for resubmittal, and that the remaining 6 were in the final stages of preparation and review prior to submittal.On Sept. 15, Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun predicted the company would win approval for the smaller 737 MAX 7 this year.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

An optimistic 2022 earnings per share (EPS) outlook instills further confidence in the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCigna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.The stock has gained 38.5% in a year compared with the industry’s rally of 28.6%. Meanwhile, the Medical sector and the S&amp;P Index has declined 22% and 15.7%, respectively, in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreCI is well-poised for progress, as is evident from its impressive VGM Score of B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, with the score being a weighted combination of all three factors.Robust ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for CI’s 2022 earnings is pegged at $22.98 per share, indicating an increase of 12.3% from the year-earlier reading, while the same for revenues stands at $180.3 billion, implying a 3.6% improvement from the prior-year actuals.The consensus mark for 2023 earnings stands at $25.34 per share, suggesting growth of 10.3% from the year-ago reported figure, while the same for revenues stands at $189.1 billion, indicating a rise of 4.9% from the year-ago reported number.Stellar Surprise HistoryCI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 10.74%.Northbound Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 and 2023 earnings has been revised 1.3% and 0.5% upward, respectively, in the past 60 days.Upbeat EPS View for 2022This year, Cigna anticipates adjusted revenues to be at a minimum of $178 billion, implying growth of at least 2.2% from the 2021 reported figure.Adjusted EPS are forecast at a minimum of $22.90. The guidance suggests minimum growth of 11.9% from the 2021 reported figure.Business TailwindsRevenues of Cigna continue to benefit from the robust performances of its two well-positioned growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Solid contribution from these businesses backed CI to witness a 15% CAGR of adjusted EPS over the 2010-2021 period. For more than a decade, CI has maintained a track record of reporting average annual adjusted EPS growth, higher than the long-term target of 6-8%.Story continuesEvernorth devises flexible home delivery, virtual and in-person care, and specialty customer-centric solutions that can be customized to address the specific needs of clients. This health services arm of CI makes concerted efforts to extend new and cost-effective solutions, which its clients can easily incorporate into their health plans. In the ongoing month, Evernorth added five digital solutions on its clinical platform, Digital Health Formulary.Cigna continues to benefit from a well-performing Government business, which in turn, is driven by continuous product expansions, rising membership and new collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems. As of Jun 30, 2022, total medical customers of CI grew 5.2% year over year. An aging U.S. population is expected to place Cigna’s Medicare plans in solid demand during the days ahead.Considering the promising prospects of its growth platforms, Cigna intends to intensify its focus on the core units, thereby continually divesting non-health units. The deal to divest its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses to insurer Chubb CB — inked in October 2021 — was completed in less than a year.Additionally, the sell-off provided Cigna with net proceeds to comfortably undertake share repurchases. This seems in sync with management’s announcement to prioritize share buybacks over large-scale mergers or acquisitions this year.An adequate cash balance and robust cash-generating abilities will continue to empower Cigna in prudently deploying its capital not only through share repurchases but also by hiking dividends. The last raise was approved by CI’s board in February 2022. Its dividend yield of 1.6% is higher than the industry’s average of 1.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Medical space are Lantheus Holdings, Inc. LNTH and Assertio Holdings, Inc.

The increased defense spending is mainly for upgrading and improvising the defense systems with technologically advanced features fueled by the rising geopolitical tensions. To this end, military submarines with enhanced undersea warfare capabilities form integral parts of any nation’s defense system.In this context, it is imperative to mention that the increased focus on military submarines is likely to benefit General Dynamics, as its Electric Boat business unit is a prime contractor of submarines, and has established standards of excellence in the design, construction and lifecycle support of submarines for the U.S. Navy.In this regard, the business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering, and leads the construction of Virginia-class attack submarines.

Their shoes are on sale, and so, too, are their shares after plunging today following a disappointing earnings report after Thursday's close. They beat on the top and the bottom, but it's the inventory story, once again, continuing to rear its ugly head and the retail sector. Levels soaring 65% in North America, 44% overall.Their CEO, John Donahoe, saying, quote, ""We effectively have a few seasons landing in the marketplace at the same time."" Nike stock hit 12 plus percent on the day and down nearly 50% year to date. Collateral damage to other stocks include Under Armour down more than 5%, Adidas down 4 plus percent, Dick's also down 6%. Lulu also falling more than 5%.But Rachelle, back to Nike. They showed no drop, according to their CEO, and according to the report, in demand. You're telling me you're going to get Nike at 2020 levels, and it's not a good buy? Can't argue that this is a time-- again, there may be a little more pain to come, but in the long run, you're getting Nike with no drop in demand at 2020 prices.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's tough because, obviously, when you hear this tightness when it comes to what we're seeing with Nike, obviously, a beat on the top and the bottom. But this inventory, it's been, obviously, a common theme that we noticed because a lot of these retailers, they overbought when they were panicked about having enough inventory during the pandemic. And now they're stuck with all this extra inventory.So when you have Nike starting to mark things down, especially in apparel, you wonder what, then, that means for some of these other brands as well, who maybe don't have such strong brand loyalty. So they're in a tough spot here. I think Nike is trying to weather the storm, but I'm surprised to see its confidence was not this much, Seana.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I also think-- I mean, just looking at the Street's reaction, a number of banks still have buys on the stock, but they have lowered their price target as a result of today's drop. Morgan Stanley, Guggenheim, Stifel, RBC, all lowering their price target on the stock, citing those macroeconomic headwinds here over the coming quarters. But long-term, though, they do remain bullish on the stock.

Per the company, the disease affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States. Presently, there are no approved treatment options and no cure for ALS.The HEALY ALS study is an adaptive study evaluating multiple investigational treatments simultaneously for the easy and accelerated development of treatment options for ALS patients.Biohaven evaluated verdiperstat in the study participants with ALS for a period of 24 weeks. The candidate did not exhibit any statistically significant difference in the prescribed primary efficacy outcome, disease progression measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised or survival in patients who received the drug compared with a placebo. The candidate also did not exhibit any improvements in the key secondary efficacy measures of the study.The initial data from the safety analysis of the study was in line with the candidate’s previous studies.The company continues to conduct additional analyses of the candidate and expects to report results from the complete results at an upcoming scientific meeting.Shares of Biohaven have returned 9.9% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 24.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBiohaven is a commercial-stage biopharma company focused on developing and commercializing therapies for rare neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.Biohaven is also conducting a phase III study evaluating taldefgrobep alfa in Spinal Muscle Atrophy (SMA).

139,2754d163-f490-3025-a9b0-ec8b545c61a2,PFE,2022-10-01,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001631.html,1664543401,STORY,['PFE'],"[Strange but true: seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.The tried-and-true retirement investing approach of yesterday doesn't work today.For example, 10-year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6.50%, which translated to an income source you could count on. However, today's yield is much lower and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements.The effect of this drop in rates is substantial: over 20 years, the change in yield for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries is over $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksDividend-paying stocks from low-risk, high-quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace low risk, low yielding Treasury and bond options.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Going beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Story continuesHere are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.OFG Bancorp (OFG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.2 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.19%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.31% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.85%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 87.5%. Check OFG Bancorp (OFG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.62% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.78% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.15 per share, Retail Opportunity Investments (ROIC) has a dividend yield of 4.43%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry's yield of 4.95% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 18.18%. Check Retail Opportunity Investments (ROIC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're interested in investing in dividends, but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks, beware of fees. Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees, which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends, undercutting your dividend income strategy. Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach.Bottom LineSeeking steady, consistent income through dividends can be a smart option for financial security in retirement, whether you invest in mutual funds, ETFs, or in dividend-paying stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.Fox’s growing user base is not only driven by Fox News but also Fox Business, which drove 151 million multiplatform views as of last month. Fox Business surpassed CNN Business and Comcast’s CMCSA MSNBC in multiplatform views for the fifth straight month.Comcast’s MSNBC lost 19% of its prime-time viewers in the first half of 2022. Per Nielsen data, its ratings have plummeted ever since The Rachel Maddow show shifted to a once-per-week format from four times per week.Fox’s investment in Flutter has benefited its sports business division as well. Together they entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. The partnership offers the FOX Bet Super 6 national free-to-play game, which has generated a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022.Story continuesWhat Lies Ahead for Fox?Fox’s shares have declined 14.8% year to date compared with the Zacks Consumer &amp; Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.9%.However, Fox’s cable TV business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This cord-cutting does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. The EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox also faces competition for ad dollars, which forms its main source of revenue. This is intensified by offerings from tech giants like Meta Platform’s META Facebook, Twitter TWTR, Google, YouTube and Amazon, as they too have been fighting for ad dollars.Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram. Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.However, Fox, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), remains confident for fiscal 2023 as the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections and the start of its next major distribution cycle are expected to deliver record revenues and EBITDA.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors following this style of investing are usually not interested in betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 2%, the stock of this refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 18.3% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.7. This indicates that the stock moves 70% higher than the market in either direction.Story continuesGiven this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.In addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.31 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 31 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $1,599 million, suggesting a rise of 2.7% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has declined 22.7% in the past 30 days to 65 cents per share, indicating a decline of 18.8% from the figure reported in the prior-year fiscal quarter. The food company has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 1.2%, on average. MKC delivered a negative earnings surprise of 26.2% in the last reported quarter.Factors to ConsiderMcCormick &amp; Company continues benefiting from its product innovation, an important catalyst. Contributions from buyouts like FONA International (concluded in December 2020) and the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce (November 2020) have been working well for MKC. However, increased cost inflation and supply-chain disruptions are concerns.McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated QuotePreliminary Q3 Results &amp; GuidanceMcCormick &amp; Company recently stated that third-quarter 2022 sales lagged management’s expectations. While results were fueled by continued strength in the Flavor Solutions segment, the Consumer segment's growth was hampered by the divestiture of the Kitchen Basics business and earlier-than-expected moderation of increased consumption trends. Besides, inflation-led pressure on consumers’ cost of living induced greater-than-expected price elasticity.McCormick &amp; Company continued to encounter supply-chain hurdles during the fiscal third quarter, with supply recovery for some restricted materials taking a longer-than-anticipated time. Additionally, MKC continued to incur increased costs to cater to high demand in certain parts of the business and witnessed reduced operating leverage in other parts where demand was muted. Escalated supply-chain costs are putting pressure on MKC’s gross margin.Management lowered its guidance for fiscal 2022, considering the preliminary results for the fiscal third quarter, earlier-than-anticipated moderation of consumption trends, sluggish normalization of supply-chain cost, the impacts from the Kitchen Basics business divestiture (concluded during the fiscal third quarter) and increased currency headwinds. These aspects raise concerns over the quarter to be reported as well.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for McCormick &amp; Company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which isn’t the case here.McCormick &amp; Company Foods has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

K is expected to register top-line growth when it reports third-quarter 2022 numbers.

152,f082cf19-be51-34ca-9600-057906256a9c,PNC,2022-10-01,Regions Financial (RF) to Pay $191M for Illegal Overdraft Fees,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-pay-191m-143202943.html,1664548322,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC']","[Regions Financial Corp RF has been asked by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to pay $191 million in redressal and fines for levying illegal overdraft fees on customer accounts from 2018 to 2021.While the bank does not charge these fees anymore, it will have to pay a $50-million civil monetary penalty and refund customers around $141 million charged earlier. The financial impacts of the settlement will be reflected in RF’s third-quarter 2022 results.Management noted, “The CFPB settlement involves one type of overdraft fee that was previously charged when there was sufficient money in an account when a debit card or ATM transaction was authorized – but not when the transaction actually posted to the account, due to other transactions.”In 2019, Regions Financial initiated modifications in its overdraft process to offer customers effective tools for managing their daily cash flow and avoiding various fees. Also, this year, the company eliminated overdraft protection transfer fees and non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees.The company reduced caps on overdraft fees, launched an early direct deposit feature, making consumers’ paychecks available up to two days early, and introduced a low-cost line of credit to help customers meet short-term financial needs. The changes led to lower fees, declines in fee-related revenues and benefited consumers.Nonetheless, Regions Financial is focused on expanding and diversifying its business operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and inorganic activities. In December 2021, the company closed the acquisition of Clearsight to leverage the latter’s extensive technology sector knowledge in the M&amp;A advisory services space. As the company is committed to diversifying its revenue streams and meeting customer needs via diverse services, we believe that such endeavors will support its growth prospects in the long term.Over the past year, shares of RF have lost 8.6% compared with the 8.3% decline recorded by the industry.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, RF carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Several U.S. consumer banks have been asked to eliminate all consumer overdraft fees to safeguard customers. Amid this, banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC and BOK Financial BOKF have been undertaking actions to align with such requests.Earlier this month, BOKF announced that it would eliminate all NSF fees and reduce overdraft fees by the end of 2022. By the end of the year, BOKF will reduce the maximum number of overdraft fees charged per day from five to three and increase the overdraft cushion to $50 from $5.As part of its efforts to enhance the financial well-being of its customers, PNC announced that it would no longer charge its consumer deposit account customers NSF fees.Notably, PNC has been one of the first financial institutions to take a major step in addressing overdraft fees. In April 2021, the company launched Low Cash Mode, a cornerstone feature of its Virtual Wallet Spend account, which provides consumers with real options for avoiding overdrafts, while maintaining overdraft availability for those who need to make payments during temporary cash shortfalls.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The tree-trimming project will ensure better upkeep of trees, enhance electric service reliability and reduce the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages, especially during severe weather conditions.As part of the $33 million vegetation management program, Potomac Edison will cut trees along nearly 3,100 miles of distribution power lines in Maryland and West Virginia this year. Instead of sending ground crews to each facility, FE is deploying aerial saw services that are quicker and more effective in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week.Need for MaintenanceMaintaining vegetation along power lines is the first defense mechanism in preventing tree-related power outages. This ensures that transmission lines operate properly during extreme weather to efficiently transfer high-voltage power from generation units to designated locations.FirstEnergy is working steadily on maintaining its infrastructure. It employs tree contractors annually who work round the year to ensure proper vegetation management in the company’s electric lines. The aerial saw service used by FE cleanly cuts tree limbs 8-10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. This fast, secure and efficient method of tree-trimming reduced service interruption by 20% in 2021 compared with 2019.On Sep 14, 2022, FirstEnergy’s another unit, The Illuminating Company, completed the vegetation management of a complex $3 million tree-trimming project for nearly 100 power lines in the City of Cleveland. The project will enhance electric service reliability for more than 25,000 customers and provide greater flexibility to restore power outages during the upcoming winter storm season.Story continuesUtilities’ Focus on InfrastructureTo provide 24X7 electricity supply to consumers, utilities are investing heavily in strengthening their infrastructure. They are replacing old transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding distribution lines and going for technological upgrades to increase the resiliency of infrastructure for withstanding the impact of extreme weather conditions. Xcel Energy XEL, NiSource NI and Pinnacle West Capital PNW are some of the leading utilities.Xcel Energy continues to invest substantially in its utility assets and aims to strengthen and expand its transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects. XEL aims to spend $26 billion during the 2022-2026 period, which includes $1.5 to $2.5 billion in incremental opportunities.NiSource is working on a long-term utility infrastructure modernization program and made capital investments worth $1.9 billion in 2021. It plans to invest in the range of $2.4-$2.7 billion in 2022. NI estimated $40-billion long-term natural gas and electric infrastructure investment opportunities, which are expected to drive earnings beyond 2024.To efficiently serve its expanding customer base, Pinnacle West Capital has systematic investment plans to increase generation and strengthen its transmission and distribution lines. After investing $1.5 billion in 2021, it aims at investing $1.53 billion in 2022.  Pinnacle West Capital also plans to invest $4.7 billion during the 2022-2024 period.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, FirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Intuitive Japan will begin the product launch of SP in the near future.MHLW first cleared Intuitive’s multi-port system in 2009, and since then, Japan has added coverage for 29 robotic-assisted procedure types by public insurance, which will include procedures performed on SP.The da Vinci SP system provides surgeons with robotic-assisted technology designed for deep and narrow access to tissue in the body. The ability to enter the body through a single, small incision helps enable a minimally invasive experience for complex procedures.“Japanese surgeons have developed high expectations from Intuitive robotic systems, since the MHLW cleared our first multiport system in 2009,” said Gary Guthart, Intuitive CEO. “We are delighted to receive clearance for the single-port robotic system, which we believe will provide Japan’s surgeons with more opportunities to provide minimally invasive care.”The da Vinci SP system includes three, multi-jointed, wristed instruments and a fully wristed 3D HD camera. The instruments and the camera all emerge through a single cannula and are properly triangulated around the target anatomy at the distal tip to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces. The system enables flexible port placement and excellent internal and external range of motion (e.g., 360-degrees of anatomical access) through the single SP arm. Surgeons control the fully articulating instruments and the camera on the da Vinci SP system from a surgeon console.Story continues“The da Vinci SP is part of Intuitive’s fourth generation of products, and along with the da Vinci X and Xi multiport systems, allow us to offer our customers more options. We also hope that the introduction of the da Vinci SP will contribute to making minimally invasive robot-assisted surgeries more accessible to patients,” said Kazuhiro Takizawa, president of Intuitive Japan.In addition to Japan, the da Vinci SP system can be used in Korea for urologic surgery, general laparoscopic surgery, gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, general thoracoscopic surgery, and otolaryngologic surgery performed via an oral approach. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has cleared the da Vinci SP for urology and transoral otolaryngology procedures.About IntuitiveIntuitive (Nasdaq: ISRG), headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, is a global leader in minimally invasive care and the pioneer of robotic surgery.

Carnival's 2023 book position are only slightly above 2019 levels, and management now expects a slightly negative fourth quarter EBITDA, or another way of calling that would be operating profits.Not too surprised here, Brad, just given we have seen increased discounting on cruise lines. We have seen some pullbacks in various trips related to Hurricane Ian. That impacted more on the fourth quarter. But the economy is slowing down. And a lot of these cruises are booked six months to a year in advance. So if you've lost a job now, you're feeling concerned about your outlook, you're probably not spending thousands of dollars today to go book a cruise.BRAD SMITH: And for the cruise lines themselves, which would be highly kind of hinging on these re-engagement campaigns to really drum up even more fanfare among what is a very loyal consortium of the experience economy in cruisegoers, and I-- you're not going to put me on a cruise. Like, I just can't get into it.BRIAN SOZZI: No?BRAD SMITH: No, I'm not-- I don't do the deep sea stuff. But for the cruise line operators, it's been, OK, how do we increase the amounts that people are spending, even when they are on board the ships? And I think within that, you've got this micro economy that also needs to take place within that ship experience so that the cruise liners see higher fares that they're able to charge, even as they are trying to say, all right, yeah, we're charging a higher fare, but we're also going to throw a discount on top of that. So net, net, you'll be fine.However, they're going to look on the other side to get you to spend more when you're in that experience. And so this kind of has a twofold impact. If you're seeing them have to spend more in the marketing expenses, more money out the door there, and then hoping that a consumer that is saying, all right, yeah, for the entire family to be able to go on this cruise experience, we're going to need the promotion. And also, we're going to need to cut back on our spending while we're on the ship, too.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: I've got to try to convince you on the cruise. You go in there.BRAD SMITH: Can't.BRIAN SOZZI: You drop your bag in the room, Brad. You go to the bar. You lose track of time. You have no life. All you're doing is you're there. You take your drinks, you go to the hot tub. It's great. You can go to a concert at night. Oh, Brad.BRAD SMITH: No.BRIAN SOZZI: It's so good.BRAD SMITH: I need to see land.BRIAN SOZZI: Would you take a cruise first or get on Amazon Prime first?BRAD SMITH: Ah. Ooh, that's tough.BRIAN SOZZI: We'll take that out.BRAD SMITH: That's tough, yeah.BRIAN SOZZI: We'll take that the other side of the break.]"

Thankfully, investors who plan to own stocks for years to come don’t need to pinpoint an exact bottom and should instead consider slowly starting positions in blue-chip stocks with great fundamentals that should look like steals at these levels down the road.  The S&amp;P 500 is trading at new 2022 lows, with it at levels last seen in late November of 2020. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq is down over 6% in the past two years to trade where it was in the summer of 2020. The market could continue to slide. But investors should take solace in the fact that higher interest rates and soaring inflation are already showing up in corporate earnings outlooks.Wall Street had been waiting for the current economic turmoil to take its toll on sales and, more importantly, earnings before they consider nibbling at stocks again. With the heart of Q3 earnings season set to begin in the middle of October and September’s CPI data due out on Oct. 13, the market might not have to wait too much longer for an even clearer picture.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings and interest rates drive stock prices and the more clarity Wall Street gains on those fronts, the better. The outlook for Q3 FY22 earnings and full-year fiscal 2023 have already dropped significantly and the 10-year and two-year Treasury yields are responding to the Fed’s rate hikes and projected course of action.The major money managers are rather good at pricing in the future into stock prices, which is part of the reason why Wall Street is often ahead of Main Street, as we saw during the covid comeback and the subsequent beating growth and tech stocks started to take in late 2021 as investors realized the Fed would have to raise rates to cool the economy.The best investors use bear markets and major periods of panic to start positions in their favorite stocks. Just remember the average investor is often the most bullish to buy stocks near what turns out to be the tops and terrified to buy, with a penchant to panic sell, at what might one day turn out to be near the lows. Story continuesLet’s explore two great large-cap technology stocks for investors to consider buying in October at levels that might look like bargains in the not-too-distant future.Adobe Inc. ADBE Adobe might be the best of the rest when it comes to big tech. Though it is not in the same rarefied air as Apple and Microsoft, Adobe is a champion of a vital segment of the software market with an impressive subscription-based business model that’s helped it post between 15% to 25% revenue growth for seven-straight years. That kind of growth is highly impressive for a company that went public in the mid-1980s.Adobe’s portfolio of subscription software includes Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and many others for a total of nearly 30 rather unique offerings. Its products help users, from Hollywood filmmakers to students, edit videos and images, create artwork and books, and do almost anything else in the larger creative/design world that one might imagine can be done on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAdobe’s documents and business portfolio ranges broadly from PDFs and e-signatures to marketing, commerce, and workflow digitalization. And it’s prepared to expand its reach through its planned, roughly $20 billion cash and stock deal to buy privately held software firm Figma. The little-known company specializes in helping digital creators collaborate through shared software. Figma’s offerings should integrate well into Adobe’s portfolio and provide real benefits in a world where work gets done on individual computers even when people are in the same office.Wall Street is worried that Adobe is overpaying for Figma and sold the stock heavily when it announced the deal alongside its Q3 earnings release on Sept. 15. It is possible ADBE is paying too much at a time when growth-focused tech valuations have been crushed. But it’s difficult to argue with Adobe’s track record and its outlook in an increasingly crowded software market.The post-announcement drop helps set up a potentially attractive entry point for patient investors, with ADBE shares down roughly 30%. The recent decline is part of a larger recalibration of Adobe and other growth names to account for higher interest rates. ADBE stock has fallen 60% from its peaks to below its covid-lows.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchADBE’s falling price, coupled with its strong earnings outlook, has it trading where it was before it changed to a subscription model roughly a decade ago at 22.3X forward earnings. Plus, ADBE’s earnings estimates have largely held up in the face of the economic slowdown causing Micron and many others to dramatically lower their guidance.Adobe’s revenue is projected to jump 12% in 2022 and another 13% in 2023 to hit nearly $20 billion to help lift its adjusted EPS by 9% and 14%, respectively. ADBE currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), alongside “A” grades for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system.Analog Devices, Inc. ADI Semiconductor maker Analog Devices expanded its reach to help it challenge the biggest player in the analog space, Texas Instruments TXN, when it completed its acquisition of Maxim Integrated in August 2021. Analog semiconductors are on the less flashy side of the booming chip industry that will remain the backbone of technology and arguably the entire economy for the foreseeable future.  Analog semiconductors play crucial roles in countless devices and industries that next-generation digital semiconductors cannot meet. Analog chips help handle information not easily understood with 1s and 0s, such as temperature, speed, sound, electrical currents, and much more.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalog Devices boasts around 125K customers globally for its over 75K products, which helps provide diversification in a time of economic uncertainty, which is hitting the cyclical chip sector particularly hard. ADI executives project the firm will benefit from continued expansion within six secular growth segments, from connectivity &amp; data centers and digital healthcare to industrial 4.0 and automotive ecosystems.Analog Devices’ revenue and adjusted earnings both climbed by roughly 31% in fiscal 2021, driven in part by its Maxim Integrated deal. Current Zacks estimates call for ADI’s revenue to climb another 63% in FY22 to help lift its adjusted earnings by 46%. ADI is expected to grow both its top and bottom lines next year as well, even as it comes up again difficult to compete against periods.ADI shares have held up far better than its Zacks Semiconductor industry, down 17% in the past 12 months vs. 32%. ADI trades around where it was in December 2020 at roughly $140 per share. And its current Zacks consensus price target offers 38% upside to its closing levels Friday. Analog Devices is now trading right near its decade-long lows at 14.9X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarlier this year, Analog Devices lifted its dividend by 10% for its 19th raise in the last 18 years. ADI’s dividend yields 2.2% right now to top many of its peers and the S&amp;P 500’s 1.7%. The company boasts a solid history of stock buybacks, supported by a solid balance sheet. On top of that, 11 of the 16 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buy,” with nothing below a “Hold.” And now might be a solid time to add this chip stock that’s holding up somewhat well as semiconductor names tumble.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom AVGO, Analog Devices ADI, NetApp NTAP and Amdocs Ltd. DOX.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Dividend-Paying Stocks to Watch in the Tech SectorThe broader equity market has had a terrible run so far this year. The major stock indexes, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500, have fallen 18.3%, 29.4% and 22%, respectively, year to date (YTD).The equity market has been hammered by recession fears, inflationary pressure and soaring interest rates. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about the global economic recovery.Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 28% of its value YTD.Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. In July 2022, Gartner lowered its forecast for worldwide IT spending growth rate to 3% from 4% mentioned earlier. The research firm's report highlights that 2022 IT spending growth will be much slower than 2021 due to spending cutbacks across devices, software, IT services and communication services areas.Additionally, the sector is suffering from inflationary pressure, higher wages and currency fluctuations. Supply-chain disruptions due to an acute shortage of chips and several other components are affecting the profitability of the companies in the space.Story continuesThe aforementioned challenges are likely to persist in the near term, thereby negatively impacting the overall financial performances of the majority of tech stocks. We believe that investing in high-quality dividend-paying tech stocks like — Broadcom, Analog Devices, NetApp and Amdocs Ltd.— amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might fetch handsome returns.A stock with a history of increasing dividends is considered healthy and offers a capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of stock market movements. Dividend growth stocks generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and offer downside protection with a consistent increase in payouts.Watch These Dividend-Paying Tech StocksWe ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify stocks that have a dividend yield in excess of 2% with five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%. Furthermore, we have narrowed down our search by considering stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a dividend payout ratio of less than 60%.

""I had a chip on my shoulder that came out in destructive ways.""Witherspoon's path of destruction led to trouble with drugs, the abandonment of a Division 1 football scholarship at Bowling Green State University (his father's alma mater), and an assault charge during a stint in the Navy that threatened to put Witherspoon away.""We just want to do what we do well and help people understand what their potential is.""Larry Witherspoon""By the grace of God, the charge just disappeared and gave me a new lease on life,"" Witherspoon said. ""I knew if I was going to continue down that path, I was going to end up in jail or dead. I wanted to make a change and live a life of positivity and leave all that behind me.""Witherspoon went back to college, got his degree, and eventually moved to South Atlanta, where he kept meeting neighbors who reminded him of his younger self. It awakened a part him that he had resented and resisted-the legacy of his dad.""This feeling of what my father had done for young people really came up for me,"" Witherspoon said. ""I was like, ‘I have to do something here to make a change.'""Witherspoon discovered his neighbor, Shawn McHargue, shared that dream. In 2014, Witherspoon and McHargue founded Automotive Training Center (ATC), a nonprofit that provides young men and women the technical training needed to obtain employment in the automotive repair industry. ATC students work on real customer vehicles and are guaranteed employment at one of more than 20 transportation and automotive industry partners across Atlanta.Story continuesMore than 200 students have graduated from ATC in the past eight years.Beyond his pride in those results, Witherspoon is proud that his father became the model for his life's work.""In addition to being a high school principal, my dad coached multiple high school sports and worked part-time at a youth detention center,"" Witherspoon recounted. ""I grew up with that mark on me. I just didn't know it at the time.""We just want to do what we do well and help people understand what their potential is. It may not even be in automotive. You can come here; you can learn to solve complex problems. You can use that in any area of your life.""Automotive Training Center is changing lives, and Regions Bank and the Regions Foundation are supporting ATC's mission. Together, the bank and foundation have contributed toward ATC's training programs and a capital campaign for an expanded facility to serve more students.

The financial impacts of the settlement will be reflected in RF’s third-quarter 2022 results.Management noted, “The CFPB settlement involves one type of overdraft fee that was previously charged when there was sufficient money in an account when a debit card or ATM transaction was authorized – but not when the transaction actually posted to the account, due to other transactions.”In 2019, Regions Financial initiated modifications in its overdraft process to offer customers effective tools for managing their daily cash flow and avoiding various fees. Also, this year, the company eliminated overdraft protection transfer fees and non-sufficient fund (NSF) fees.The company reduced caps on overdraft fees, launched an early direct deposit feature, making consumers’ paychecks available up to two days early, and introduced a low-cost line of credit to help customers meet short-term financial needs. The changes led to lower fees, declines in fee-related revenues and benefited consumers.Nonetheless, Regions Financial is focused on expanding and diversifying its business operations on the back of investments in varied product offerings and inorganic activities. In December 2021, the company closed the acquisition of Clearsight to leverage the latter’s extensive technology sector knowledge in the M&amp;A advisory services space. As the company is committed to diversifying its revenue streams and meeting customer needs via diverse services, we believe that such endeavors will support its growth prospects in the long term.Over the past year, shares of RF have lost 8.6% compared with the 8.3% decline recorded by the industry.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, RF carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Several U.S. consumer banks have been asked to eliminate all consumer overdraft fees to safeguard customers. Amid this, banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC and BOK Financial BOKF have been undertaking actions to align with such requests.Earlier this month, BOKF announced that it would eliminate all NSF fees and reduce overdraft fees by the end of 2022. By the end of the year, BOKF will reduce the maximum number of overdraft fees charged per day from five to three and increase the overdraft cushion to $50 from $5.As part of its efforts to enhance the financial well-being of its customers, PNC announced that it would no longer charge its consumer deposit account customers NSF fees.Notably, PNC has been one of the first financial institutions to take a major step in addressing overdraft fees. In April 2021, the company launched Low Cash Mode, a cornerstone feature of its Virtual Wallet Spend account, which provides consumers with real options for avoiding overdrafts, while maintaining overdraft availability for those who need to make payments during temporary cash shortfalls.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Regions Financial (RF) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.61 a share, just 21 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 21, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.61 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.60 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Regions Financial has an Earnings ESP of 1.82%.RF is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is East West Bancorp (EWBC).East West Bancorp, which is readying to report earnings on October 20, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $2.15 a share, and EWBC is 20 days out from its next earnings report.For East West Bancorp, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 is 2.79%.Story continuesRF and EWBC's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

171,0b739fd6-5e99-38b3-b2f7-841ef781ce91,RF,2022-10-01,Barclays (BCS) Fined $361M by SEC for Securities Selling Gaffe,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barclays-bcs-fined-361m-sec-123812124.html,1664541492,STORY,"['BARC.L', 'BCS', 'RF-PC']","[Almost a week after being sued by the two Florida pension funds, Barclays BCS has agreed to pay $361 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). It was fined over the failure to maintain control that led to the sale of an extra $17.7 billion of exchange-traded notes (ETNs), which it was not permitted to issue.Of the total amount, $200 million is civil penalty and the remaining is disgorgement and prejudgment interest charges. BCS has neither accepted nor denied the SEC’s findings that it had failed to implement any internal checks to track such transactions on a real-time basis.Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, said, “While we acknowledge Barclays' efforts to identify, disclose and remediate this conduct, the control deficiencies and the scope of the conduct at issue here was simply staggering.”In July, the company CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan commented, “The fact that this overissuance matter occurred in the first place is particularly disappointing,” while noting that the bank “will try ceaselessly to improve” to prevent future mistakes.Notably, the company restated its full-year 2021 financial statements due to “the over-issuances and internal control failure.”Case BackgroundThe blunder originated from a prior enforcement settlement that BCS had agreed to with the SEC in 2017. Under this, the company lost its status as a well-known seasoned issuer (WKSI), which allowed it to sell notes in the United States with “flexible filing requirements.”Hence, the company had to quantify the number of securities it expected to offer, and sell and pay registration fees for those securities in advance. In August 2017, BCS agreed to offer and sell roughly $20.8 million ETNs for a period of three years.As a result of this requirement, the company employees knew that additional monitoring of the actual offer and sale of ETNs were needed on a real-time basis. However, BCS failed to establish a process for doing so. Hence, when in March 2022, it was realized that extra ETNs had been issued, the SEC was alerted, and the company stopped the further issuance of securities.BCS had issued almost 75% more ETNs than it was permitted to.Story continuesFollow-up Actions by BarclaysSubsequent to this blunder, Barclays has been taking certain remedial measures and offered to buy back the excess securities at the original purchase price and pay interest penalties. In this regard, the company on Sep 15 noted that investors had submitted claims covering $7 billion of the securities.Additionally, the company put aside nearly £1.6 billion for the over-issuance. This dented its second-quarter 2022 results.Over the past year, shares of BCS have lost 37.9% compared with a 17.1% decline of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Barclays carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The financial impact of the settlement will be reflected in RF’s third-quarter 2022 results.A unit of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK was charged with a record fine and a reprimand by the Central Bank of Ireland. The company broke the rules on outsourcing fund administration services and provided “inaccurate and incomplete information” to the regulators.BNY Mellon Fund Services DAC admitted to the breaches, which took place between July 2013 and December 2019. It was fined €10.78 million ($11.8 million) for 16 regulatory breaches. The penalty was reduced from €15.4 million as the company decided to settle.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with T. Click here to check it out. V 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VPeter Lynch Chart of VEvery day, billions transactions use these companies' networks to process payments and, in the case of American Express, borrow money. This is not going to stop if the economy crashes. Transaction volumes might decline, and the total amount of spending through the network might also decline, but people still need to buy and sell essential items in an economic downturn. The economy will eventually recover, and these companies even have built-in inflation protection by taking a percentage of each transaction as revenue.Whats more, the general global shift away from cash towards digital payments over the past few decades was further accelerated by the pandemic, which should offset some of the declines in transaction volumes.But the question for investors is, is any one of these payments processing stocks offering better value than the others, or are they all the same? Let's take a look.Business differencesWhile these three companies are all extremely similar at their base, they also have major differences. I want to begin by pointing out that Visa and Mastercard are more similar to each other than to American Express.American Express is more like a bank because, in addition to operating a payments network, it also lends money to consumers on its credit cards. This means it is more exposed to the economic downturn because if customers run into financial difficulties, they are unlikely to be unable to repay their outstanding liabilities in full. This means American Express has more exposure to potential defaults and customer losses.Story continuesAnd we can see how this has influenced the market's opinion of the business. It is currently trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.5, compared to 21 for Visa and 24 for Mastercard.Due to the difference in business models, Visa and Mastercard are about twice as profitable as American Express, although the return on equity across the group is relatively similar.When it comes to balance sheet strength, both Visa and Mastercard have net cash balances compared to American Express complex balance sheet of assets and liabilities.Looking at these three companies, Visa and Mastercard appear to have the better operating performance, although American Express is significantly cheaper.The valuation cushion As American Express operates more like a bank than a fintech company, it is a bit more complex to understand. However, the stock is cheaper, and there is more of a valuation cushion here.At more than 20 times forward earnings, Visa and Mastercard still look expensive on some metrics, especially if we are heading into an economic downturn. If we see valuations suddenly plunge across the market, these companies are significantly more exposed than American Express.But that does not mean they will underperform in the long term. History shows that expensive companies can remain expensive as long as they continue to earn higher returns on equity and post market-beating growth.Another thing to note is the dividend yield on American Express shares. The stock currently supports a yield of 1.6%, compared to 0.9% for Visa and 0.7% for Mastercard.So the question of which stock is the better value in the current environment really depends on ones understanding of the financial sector and objectives. American Express is a more complex business, but the stock is cheaper. Visa and Mastercard are easier to understand. Still, they do command premium valuations. This may not hold up in an economic downturn, although over the next 20 years or so, this is unlikely to be an issue.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Amphenol (APH) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of fiber-optic products a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Amphenol is 9.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 17.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amphenol is 33.2%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 9.7%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.4%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Amphenol have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 3.5% over the past month.Bottom LineAmphenol has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Amphenol is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a bear market for both stocks and bonds, they nonetheless have passed the $3 billion mark in total. The ETFs are laid out in the table below: TickerFundAUMExpense RatioSegmentCGGR Capital Group Growth ETF $727.11M 0.39% Equity: Global - Total Market CGDV Capital Group Dividend Value ETF $716.85M 0.33% Equity: U.S. - Total Market CGGO Capital Group Global Growth Equity ETF $505.30M 0.47% Equity: Global - Total Market CGXU Capital Group International Focus Equity ETF $462.34M 0.54% Equity: Global Ex-U.S. - Total Market CGUS Capital Group Core Equity ETF $323.78M 0.33% Equity: U.S. - Total Market CGCP Capital Group Core Plus Income ETF $286.23M 0.34% Fixed Income: U.S. - Broad Market, Broad-based  Five are equity funds, while the last is fixed income. I haven’t been kind to new ETFs such as single-stock ETFs and levered inverse ETFs. But these are different.Capital Group has been serving investors since 1931, and its American Funds is one of the nation’s oldest mutual fund families. For most of its history, they were distributed through investment advisors, often with 12b-1 loads. While they were relatively tax efficient, the ETF structure should allow even more tax efficiency due to the creation and redemption process. Indeed, Morningstar gives all six funds its’ highest “gold” forward ratings. I spoke with Holly Framsted, director of ETFs at Capital Group. She explained that these new ETFs weren’t branded under the American Funds name, as they’re not clones of any American Funds. Though the funds can be bought directly without an advisor, Framsted noted Capital Group believes investors are best served working through advisors. Story continues“These are actively managed strategies, and the number of holdings can and will vary. Currently our equity ETFs hold around 50-125 holdings each,” she explained.Framsted told me the expense ratios were in the lowest quartile of ETFs, before clarifying that this was relative only to active ETFs. Although the fees are lower than many, they’re still higher than broader total stock ETFs such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) and the iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT), which both have expense ratios of 0.03%.I turned to Elisabeth Kashner, FactSet Research Systems’ director of global fund analytics for her thoughts. CGGR and CGGO are cost leaders among their actively managed competitors, she said, and CGXU has just one lower-priced active rival. These ETFs have three to five rival active ETFs in their respective segments. Plenty of room is available in these markets for lower-cost active ETFs. However, CGDV and CGUS are not particularly competitive. DFA, Vanguard and American Century have undercut Capital Group here. “We will know more in a few months, when asset managers announce capital gains distributions. But given this year's equity market losses, we might not get all that much info this time around,” Kashner said with regard to the funds’ potential tax efficiency.My ViewThe Capital Group equity ETFs hold promise. I’d avoid the fixed income ETF as CGCP holds nearly 17% of its assets in either below BBB or nonrated debt. A better-known name for below investment grade is “junk.”For many years, American Funds had index-besting performance, and even today, their largest funds have relatively good long-term performance versus the appropriate indexes. A dozen years ago, I wrote a piece noting the magic wasn’t gone at American Funds. That said, I wasn’t close to buying loaded funds with less tax efficiency.While I suspect part of the reason for the entry into the ETF space was due to the American Funds’ negative fund flows over the past decade, the absence of loads and the increased tax efficiency make Capital Group’s ETF lineup worth another look. And Framsted is correct when she states American-gained market share in the active space. Active fund market share has declined significantly over the past few decades, so they are getting a bigger share of a smaller part of the fund universe. Unlikely to RecommendThat said, my mantra that investing is simply “minimizing expenses and emotions; maximizing diversification and discipline” makes it unlikely for me to buy or recommend these ETFs to clients. While an ETF with 100 stocks may be diversified—and the Capital Group equity ETFs have between 50 and 130 components—that doesn’t approach the more than 4,000 securities held within an ETF like VTI for a 0.03% annual expense ratio. “Capital Group's ETFs may be less costly or less concentrated than some of their rivals, especially in market segments where only a handful of actively managed ETFs compete. But they are still far pricier and far more concentrated than the most efficient ETFs in their market segments, which offer broad-based, cap-weighted, highly tax-efficient portfolios at ultra-low costs,” Kashner said, and I agree. But for those wanting a disciplined active manager with low costs relative to other active funds, these five Capital Group ETFs are worth a look. In fact, if I were to buy an active equity fund, I would buy one of these. Allan Roth is the founder of Wealth Logic LLC, an hourly based financial planning firm.

179,6d8b433c-af75-3f49-99a0-c0d56b1b8e9f,KLAC,2022-10-01,Be Sure To Check Out KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-kla-corporation-nasdaq-100224903.html,1660039344,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) is about to go ex-dividend in just two days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Thus, you can purchase KLA's shares before the 12th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 1st of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$4.20 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, KLA has a trailing yield of approximately 1.1% on its current stock price of $387.68. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for KLA If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. KLA is paying out just 19% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Luckily it paid out just 21% of its free cash flow last year.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see KLA's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 32% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, KLA looks like a promising growth company.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. KLA has delivered 12% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.Final TakeawayFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid KLA? KLA has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. There's a lot to like about KLA, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while KLA looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Our analysis shows 2 warning signs for KLA that we strongly recommend you have a look at before investing in the company.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The company’s market cap plunged by US$9.4b after price dropped by 3.0% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NVIDIAIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Mark Stevens, sold US$51m worth of shares at a price of US$186 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$121).

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 1.71%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.02%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had lost 12.32% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 11.76% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 9.52% in that time.Nvidia will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Nvidia is projected to report earnings of $0.74 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 36.75%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.99 billion, down 15.73% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $3.50 per share and revenue of $27.46 billion, which would represent changes of -21.17% and +2.03%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

So let's take a look at some of the biggest movers over the past 30 days, kicking it off with FedEx. Now the packaging giant was one of the biggest stories of the month, if not the biggest story of the month, withdrawing its forecast, issuing a bleak warning about the global economy. That spooked investors. Shares sold off, giving back two years of gains. FedEx suffered its worst one-day loss in over 40 years, plunging 21%.Morgan Stanley slashing its price target in half as a result. Citi saying it doesn't think management was successful in convincing investors that it has a credible plan that it can execute on. You can see that reflected in the one-month chart, with shares still off almost 30%, closing the month of September at 148.47.Let's take a look at the chipmakers. Intel, Nvidia, and AMD, some of these stocks being hit very hard during the month, among the worst performers in the NASDAQ. News that the government is restricting sales of some of Nvidia's chips to China has weighed on the chipmaker, also its competitors. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger saying at a conference this month that the environment is, quote, ""rough,"" and business may be, quote, ""worse."" Susquehanna cutting its price target on all three of these names.Taking a look, at least today, Intel, Nvidia, and AMD closing the day lower. But for the month, if you take a look at some of these one-month charts here, Intel closing the month of September, off just around 19%, Nvidia off 19 and 1/2%, AMD the worst performer of the three, off 25%, closing the month at 63.36.All right, let's take a look and round it out on an upbeat note. Biogen was a top performer in the S&amp;P in September. It was all about the news that we got earlier this week. Shares surged on the promising trial results from its Alzheimer's drug, which it said slowed the disease's progression. Now shares surged 40% on Wednesday, the stock's biggest gain since November 2020.Taking a look at just a one-week chart to really show you the action that we've seen in this name, you can see that spike shortly after the news was released, closing the month at 200-- or 267 bucks a share flat. Over the past month, certainly been a strong performance here for the stock. Shares up 36%. Year to date, though, up 11%. So we haven't really seen that performance, all of it, really, in the past week or so.]"

""I think we will be in a position to say more about that relatively soon.""Reuters reported earlier this month that the U.S. Commerce is preparing curbs on exporting AI chips that could be released as soon as October.The news on Sept. 1 that the chip companies had received letters caused Nvidia's stock to fall after the company disclosed the letters could affect as much as $400 million in revenue in its current fiscal quarter.American officials did not spell out how the new restrictions might be written.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said earlier this month that the letters spelled out curbs on chips with a combination of a chip's performance and its ability to connect to other chips to move large amounts of data around a data center quickly, criteria that affected only a small number of Nvidia's products.In his remarks on Friday, Chabbra confirmed that the restrictions affect only the most advanced chips and are ""structured as a combination of computing power but also interconnect speed.""(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Frances Kerry)]"

However, weakness in the Blood center franchise significantly affected Haemonetics’ results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past six months, Haemonetics has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 13.8% against the industry's 51.5% fall. Haemonetics exited the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues.The robust performance of the Hospital business, on continued strength in the Hemostasis Management product line, instills optimism. Robust contributions from the Vascular Closure business also seem promising. The expansion of both margins is an added advantage. The company-adjusted gross margin was 54.4%, up 712 basis points (bps) year over year. The primary drivers of this improvement were strong volume growth in Plasma and Hospital and, price and additional savings from the Operational Excellence Program.The adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, up 1314 bps from the year-ago quarter. Haemonetics continued to make additional investments to expand its manufacturing footprint in the reported quarter, including its new facility in Clinton, PA. The raised full-year outlook for revenues and earnings per share indicates continued growth momentum.Haemonetics Corporation PriceHaemonetics Corporation PriceHaemonetics Corporation price | Haemonetics Corporation QuoteThe fiscal first quarter saw encouraging performance by Haemonetics’ businesses. The Hospital business revenues grew 12.7% (up 14.9% on an organic basis) in the quarter amid staffing shortages and budgetary constraints in U.S hospitals as well as continued lockdowns in China.Under the Hospital segment, revenue growth in the Hemostasis Management and Vascular Closure product lines was 4.1% and 35.9% on a year-over-year basis, respectively. Within Vascular Closure, the company strengthened its leadership in the growing electrophysiology and interventional cardiology markets. Plasma collections also rebounded in the reported quarter, as the company continued to convert its U.S Plasma customers to the Nexus Plasma collection technology. Haemonetics expects to convert all its U.S. customers to the latest Nexus PCS and NexLynk DMS platform by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.Story continuesDespite sluggish results in the Blood Center business, Whole Blood revenues grew 7%, led by favorable order timing among distributors in the Asia Pacific and EMEA, coupled with additional opportunities in North America.On the flip side, the sluggish performance of the Blood Center business in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 amid blood shortages in a difficult collection environment is concerning. Blood Center revenues declined 7% in the fiscal first quarter. Moreover, Apheresis revenues fell 13% due to unfavorable order timing, lower revenues from convalescent Plasma, collection center staffing shortages in the United States and geopolitical risk.A fall in short-term cash level raises apprehension. Weak solvency and stiff competition remain concerns. The company continues to be challenged by inflationary pressure in the global manufacturing and supply chain, including freight and raw material costs, previous divestitures and price adjustments.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ShockWave Medical SWAV, AMN Healthcare Services AMN and McKesson MCK.

DXCM is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by its strong product portfolio. A robust second-quarter 2022 performance, along with a series of favorable coverage decisions, is expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and reimbursement risks persist.So far this year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 38.9% compared with 35.5% decline of the industry and a 22.7% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical devices company and provider of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems has a market capitalization of $32.92 billion. The company projects 31.4% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. DexCom’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters, missed the same in two and matched estimates in one, delivering a negative earnings surprise of 3.4%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about DexCom's continued strength in its CGM products. The company, in August, announced the availability of the easy-to-use Dexcom ONE real-time CGM (rt-CGM) System on prescription via the NHS England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland drug tariff to everyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes using insulin.In June, DexCom announced its plans to showcase its expanded global portfolio of rt-CGM systems at the Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association conference.Positive Coverages: DexCom's products have been receiving increasing coverage over the past few months, raising our optimism. The company, in June, announced that people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes aged two years and above on multiple daily injections of insulin (three or more) or who use an insulin pump may now be eligible for public coverage of the Dexcom G6 CGM System via Prince Edward Island’s Diabetes Glucose Sensor Program.In March, DexCom announced that effective Mar 14, 2022, the Ontario government will provide coverage for the Dexcom G6 CGM System through Ontario’s Assistive Devices Program for people with type 1 diabetes living in the province who are above the age of 2 years and meet coverage criteria.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: DexCom’s solid second-quarter 2022 revenues buoy optimism. Rising volumes across all channels and strong new customer additions contributed to the upside. Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment and domestic and international revenue growth were key catalysts. DexCom also received CE Mark for an updated sensor algorithm, making the latest G7 sensor technology available to international markets.DownsidesReimbursement Risk: Reimbursement risk is somewhat high due to the efforts to control healthcare expenses. The company noted that most Type 1 patients (above 65) pay 100% of their CGM costs out of their own pockets. Unless payers (both government and private insurers) provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement, commercial success for DexCom will be limited, in our view.Stiff Competition: The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. DexCom’s competitors manufacture and market products for the single-point finger stick device market and collectively account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems, currently.Estimate TrendDexCom is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 1.3% south to 79 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $751.3 million, suggesting a 15.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.DexCom, Inc.

197,3252e33c-6107-3195-9912-58da30689c88,FOX,2022-10-01,Fox (FOXA) Adds Fox Weather to Fios TV & Amazon Freevee,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-foxa-adds-fox-weather-164004836.html,1664556004,STORY,['FOXA'],"[Fox Corporation FOXA recently announced that its Fox Weather is now available on Fios TV and Amazon Freevee.Fox Weather will be available to all Fios TV subscribers on channel 113 (SD) and channel 613 (HD), and on Amazon Freevee, viewers can access Fox Weather, a free ad-supported television channel through the app, or within the ""Live TV"" tab through Prime Video.In a short span since its launch, Fox Weather has added several distribution partners including The Roku Channel, fuboTV, YouTubeTV, Amazon News, DIRECTV STREAM, Xumo, WOW! and Vidgo.The growing popularity and rapid expansion of Fox Weather have been beneficial for Fox News Media, which is its parent company.Fox Gains From Growth of Its Multiple Business UnitsFox News Channel (“FNC”) has been performing well as it once again closed August as the best-performing news brand for 18 consecutive months, reaching more than 2.9 billion total multiplatform minutes, 1.5 billion total multiplatform views and 77 million unique multiplatform visitors, per Comscore data.The Cable Network Programming segment, which generates 44% of Fox’s revenues, witnessed 7% year-over-year growth as affiliate and advertising fees increased.The increase in advertising revenues was primarily due to higher pricing at FOX News Media and an increase in the number of live events at the national sports networks.FNC has also been benefiting from Fox Nation as its original content like Duck Family Treasure, Sharon Osbourne: To Hell &amp; Back, the upcoming Yellowstone: One-Fifty with Kevin Costner and a comedy show named A Roseanne Comedy Special, featuring Roseanne Barr, is gaining traction.Fox Nation has increased FNC’s subscriber base by approximately 80% in fiscal 2022. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.Fox’s growing user base is not only driven by Fox News but also Fox Business, which drove 151 million multiplatform views as of last month. Fox Business surpassed CNN Business and Comcast’s CMCSA MSNBC in multiplatform views for the fifth straight month.Comcast’s MSNBC lost 19% of its prime-time viewers in the first half of 2022. Per Nielsen data, its ratings have plummeted ever since The Rachel Maddow show shifted to a once-per-week format from four times per week.Fox’s investment in Flutter has benefited its sports business division as well. Together they entered into a national media and sports wagering partnership in the United States. The partnership offers the FOX Bet Super 6 national free-to-play game, which has generated a user base of more than 6 million registered accounts as of June 2022.Story continuesWhat Lies Ahead for Fox?Fox’s shares have declined 14.8% year to date compared with the Zacks Consumer &amp; Discretionary Sector, which fell 38.9%.However, Fox’s cable TV business faces a serious threat from OTT platforms due to cord-cutting and changing consumer preferences. This cord-cutting does not bode well for Fox.In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, Cable Network Programming EBITDA decreased 6.8% year over year to $628 million. The EBITDA margin contracted 520 bps to 43%.Fox also faces competition for ad dollars, which forms its main source of revenue. This is intensified by offerings from tech giants like Meta Platform’s META Facebook, Twitter TWTR, Google, YouTube and Amazon, as they too have been fighting for ad dollars.Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram. Twitter’s initiatives to add features and focus on effectively tackling abuse issues are helping it to expand the monetized user base, thereby driving ad revenues.However, Fox, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), remains confident for fiscal 2023 as the financial tailwinds from Super Bowl 57, the early exit of Thursday Night Football, the momentum heading into November's midterm elections and the start of its next major distribution cycle are expected to deliver record revenues and EBITDA.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The two companies’ previous carriage contract expired at midnight PT on Sept. 30. Dish is notorious in the pay-TV business for aggressive negotiating tactics with content companies — and hasn’t been afraid to sit through extended blackouts to try to extract more favorable terms.According to Dish, the media conglomerate had asked for a $1 billion increase in fees (though it’s not clear what that entails) and declined the pay-TV operator’s offer for a contract extension. Dish accused Disney of initiating the channel blackout and “hold[ing] viewers hostage for negotiation leverage.”Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution said Dish had rejected its “fair, market-based” offer for continuing to carry the networks.“After months of negotiating in good faith, Dish has declined to reach a fair, market-based agreement with us for continued distribution of our networks. As a result, their Dish and Sling TV subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming from the ABC-owned television stations, the ESPN networks, the Disney-branded channels, Freeform, the FX networks, the National Geographic channels and BabyTV.”According to Disney, “The rates and terms we are seeking reflect the marketplace and have been the foundation for numerous successful deals with pay-TV providers of all types and sizes across the country. We’re committed to reaching a fair resolution, and we urge Dish to work with us in order to minimize the disruption to their customers.”Story continuesDish claimed that, as part of the fee increase, Disney is demanding that ESPN and ESPN2 be included in Dish TV packages that currently exclude sports channels. In addition, while Dish TV has allowed subscribers to remove local channels to reduce their monthly bills, “Now Disney wants to take this away by forcing most Dish customers in their ABC markets to pay for local channels,” the pay-TV provider said.“Disney has exploited its market position to increase fees without regard for the public viewing experience,” Brian Neylon, EVP and group president of Dish TV, said in a statement. “Clearly, Disney insists on prioritizing greed above American viewers, especially sports fans and families with children who watch their content.”The full list of Disney-owned networks affected by the blackout are: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNews, ESPN Deportes, Disney Channel, Disney Jr., Disney XD, Freeform, FX, FXX, FXM, National Geographic, Nat Geo Wild, Nat Geo Mundo, ACC Network, SEC Network, Longhorn Network and Baby TV.ABC-owned locals that have winked off Dish and Sling TV are: Chicago (WLS), Fresno, Calif. (KFSN), Houston (KTRK), Los Angeles (KABC), New York (WABC), Philadelphia (WPVI), Raleigh, N.C. (WTVD) and San Francisco (KGO).As of June 30, Dish had 7.79 million satellite TV subscribers (down 9% year over year) and 2.20 million Sling TV subscribers (down 10% year over year).The Disney networks’ removal from Dish and Sling comes just four days after Dish reached a carriage-renewal agreement for Sony Pictures’ Game Show Network following a three-week blackout. Meanwhile, Disney had hit an impasse in carriage talks with Google’s YouTube TV in December 2021, resulting in a two-day blackout on the internet TV service.RSVP todayBest of VarietyConstance Wu Gets Candid in Revealing New Memoir 'Making a Scene'The Best Pop Culture Halloween Costumes for 2022: From 'House of the Dragon' to 'Euphoria'What's Coming to Netflix in October 2022]"

And Amazon's ""Rings of Power,"" my favorite, has come out on top, beating out ""Game of Thrones"" prequel series, ""House of the Dragon."" Now this actually marks the first time the two fantasy behemoths have faced off. And of course, the ""Lord of the Rings"" prequel series came in with 1.3 billion minutes viewed, while its dragon-filled counterpart was watched for a total of 781 million minutes.Now, to be fair, I do love both of these shows. And it does help that ""Rings of Power"" gets a head start because it comes out Friday morning at midnight, whereas we see the ""House of Dragon"" comes on, on Sundays at 9 o'clock. So a little bit of a headstart, but obviously, a very strong contender here in ""Lord of the Rings.""DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, you kind of watch it on a Friday night when people are out doing their thing, and Saturday night in college football. I'm going to go with-- I definitely think ""House of Dragon"" is going to come out on top. But that's just my sense of its pop culture relevance. The conversation seems to be driven more of ""House of Dragon"" than it does ""Rings of Power."" But I haven't seen either one. I'm kind of--SEANA SMITH: I was going to say--DAVE BRIGGS: --the outlier here.SEANA SMITH: --I haven't seen either one. Rachelle, you are the best person to talk about this. I feel like I hear a lot more about ""House of Dragon."" That's just strictly anecdotally. But from-- you love both. So if you had to bet, which one do you think really has the staying power here?RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, what's funny is I think ""House of Dragon"" gets more chat because people are so angry with it, and sort of its treatment of the book and how it sort of varied a little bit, whereas I think most of it when it comes to the ""Rings of Power,"" people love it. People are happy. Some controversy about casting, but I honestly think ""Rings of Power"" is the one that's going to stay on top. It's just-- it's too good. It's too good.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: All right, guys, while we're talking about streaming, we have to talk about a big event, at least for me, today, as we head into the spooky Halloween season. Disney sequel to the fan favorite ""Hocus Pocus"" hitting Disney+ today. It's a lot of fun. Huge fans out there. They've been waiting almost 30 years for this, for the remake here, or the sequel. I've watched the trailer. I'm a little conflicted just in terms of how much I like it. I'm a huge fan of the original.Sarah Jessica Parker is going to be-- is in this movie. I think it's going to be a huge hit for Disney. One of our producers was saying that her family had actually gotten Disney+ and also bought an account for another family member because of all the hype leading up to this video. So these numbers, Dave, could be very impressive.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't get it. I'm the guy in Big saying I'm shocked by the excitement for this film. But I will say the special effects have come a long way. Just gauging Rotten Tomatoes sentiment, 63% from the critics, 68% from the audience. Neither are stellar numbers. They're going to need some magic in order to help at the box office, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, it's tough to live up to something that's been, like, a favorite for a lot of people. And when you have that much of a distance between the original movie and the sequel, it's tough. But there is also going to be a Broadway musical of ""Hocus Pocus."" I'll be all in. Good family watching. I'm all here for it.SEANA SMITH: Me, too, Rachelle. I'm right there with you.]"

Among MSCI USA ESG Leaders, for example, 49 percent of firms discussed their climate transition plans on Q1 2022 conference calls, up from 28 percent the previous quarter.Click here to access the full Nasdaq quarterly conference call analysis report.To download our Q2 2022 quarterly ESG report, click here.Currently, the main players driving the uptick in the climate transition conversation tend to be industrials, utilities, and energy sector companies, but Nasdaq believes that the expectations for companies outside these sectors to assess their climate transition risks and disclose plans for mitigating and managing these risks will continue to rise in the next few quarters.Shea Drake, a senior analyst on Nasdaq's ESG Advisory team, says that while the key ESG themes remained unchanged from the previous quarter, the team was surprised to see just how quickly momentum had grown around these topics. ""We were expecting to see an increase, but to see the jump we saw quarter over quarter was pretty impressive,"" she says.The sell-side spotlightNasdaq's research uses natural language processing to analyze more than 3,000 earnings transcripts across the Russell 3000 and MSCI USA ESG Leaders indices to identify and gauge trends in key conversation topics across the previous quarter's earnings season in order to help guide companies in how they shape their ESG messaging going forward.Story continuesThe firm found that climate transition in particular is also increasingly coming under the sell-side spotlight. In fact, nearly half of all ESG-related questions on the earnings call Q&amp;A were related to climate transition, with analysts questioning company management about climate three to four times more frequently than any other topic.""The trends we are seeing indicate that investors are increasingly taking an interest in the growing vulnerabilities companies are facing related to climate change, adverse economic conditions and heightened geopolitical risk,"" says Michele Holtkamp, another senior analyst on the Nasdaq ESG Advisory team. ""That in particular is why we look at the Q&amp;A segment of the earnings call, to understand how frequently companies are being asked about these issues, regardless of whether they mentioned the topic in question in their prepared remarks.""The wider benefits of talking ESGWhile the figures show a big jump in conversations taking place overall across the different indexes covered in Nasdaq's research, Drake and Holtkamp point to differences across both sector and market cap.For example, supply chain management takes ""center stage"" at industrials and consumer discretionary names within the MSCI USA ESG Leaders Index, where 51 percent and 46 percent, respectively, discussed the topic on earnings calls, along with more than 40 percent of IT issuers within both the MSCI and Russell 3000 indices.Despite differences - with some companies, such as those in industrials and utilities, ""dominating the discussion around climate transition"" - Holtkamp adds that ""across all sectors, we're seeing persistent focus on human capital and supply chain management. These issues are pretty hard to ignore."" She also notes that in the prior quarter review, commentary from the tech sector suggested these companies expected supply chain constraints to decline in subsequent quarters. Now, in the Q1 earnings discussions, the prevailing theme of discussions on this topic is how companies have strengthened their supply-chain management programs to increase their relative resiliency and drive profitability.Looking at differences across cap size, Drake says it's true that at the moment there is less pressure on smaller firms around ESG. ""But that's not to say they shouldn't be thinking about ESG issues,"" she says.""As expected, large and mega-cap companies were the ones primarily leading the conversation, and we're also starting to see an uptick from mid-cap companies. Currently, small-cap companies definitely do not bring as much ESG conversation to the table and that's because they're focused on growing their businesses and also making sure they're satisfying their shareholders first.""But Drake adds that with issues like ESG, what you often see is a ""trickle-down effect."" Indeed, conversations have already begun at the small-cap level, she notes, with the expectation that momentum will grow over time.""Conversations don't have to be as robust as with an ESG leader yet,"" she notes. ""Moving forward, however, we expect ESG components to be integrated into the earnings call for small-cap companies, too.""Holtkamp adds that Nasdaq is also increasingly seeing companies start their ESG journey earlier and earlier - some even before going public. ""Pre-IPO companies are not trying to do everything at once, but by dedicating some attention towards getting the ball moving on key elements that build a strong foundation earlier on, they position themselves for stronger performance right out of the gate,"" she explains.As ESG issues have become increasingly key to company narrative, Drake says talking about these topics offers a wider benefit for both firms and the investment community: ""With the current market conditions, ESG is almost a fallback point for companies to explain how they are preparing for long-term value creation via non-financial risks and opportunities.""Click here to access the full Nasdaq quarterly conference call analysis report, featuring charts and commentary from Nasdaq for more information on how:Climate, sustainability and supply chain were the key ESG topics during Q1 earnings calls and why companies may want to be clear on their strategy around these themes;Larger companies receive more attention, but it is important that issuers across the market-cap spectrum define their ESG strategy;Incorporating ESG themes within your prepared remarks can help guide the narrative for your company and the investment community.To download our Q2 2022 quarterly ESG report, click here.Nasdaq, Inc., Friday, September 30, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Nasdaq, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Nasdaq, Inc.Website: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/corporate-esg-solutionsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Nasdaq, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/718319/ESG-on-the-Earnings-Call-Nasdaq-Data-Shows-Huge-Quarterly-Jump-in-Conversations]"

(“Dentsply Sirona” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: XRAY) today is providing a business update.As previously disclosed, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) is conducting an internal investigation regarding certain financial reporting matters. The investigation is ongoing and therefore the Company expects that it will not be in a position to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022, (the “Second Quarter 10-Q”) by the August 9, 2022, deadline.Select Preliminary Second Quarter 2022 ResultsThe Company’s operational performance improved sequentially in the quarter with net sales and adjusted EPS expected to be above preliminary first quarter 2022 results. While net sales declined year-over-year due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the business delivered organic sales growth driven by solid European regional performance and demand in strategic areas of the business, most notably, CAD/CAM, Equipment &amp; Instruments, and Restorative and Preventive Consumables.As anticipated, in the second quarter, the Company saw normalizing dealer inventory levels in the U.S. as well as realized benefits from recent product launches and pricing adjustments. The Company continued to experience macro headwinds including ongoing supply shortages and softness in sales in China due to COVID-related shutdowns.As a result, Dentsply Sirona expects to report second quarter 2022 net sales of greater than $1,005 million. Additionally, diluted EPS is expected to be at or above $0.26 and adjusted EPS at or above $0.60.The second quarter gross margin and adjusted EPS were favorably impacted by the timing of certain expenses which will be reflected in the third and fourth quarters.Story continuesFor the full year 2022 outlook, the Company’s assumptions outlined on May 10, 2022, remain intact with the exception of foreign exchange. Management expects to provide an updated full year 2022 outlook after filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 (the “First Quarter 10-Q”) and the Second Quarter 10-Q (collectively with the First Quarter 10-Q, the “Quarterly Reports”).Consistent with the Company’s commitment to return cash to shareholders, Dentsply Sirona's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share of common stock, an indicated annual rate of $0.50 per share. The dividend is payable October 14, 2022, to holders of record as of September 30, 2022.Investigation Update The Audit Committee continues to work diligently with independent counsel and advisors to complete its previously announced investigation as soon as possible. However, the Company cannot predict the duration or outcome of the investigation. Due to the pendency of the investigation, the Company has not yet filed its First Quarter 10-Q and does not believe it will file its Second Quarter 10-Q on a timely basis. In the course of the investigation, the Company has also evaluated certain other accounting practices. As a result of this review, the Company anticipates certain adjustments will be made to the previously announced preliminary first quarter financial results, and the Company is currently evaluating whether fiscal year 2021 reported financial results also require adjustments.The Company will work to finalize its financial statements and review of internal controls and procedures, including the evaluation of any deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting, as soon as practicable.As previously disclosed, the Company has voluntarily contacted the SEC to advise it that an internal investigation is underway, and the Audit Committee intends to provide additional information to the SEC as its investigation proceeds. The Company intends to fully cooperate with the SEC regarding this matter.Nasdaq Compliance Update On May 18, 2022, the Company announced it received a written notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) on May 12, 2022, indicating that the Company is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules because the Company had not timely filed its First Quarter 10-Q. In response to the notification and pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Company submitted a plan to regain compliance and it targeted filing the Quarterly Reports by August 14, 2022. The Nasdaq staff granted the Company an extension of time through August 14, 2022, in which to file the Quarterly Reports. The Company has notified Nasdaq that it no longer expects that it will be able to file the Quarterly Reports by August 14, 2022, and will submit an updated compliance plan to Nasdaq. If Nasdaq accepts the updated plan to be submitted by the Company, Nasdaq can grant an extension of time for shares of the Company’s common stock to remain listed for up to 180 calendar days from the First Quarter 10-Q’s original filing deadline to regain compliance, which would be November 7, 2022.Notice Regarding Preliminary ResultsThe Select Preliminary Second Quarter 2022 Results included above in this press release are based upon preliminary financial results.

Such statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements, many of which are outside of our control. Furthermore, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and may continue to be amplified by or may, in the future, be amplified by, the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of varying private and governmental responses that affect our customers, employees, vendors and the economies and communities where they operate. For a written description of these factors, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Dentsply Sirona’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year. No assurance can be given that any expectation, belief, goal or plan set forth in any forward-looking statement can or will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward-looking statement or to report any events or circumstances after the date of press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company has provided certain measures in this press release that are not calculated in accordance with US GAAP and therefore represent Non-GAAP measures. These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to measure its performance and may differ from those used by other companies.Management believes that these Non-GAAP measures are helpful as they provide another measure of the results of operations, and are frequently used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the Company.Organic SalesThe Company defines ""organic sales"" as the reported net sales adjusted for: (1) net sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, (2) net sales attributable to disposed businesses or discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods, and (3) the impact of foreign currency changes, which is calculated by translating current period net sales using the comparable prior period's currency exchange rates.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and MarginAdjusted operating income (loss) is computed by excluding the following items from operating income:(1) Business combination related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to the disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the post-acquisition roll-off of fair value adjustments recorded related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.(2) Restructuring program related costs and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, lease and contract termination costs, and related professional service costs associated with specific restructuring initiatives. Other costs include legal settlements, asset impairments, executive separation costs, and changes in accounting principle recorded within the period. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency, consequently restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.(3) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value in purchase accounting. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.(4) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales.Adjusted Net Income (Loss)Adjusted net income (loss) consists of the reported net income (loss) in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude the items identified above, the related income tax impacts, and discrete income tax adjustments such as: final settlement of income tax audits, discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the vesting and exercise of employee share-based compensation, any difference between the interim and annual effective tax rate, and adjustments relating to prior periods.These adjustments are irregular in timing, and the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted ShareAdjusted earnings (loss) (EPS) per diluted share is computed by dividing adjusted net income (losses) attributable to Dentsply Sirona shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.Contact InformationInvestors:Andrea DaleyVP, Investor Relations+1-704-805-1293InvestorRelations@dentsplysirona.comPress:Marion Par-WeixlbergerVP, Corporate Communications and PR+43 676 848414588marion.parweixlberger@dentsplysirona.comDENTSPLY SIRONA INC.

(NYSE: PRU), in collaboration with Playbill, Times Square Alliance, and The Broadway League, is proud to be the title sponsor of the Curtain Up Broadway Festival. The free, three-day outdoor event will take place Sept. 30 – Oct. 2 in the heart of Times Square and celebrates Broadway, a cultural icon that drives inclusion and economic growth in New York City and beyond.This press release features multimedia.

(Graphic: Business Wire)Through this sponsorship, Prudential is reaffirming its commitment to Broadway, which serves as a foundation for the New York City arts community. Prior to the pandemic, Broadway contributed $15 billion to the larger $110 billion culture sector across the city, and Prudential is proud to be a rock of support for this event celebrating the iconic institution. Beyond New York City, Broadway’s economic reach extends far and wide through touring shows that infuse almost $4 billion into nearly 200 cities across the U.S. and Canada.As part of the Curtain Up event, Prudential is also expanding access to the arts, theater community, and education programs, creating opportunities for more inclusion on Broadway. Since last year’s festival, Prudential has given away 2,400 tickets to Broadway shows at local theaters across the country through the Prudential Standing Ovations Ticket Giveaway. This year, thanks to Prudential’s support, the festival hopes to double the number of in-person guests to Times Square for the event. In addition, Curtain Up has partnered with WABC-TV to broadcast the finale concert throughout the tri-state area and with Playbill to livestream the event on its website.Story continues""We know that Broadway and local theaters help to drive inclusion and economic growth in New York City and around the world. That’s why we are so proud to bring the Curtain Up Broadway Festival back again this year and to be a rock that helps fuel the industry and welcomes more people from more places to experience it,"" said Susan Somersille Johnson, Prudential’s chief marketing officer. ""I’m also pleased to announce Prudential is donating a total of $110,000 to the Entertainment Community Fund and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, two cultural institutions that support performing arts and entertainment professionals.""As part of its sponsorship, Prudential has partnered with Brittney Johnson, an accomplished actress and the first Black woman to play the role of ""Glinda"" in the Broadway musical Wicked, to shine a spotlight on the need and opportunity for more inclusion in Broadway.""The arts are unique in that they allow us to really see each other. To me, there is no greater vulnerability than to share something you have created with another person. Theater teaches and requires us to have empathy for each other and for ourselves in real time,"" said Johnson. ""To walk with a character, a person unlike yourself, through a pivotal moment in their lives, and learn something about yourself in the process — that is the power of theater. To watch other people around you feel empathy for a person onstage and feel valued as a result — that is the power of inclusion.""In partnership with Johnson, Prudential will donate $50,000 to a nonprofit of her choosing, the Entertainment Community Fund (formerly known as The Actors Fund), an organization that embraces diversity and seeks equity and inclusion as it helps provide stability for performing arts and entertainment professionals throughout their lifetime. This effort builds on last year’s $50,000 donation that supported the organization’s critical programs that address unique needs of those working in the entertainment industry, including financial wellness workshops, support groups, online resources, and emergency financial assistance. Prudential’s financial wellness portal will be accessible to the arts community through the fund, and financial advisors will be on-site at the festival to provide information.""We’re thrilled to be back with Curtain Up in the heart of Times Square, celebrating everyone onstage and off who works so hard to bring the magic of Broadway to life,"" said Entertainment Community Fund President and CEO Joe Benincasa. ""And we’re so grateful to Brittney Johnson and Prudential for this incredible donation that will help us continue to support our community when they need us the most, now and in the years to come.""Prudential is also making a $60,000 donation to Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which is helping transform the arts landscape in the company’s hometown of Newark, New Jersey, and plays a crucial social role, using the beauty and humanity of the African American heritage and the modern dance tradition to unite people of all races, ages and backgrounds. This donation is in addition to the financial support the organization has received from Prudential for over 30 years.""Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performances uplift, enlighten and unite. Like the organization’s various education programs, they illuminate the human spirit, unlock potential, and spark change,"" stated Robert Battle, the organization’s artistic director. ""We’re thrilled to be in the heart of Times Square to invite new audiences to join in a dance workshop inspired by Alvin Ailey’s must-see masterpiece Revelations. Thank you to Prudential for this generous gift, and for a legacy of extending Ailey’s reach to connect with so many communities in meaningful ways.""Throughout the Curtain Up festival, Broadway fans can enjoy free live performances featuring marquee talent, a block party and more, culminating in the finale concert featuring a host of Broadway favorites.

(URI) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-united-rentals-130001934.html,1664542801,STORY,['URI'],"[United Rentals (URI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this equipment rental company have returned -6.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -9.5% change. The Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry, to which United Rentals belongs, has lost 11.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.United Rentals is expected to post earnings of $8.88 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $31.73 points to a change of +43.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $35.16 indicates a change of +10.8% from what United Rentals is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for United Rentals.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for URI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of United Rentals, the consensus sales estimate of $3.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +18.1%. The $11.58 billion and $12.46 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.2% and +7.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited Rentals reported revenues of $2.77 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +21.2%. EPS of $7.86 for the same period compares with $4.66 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.7 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.81%. The EPS surprise was +19.63%.Over the last four quarters, United Rentals surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United Rentals is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United Rentals. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This move is aimed at enhancing user engagement by driving efficiencies in businesses and making them more profitable. The innovations were announced at SuiteWorld 2022, held in Las Vegas, NV.The highlights include improved accounts payable automation, a configure/price/quote or CPQ utility, and a mobile application that aids in packing and shipping.NetSuite AP Automation embeds banking services into a cloud enterprise resource planning system to make it faster and easier for users to process bills and pay from the application.NetSuite Ship Central is a new mobile application that helps organizations streamline and automate operations. It gives warehouse workers packing and shipping capabilities on a mobile device or kiosk.NetSuite CPQ is aimed at helping sales teams quickly configure and price complex products by selecting from a menu of product features and applying customizable business rules. It’s integrated with the company’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), customer relationship management and e-commerce modules to allow pre-configured inventory and profitability data.The latest SuitePeople Workforce Management helps organizations manage labor costs and profitability. The solution enhances employee engagement by automating routine tasks, such as scheduling staff, tracking employee hours worked and calculation of wages.We believe that enhancing the functionalities of NetSuite with cloud-based capabilities places the solutions well to sustain their growing clout in the markets served by the company. Moreover, focus on customizing NetSuite to comply with local needs will boost global market reach.Oracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation Price and ConsensusOracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation QuoteNetSuite Adoption to Favor Top-Line GrowthOracle concluded the NetSuite acquisition in 2016. The buyout enabled the company to penetrate the small and medium-sized business market in the ERP segment, wherein it lacked a strong presence.Notably, Oracle is benefiting from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. In first-quarter fiscal 2023, NetSuite ERP revenues increased 30% in the trailing 12-month period.Per Gartner, price increases and delivery uncertainty, exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have accelerated the transition in purchasing preference among enterprises in general, from ownership to service — pushing cloud spending to 18.4% growth in 2021 with an expected growth of 22.1% in 2022.Per Fortune Business Insights data, the global ERP software market is envisioned to grow to $90.63 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 9.1% during the forecast period.The aforementioned reports favor the growth prospects of Oracle NetSuite. Markedly, Oracle has been named a Leader in the 2022 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud ERP for Service-Centric Enterprises for Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP.Management is elated that NetSuite is witnessing rapid adoption from retailers and non-profit organizations, among others. NetSuite AP Automation will initially ship with automated payment services provided by HSBC HSBC, although other banking partners are likely to be added in the future. Last month, HSBC launched variable recurring payments for open banking customers, and earlier this year, Oracle NetSuite announced a cashflow management service, Cash 360.We believe the robust adoption of NetSuite, driven by new enhancements, will aid Oracle in strengthening its dominance in the cloud ERP market.Besides, partnerships with Microsoft MSFT and VMware VMW are helping Oracle win new clientele. The company’s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.Last quarter, Microsoft and Oracle delivered a high-speed interconnection between Azure and Oracle's cloud to give Azure customers direct access to Oracle databases.Oracle’s partnership with VMware for Oracle Cloud VMware Solution has been gaining prominence, which is expected to have aided customer growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The solution has gained popularity among leading enterprises in retail, telecommunication, finance and banking, manufacturing, government and others.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s higher spending on product enhancements, especially on the cloud platform, amid increasing competition, is likely to limit margin expansion in the near term.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

All three major averages fell for the third straight quarter.The personal consumption expenditure price index, the fed’s preferred inflation measure, showed that inflation rose more than expected in August. This “compounds the pressure for the [Fed] to stay on course in its fight against inflation,” Stifel said in a note.Fed vice chair Lael Brainard on Friday cautioned against the central bank reversing course on monetary policy too early, saying monetary policy would need to be “restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target”After hiking rates by 3% in just six months, the fed continues to echo the need for further hikes, stoking worries among investors that the central bank could overshoot on tightening and push the economy into a deep recession.The push higher in inflation, however, hasn’t yet had a material impact on the consumer, according to personal spending data Friday, to force a material change in consumer spending, suggesting a deep recession isn't on the horizon.“We haven't seen that change [in consumer spending habits],” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management told Investing.com in an interview on Friday. “Our forward-looking earnings model shows that companies are forecasting strong sales estimates.”Growth sectors like consumer discretionary and tech have been in the crosshairs, with the latter down 31% this year, as a rising rate environment has soured investor sentiment on stocks with higher valuations.Despite the brutal quarter for growth stocks, Mulberry says, it’s “too early” to rotate back into growth from value stocks because “rates aren't done going up.”Story continuesThe earnings front, meanwhile, did little to turn the tide of negative sentiment as Nike (NYSE:NKE) stumbled nearly 13% following quarterly results that beat Wall Street expectations, but the sportswear giant cut its outlook on gross margin as price cuts will be needed to clear inventory levels.Nike “lowered its gross margin forecast by 200 bps … due to the need to aggressively discount mis-timed inventory as a result of supply chain challenges,” Goldman Sachs said after cutting its price target on the company to $98 from $120 prior.Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), meanwhile, was flat as investors weighed the chipmaker’s softer guidance delivery after better-than-expected results.Rent-A-Center (NASDAQ:RCII) slumped 21% after cutting third-quarter guidance as consumer demand came under pressure from weakening economic growth.Related ArticlesStock Market Today: Dow in Worst Quarterly Streak Since 2015 as Bears in ControlDisney names Carolyn Everson to board in deal with activist investor Third PointFormer Infinity Q exec settles charges related to alleged fraud]"

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Mettler-Toledo (MTD) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this maker of precision instruments a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Mettler-Toledo is 17.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 14.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -11.9%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, Mettler-Toledo has an S/TA ratio of 1.17, which means that the company gets $1.17 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.72, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Mettler-Toledo is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 5.7% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Mettler-Toledo. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineMettler-Toledo has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Mettler-Toledo well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is not going to stop if the economy crashes. Transaction volumes might decline, and the total amount of spending through the network might also decline, but people still need to buy and sell essential items in an economic downturn. The economy will eventually recover, and these companies even have built-in inflation protection by taking a percentage of each transaction as revenue.Whats more, the general global shift away from cash towards digital payments over the past few decades was further accelerated by the pandemic, which should offset some of the declines in transaction volumes.But the question for investors is, is any one of these payments processing stocks offering better value than the others, or are they all the same?

I want to begin by pointing out that Visa and Mastercard are more similar to each other than to American Express.American Express is more like a bank because, in addition to operating a payments network, it also lends money to consumers on its credit cards. This means it is more exposed to the economic downturn because if customers run into financial difficulties, they are unlikely to be unable to repay their outstanding liabilities in full. This means American Express has more exposure to potential defaults and customer losses.Story continuesAnd we can see how this has influenced the market's opinion of the business. It is currently trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 12.5, compared to 21 for Visa and 24 for Mastercard.Due to the difference in business models, Visa and Mastercard are about twice as profitable as American Express, although the return on equity across the group is relatively similar.When it comes to balance sheet strength, both Visa and Mastercard have net cash balances compared to American Express complex balance sheet of assets and liabilities.Looking at these three companies, Visa and Mastercard appear to have the better operating performance, although American Express is significantly cheaper.The valuation cushion As American Express operates more like a bank than a fintech company, it is a bit more complex to understand. However, the stock is cheaper, and there is more of a valuation cushion here.At more than 20 times forward earnings, Visa and Mastercard still look expensive on some metrics, especially if we are heading into an economic downturn. If we see valuations suddenly plunge across the market, these companies are significantly more exposed than American Express.But that does not mean they will underperform in the long term. History shows that expensive companies can remain expensive as long as they continue to earn higher returns on equity and post market-beating growth.Another thing to note is the dividend yield on American Express shares. The stock currently supports a yield of 1.6%, compared to 0.9% for Visa and 0.7% for Mastercard.So the question of which stock is the better value in the current environment really depends on ones understanding of the financial sector and objectives. American Express is a more complex business, but the stock is cheaper. Visa and Mastercard are easier to understand. Still, they do command premium valuations. This may not hold up in an economic downturn, although over the next 20 years or so, this is unlikely to be an issue.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Don't Ignore These 2 Finance Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130001698.html,1664542801,STORY,"['AXP', 'EZPW']","[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. American Express (AXP) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.47 a share 21 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 21, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.47 Most Accurate Estimate and the $2.38 Zacks Consensus Estimate, American Express has an Earnings ESP of 3.57%.AXP is just one of a large group of Finance stocks with a positive ESP figure. Ezcorp (EZPW) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Ezcorp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 16, 2022. EZPW's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.12 a share 47 days from its next earnings release.For Ezcorp, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.11 is 9.09%.Story continuesAXP and EZPW's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

On a year-over-year basis, the top and bottom lines increased by 27.1% and 17.9%, respectively.Acuity Brands beat earnings expectations in the trailing nine quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionFor the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share has decreased to $3.35 from $3.40 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates an increase of 2.5% from $3.27 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.11 billion, suggesting an 11.7% increase from $992.7 million a year ago.Acuity Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseAcuity Brands Inc Price and EPS SurpriseAcuity Brands Inc price-eps-surprise | Acuity Brands Inc QuoteFactors to NoteThe focus on product vitality and service levels, solid contribution from its Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls or ABL segment, benefits from recent price increases and the OSRAM DS business acquisition are likely to have driven growth for Acuity Brands during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.The company is focused on investing in product development. It has been introducing new lighting and controls products and evolving certain parts of the product and solutions portfolio. These products use fewer inputs and are highly mobile. Some of the products are globally sourced, while others are manufactured in the company’s facilities to mitigate the supply-chain complexity, thereby helping in improving margins.The company has been investing in prioritizing deliveries for customers when others have been unable to. It has been focusing on certain areas to create compelling new products that are both innovative and market-moving. These moves are likely to have contributed to fiscal fourth-quarter revenues.Segment-wise, it remains optimistic about the ABL business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABL segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,070 million, up from $1,061 million in the fiscal third quarter.Despite higher raw materials and freight costs, along with supply-chain interruptions for electrical components, Acuity Brands’ fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 earnings are likely to have registered a year-over-year growth, given effective cost management and price increase across the portfolio.The company has been banking on its strength in go-to-market channels and product portfolio. Its focus on service and product vitality and inorganic moves also bode well. The acquisition of a developer and manufacturer of lighting components — OSRAM’s North American Digital Systems business in July 2021 — is expected to have contributed to its top line.Story continuesWhat Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AYI this time around.

PWR is scheduled to report second-quarter 2022 results on Aug 4, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.3% and grew 65.1% year over year. Total revenues surpassed the consensus mark by 8.1% and increased 47% year over year.Encouragingly, earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 12 of the trailing 13 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has moved downward to $1.51 from $1.54 per share over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a 42.5% increase from the year-ago earnings of $1.06 per share.

Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteMore demand for infrastructure solutions that help support customers' energy-transition initiatives and modernization will help PWR to drive growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has been capitalizing on the megatrends to lead the energy transition and enable technological development. Initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining momentum. These factors should help the company to boost its profit level.Segment-wise, the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment (accounting for almost 59% of total revenues) is likely to have benefited from broad-based business strength driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid execution. Also, contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from the acquired businesses are likely to have supported bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, higher profitability from the LUMA joint venture and other integral unconsolidated affiliates, along with communications and electric operations, might have added to the positives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electric Power segment’s revenues is pegged at $2,017 million, implying a decline from $2,148 million a year ago.The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment (accounting for almost 14% of total revenues) has been benefiting from higher demand for gas utility and pipeline integrity services and pent-up demand for the services that were deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. Uncertainties in the energy market and economy caused by COVID-19 have been impacting the segment performances.With the addition of Blattner to its portfolio, PWR has started reporting through three segments by adding a new Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment during the fourth quarter  of 2021. This platform consists of services and solutions for infrastructure supporting the delivery of renewable energy, including renewable generation, electric transmission, substations and battery storage, with Blattner's operations representing the majority of those solutions. This addition is expected to have contributed to the company’s top line in the quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Quanta Services this time around.

Also, it authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of its outstanding common stock.United Rentals, Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Broadcom AVGO, Analog Devices ADI, NetApp NTAP and Amdocs Ltd. DOX.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:4 Dividend-Paying Stocks to Watch in the Tech SectorThe broader equity market has had a terrible run so far this year. The major stock indexes, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500, have fallen 18.3%, 29.4% and 22%, respectively, year to date (YTD).The equity market has been hammered by recession fears, inflationary pressure and soaring interest rates. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about the global economic recovery.Technology is among the most-battered sectors amid a broader market sell-off this year so far. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the Technology Select Sector Index, has lost approximately 28% of its value YTD.Tech companies are witnessing lower demand for their products and solutions as organizations are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues. In July 2022, Gartner lowered its forecast for worldwide IT spending growth rate to 3% from 4% mentioned earlier. The research firm's report highlights that 2022 IT spending growth will be much slower than 2021 due to spending cutbacks across devices, software, IT services and communication services areas.Additionally, the sector is suffering from inflationary pressure, higher wages and currency fluctuations. Supply-chain disruptions due to an acute shortage of chips and several other components are affecting the profitability of the companies in the space.Story continuesThe aforementioned challenges are likely to persist in the near term, thereby negatively impacting the overall financial performances of the majority of tech stocks. We believe that investing in high-quality dividend-paying tech stocks like — Broadcom, Analog Devices, NetApp and Amdocs Ltd.— amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and the highly volatile market scenario might fetch handsome returns.A stock with a history of increasing dividends is considered healthy and offers a capital appreciation opportunity irrespective of stock market movements. Dividend growth stocks generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and offer downside protection with a consistent increase in payouts.Watch These Dividend-Paying Tech StocksWe ran the Zacks Stocks Screener to identify stocks that have a dividend yield in excess of 2% with five-year historical dividend growth of more than 0.1%. Furthermore, we have narrowed down our search by considering stocks with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a dividend payout ratio of less than 60%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's discuss the above-mentioned tech stocks in detail:Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based devices and analog III-V based products.Broadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking solutions, PON fiber and cable modems. The strong adoption of Broadcom's server storage solutions by hyperscalers, an acceleration in 5G deployment, production ramp-up and an increase in radio frequency content are driving top-line growth. Additionally, the robust adoption of Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E for access gateways, courtesy of solid demand from homes, enterprises, telcos and other service providers, is expected to continue driving revenue growth in the broadband end market.The stock has a dividend yield of 3.53% and a five-year historical dividend growth of 30.3%. Further, AVGO's payout ratio is 51% of earnings at present. Check Broadcom's dividend history here.Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits.Analog Devices is riding on the strength across consumer, communications, industrial and automotive markets. Solid demand for high-performance analog as well as mixed-signal solutions is a tailwind. Strong momentum across electric vehicle space on the back of its robust Battery Management System solutions is anticipated to drive growth in the long run.The company has a dividend yield of 2.14% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of approximately 12%. Its dividend payout ratio is 35% of earnings. Check Analog Devices' dividend history here.NetApp provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. The Sunnyvale, CA-based company's product line comprises two storage platforms — the FAS storage platform and the E-Series platform. The company's all-flash storage portfolio comprises NVMe-based storage systems and new cloud-based services in order to provide hybrid storage architecture.NetApp is benefiting from continued strength in Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments and robust billings growth. The company is well positioned to gain from data-driven digital and cloud transformations. Also, it is gaining from the higher clout of FAS hybrid arrays and storage systems portfolio. The rapid adoption of Azure NetApp Files, Amazon Web Services FSx for ONTAP and Google CVS is a tailwind. Recent collaborations with Kyndryl, NVIDIA and Alluxio bode well.NTAP has a dividend yield of 3.2% and a five-year annualized dividend growth of 21.4%. Also, the company's payout ratio is 45% of earnings at present. Check NetApp's dividend history here.Amdocs is one of the leading providers of customer care, billing and order management systems for communications and Internet services.

Moreover, it provides advertising and media services for media publishers, TV networks, video streaming providers, advertising agencies and service providers.Amdocs is benefiting from its recurring revenue business model. Customer additions and solid demand for managed services are primary growth drivers. The company's growth momentum is expected to continue due to its initiatives to aid digital, media, network and cloud transformations of its clients. The acquisition of Openet has rapidly expanded its footprint in 5G cellular networks. Its solutions have been selected by the likes of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile to bolster their 5G footprint.The stock has a dividend yield of 2.01% and a five-year historical dividend growth of 13.1%.

The tree-trimming project will ensure better upkeep of trees, enhance electric service reliability and reduce the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages, especially during severe weather conditions.As part of the $33 million vegetation management program, Potomac Edison will cut trees along nearly 3,100 miles of distribution power lines in Maryland and West Virginia this year. Instead of sending ground crews to each facility, FE is deploying aerial saw services that are quicker and more effective in areas that are environmentally sensitive or inaccessible to bucket trucks and other vehicles. This safe and efficient method of trimming typically covers more area in a day than a ground crew might complete in a week.Need for MaintenanceMaintaining vegetation along power lines is the first defense mechanism in preventing tree-related power outages. This ensures that transmission lines operate properly during extreme weather to efficiently transfer high-voltage power from generation units to designated locations.FirstEnergy is working steadily on maintaining its infrastructure. It employs tree contractors annually who work round the year to ensure proper vegetation management in the company’s electric lines. The aerial saw service used by FE cleanly cuts tree limbs 8-10 inches in diameter, which fall straight to the ground propelled by air blasts from the helicopter rotors. This fast, secure and efficient method of tree-trimming reduced service interruption by 20% in 2021 compared with 2019.On Sep 14, 2022, FirstEnergy’s another unit, The Illuminating Company, completed the vegetation management of a complex $3 million tree-trimming project for nearly 100 power lines in the City of Cleveland. The project will enhance electric service reliability for more than 25,000 customers and provide greater flexibility to restore power outages during the upcoming winter storm season.Utilities’ Focus on InfrastructureTo provide 24X7 electricity supply to consumers, utilities are investing heavily in strengthening their infrastructure. They are replacing old transmission and distribution lines, undergrounding distribution lines and going for technological upgrades to increase the resiliency of infrastructure for withstanding the impact of extreme weather conditions. Xcel Energy XEL, NiSource NI and Pinnacle West Capital PNW are some of the leading utilities.Xcel Energy continues to invest substantially in its utility assets and aims to strengthen and expand its transmission, distribution, electric generation and renewable projects. XEL aims to spend $26 billion during the 2022-2026 period, which includes $1.5 to $2.5 billion in incremental opportunities.NiSource is working on a long-term utility infrastructure modernization program and made capital investments worth $1.9 billion in 2021. It plans to invest in the range of $2.4-$2.7 billion in 2022. NI estimated $40-billion long-term natural gas and electric infrastructure investment opportunities, which are expected to drive earnings beyond 2024.To efficiently serve its expanding customer base, Pinnacle West Capital has systematic investment plans to increase generation and strengthen its transmission and distribution lines. After investing $1.5 billion in 2021, it aims at investing $1.53 billion in 2022.  Pinnacle West Capital also plans to invest $4.7 billion during the 2022-2024 period.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceCurrently, FirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past month, shares of FE have declined 6%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 10.5%.

While the stock has lost 11.4% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why PPL Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of PPL shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 25.25. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.3-month RSI Chart for PPLThis technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering PPL in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Moreover, PPL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

239,2a71a780-53e3-3325-b329-62ac8e42c9f2,OXY,2022-10-01,4 Integrated US Stocks to Gain as Oil Price Remains High,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-integrated-us-stocks-gain-134501014.html,1664545501,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'OXY', 'HES', 'COP']","[Oil prices are still highly favorable for upstream business, despite volatilities and uncertainties are affecting the energy market. Integrated energy players’ midstream business is also sound since the companies generate stable fee-based revenues from pipeline and storage assets, thereby enhancing the outlook for the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry.Among the frontrunners in the industry that will possibly make the most of the handsome business scenario are ConocoPhillips COP, Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY, Hess Corporation HES and Cactus Inc. WHD.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry comprises companies mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses. The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States. The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipeline networks and storage sites. Overall, the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and gas prices. The produced commodity volumes are then transported through midstream assets, generating stable fee-based revenues. The integrated energy players in the United States also have access to downstream operations wherein the transported oil volumes are converted to finished products, comprising gasoline, natural gas liquids and diesel, through refining activities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated IndustryOil Price Still High:The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading higher than the $80-per-barrel mark, still favorable for exploration and production activities. Possibilities of weak global economic growth, as central banks continue to raise interest rates to combat high inflations, could hurt oil demand. This bearish factor will probably get outweighed by the looming winter, which could increase the demand for heating oil, supporting crude price, at least in the short run.Story continuesStable Fee-Based Revenues:The integrated companies’ midstream business is relatively less exposed to the volatility in commodity prices. This is because the pipeline and storage assets are usually booked by shippers for the long term, securing stable fee-based revenues.Climate Change Position:Integrated players in the United States have recognized climate change as a serious risk that needs to be addressed. The companies are now focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and flaring rates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish OutlookThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry is a 10-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #96, which places it in the top 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry has surpassed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has risen 49.1% over this period against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 15.7% and the broader sector’s growth of 16.7%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 4.12X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 11.42X. It is, however, higher than the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.25X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.41X, as low as 3.33X, with a median of 5.84X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio4 US Integrated Oil Stocks Moving Ahead of the PackCactus: Cactus has been aiding its clients in fast-tracking their well drilling and completion activities. The company has also been enabling lower operator emissions per barrel of production. Thus, there has been a significantly lower carbon intensity per well. Cactus sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and has witnessed upward earnings estimate revisions for 2022 and 2023 over the past 30 days.Price and Consensus: WHDConocoPhillips: Considering production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the world. COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. The energy major has increased its planned 2022 return of capital to $15 billion.ConocoPhillips, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is likely to see earnings growth of 141.9% for 2022.   You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: COPHess: Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading upstream firm with a footprint in Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana. The firm believes that its position in Guyana is strong enough to generate growth in long-term cashflows.For 2022, Hess, carrying a Zacks Rank #3, has seen three upward earnings estimate revisions in the past 60 days.Price and Consensus: HESOccidental Petroleum: Headquartered in Houston, TX, Occidental Petroleum is an oil and natural gas explorer with a presence in the midstream energy business. Apart from additional cost-saving measures, it has been capturing acquisition cost synergies, aiding its bottom line.OXY has seen upward earnings estimate revisions for its 2022 bottom line over the past 30 days.

Shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company have exhibited a decent run on the bourses in the past six months. In the said period, the stock has increased 19.8% against the industry’s decline of 24.6%.Let’s Delve DeeperOllie's Bargain’s focus on value-driven merchandise assortments positioned it well to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace and effectively meet consumer demand. Ollie's Army continued to be a major sales driver, with membership increasing continuously. In second-quarter fiscal 2022, Ollie's Army rose 6%, ending the period with more than 12.9 million active members. The company attained 80% sales penetration in the quarter.Ollie's Bargain should benefit from a favorable closeout environment and increased trade-down activity. The company estimates third-quarter fiscal 2022 net sales between $426 million and $434 million, up from the $383.5 million reported in the year-ago period. It expects comparable store sales growth of 3.5% to 5.5% against the 15.5% decline witnessed in the prior-year quarter. Management envisions fiscal 2022 net sales between $1.843 billion and $1.861 billion, suggesting an increase from the $1.753 billion reported in fiscal 2021. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFact ChecksOllie's Bargain’s results depend on the availability of the brand name and closeout merchandise at compelling prices. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented about 65%, and non-closeout goods and private label products collectively accounted for roughly 35% of fiscal 2021 merchandise purchases.As far as the company’s store growth strategy is concerned, management aims for a store count of at least 1,050 in the long run. Ollie's Bargain has increased its store base at a CAGR of 12.6%, from 268 stores in fiscal 2017 to 431 stores in fiscal 2021. We note that the company opened 42 stores in fiscal 2019 and 46 stores in both fiscal 2020 and 2021. The company intends to open 41 to 43 new stores, less two relocations and one closure.Taking a cue from the past, we noticed that net sales have surged at a CAGR of 13% from $1.077 billion in fiscal 2017 to $1.753 billion in fiscal 2021, while net income has soared from $127.6 million to $157.5 million during the aforementioned period.Story continuesBottom LineQuite apparent, Ollie's Bargain strategic endeavors position the stock firmly for growth. While the company faces supply chain headwinds and high labor costs, we believe that improved closeout opportunities, increased trade down from consumers and significant room for increasing store count should support the stock.Ollie's Bargain currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).3 Hot Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted three top-ranked stocks, namely Dillard's DDS, Ulta Beauty ULTA and Arhaus ARHS.Dillard's, which operates retail department stores, sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Zacks analyst believes that lower realized prices in the United States, loss of exclusivity for products and stiff competition are affecting company’s sales. Sales are also being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The supply challenges for Wegovy have impacted the stock. The patent expiry on some of the products in Novo Nordisk’s portfolio remains a woe.However, the promising diabetes drug, Ozempic, is off to a solid start since its launch.

Focus on growth via acquisitions and organic initiatives, which aided its entry into new markets and helped it gain cross-selling opportunities, bodes well. Intense focus on Market Technology and Information Services businesses also helps the company to explore vast opportunities per its developmental strategies.Nasdaq remains committed to deploy capital effectively by investing in organic growth initiatives.

245,5e887046-af9c-351f-abc2-55ac196ec883,KO,2022-10-01,Do Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) Earnings Warrant Your Attention?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-colas-nyse-ko-earnings-110103821.html,1664622063,STORY,['KO'],"[Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola How Quickly Is Coca-Cola Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Over the last three years, Coca-Cola has grown EPS by 10% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While Coca-Cola did well to grow revenue over the last year, EBIT margins were dampened at the same time. So if EBIT margins can stabilize, this top-line growth should pay off for shareholders.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Coca-Cola?Story continuesAre Coca-Cola Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Coca-Cola has a market capitalisation of US$242b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$1.6b. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Coca-Cola but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Coca-Cola Worth Keeping An Eye On?One important encouraging feature of Coca-Cola is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.Although Coca-Cola certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

247,bf74b82a-37af-3b2d-8ce3-d742550ccc39,MHK,2022-10-01,Cracker Barrel Old Country Store and Mohawk Industries have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cracker-barrel-old-country-store-134601424.html,1664545561,STORY,"['MHK', 'DINO', 'XOM', 'FANG', 'CBRL']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 30, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Cracker Barrel Old Country Store CBRL as the Bull of the Day and Mohawk Industries MHK as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on HF Sinclair DINO, ExxonMobil XOM and Diamondback Energy FANG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is engaged in the ownership and operation of full-service restaurants with a restaurant and a retail store in the same unit. Their popular signs can be seen all over the country when one takes a road trip on America's highways.2022 has not been kind to the stock, which is down over 25%. Additionally, the stock is off over 45% from its 2021 highs. So, is now the time to buy?A recent earnings beat was not initially good enough for investors, causing the stock to traded lower. However, the stock came off its post-earnings lows as analysts raised estimates. Investors should watch this one closely as the overall stock market tries to find its footing. About the Company Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and is headquartered in Lebanon, TN. The company operates over 650 stores in 45 states and has a market cap of $2 Billion.The company aims to provide an environment that has a friendly home-away-from-home feel. They provide home-style meals and a retail shop that offers unique gifts and self-indulgences.The stock has Zacks Style Scores of ""B"" in Value and ""A"" in Momentum. The stock also pays a hefty 5.4% dividend. Q4 Earnings Beat On September 27th, the company reported an earnings beat of 14%. Revenues came in below expectations, but the company guided initial FY23 revenues up 7-8%.Comparable restaurant sales were up 6.1%, while operating income margin ticked up to 4.4% from 4.3% last quarter.A couple negatives in the guidance was commodity inflation +8% and wage inflation +5%. These will add to cost pressures but management seemed optimistic, with the CEO saying:Story continues""Despite the high levels of commodity inflation we faced throughout the year, we kept a long-term focus and invested to retain a position of value leadership through a thoughtful combination of pricing strategy and menu design, despite the short-term impact on margin. Our commitment to value and in delivering a great guest experience helped us weather a weaker than expected summer travel season, gas prices that exceeded expectations, and historic inflationary pressures on the consumer, and we were encouraged by better traffic and sales trends in the final few weeks of the quarter. I believe our focus on delivering a compelling value and experience to our guests, coupled with our cost savings programs, investments in technology, and strategies to attract a broader group of guests, position us well for fiscal 2023 and beyond, particularly when inflationary pressures eventually ease.""Analyst Estimates Since the earnings report, analysts' estimates have ticked higher for the current quarter. Over the last 7 days, estimates have gone from $1.04 to $1.12, or 7%.For the current year, estimates have gone up 5% over that same time frame, from $6.06 to $6.35.If you look at a larger time frame, estimates have gone up over the last 90 days. For next year, we see a 5% gain, with the number going from $6.18 to $6.51.While commodity inflation has hurt margins, some analysts are making the case that the recent fall in commodities could help improve margins next year.The TechnicalsWhen looking at the charts, there is not much to like. The stock is below all the moving averages, with the 50-day MA at $104 and the 200-day at $111. Until the bulls push price over those levels, the bears are in control.However, the stock does have a nice dividend, so some investors are very interested in current levels.The recent pullback has fallen into a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement drawn from June lows to recent highs. This buy zone seems to be an area of interest and if it holds, could start a move back above $100.Bottom Line The current market atmosphere is not the best for investors. However, there are stocks that are approaching buyable levels. Watch support zones for buyers and if the levels hold up, it could be a great buying opportunity.Cracker Barrel presents one such opportunity, especially if the market can gain some footing into the end of the yearBear of the Day:Mohawk Industries is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) designs, manufactures, sources, distributes, and markets flooring products for remodeling and new constructions of residential and commercial spaces.The stock has been on a steady slide since its highs in 2021, down over 60% from the high mark of $231.80. So far in 2022, the stock is down 50% and drifting towards its COVID lows.So, is there any reason to buy this dip?While the company did beat Q2 earnings, a big guide lower forced analysts to take down numbers. Until this momentum to the downside improves, investors should shy away.About the Company Mohawk is headquartered in Calhoun, GA. The company was founded in 1982 and employs 43,000 people.Mohawk manufactures carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, and vinyl flooring. This makes the company sensitive to housing improvements, which has been hurt due to higher interest rates.The company has reorganized its business into three segments — Global Ceramic (35% of net sales), Flooring North America (Flooring NA) (37% of net sales), and Flooring Rest of the World (Flooring ROW) (28% of net sales).MHK is valued at $6 billion and has a Forward PE of 7. The company holds a Zacks Style Scores of ""A"" in Value, but ""D"" in Growth. The stock is a value play for most, but pays no dividend. Q2 Earnings The company last reported EPS on July 28th, beating expectations by only 1%. Revenues came in slightly below expectations, but the company guided Q3 lower.Instead of the expected $4.14, the company now sees Q3 at a range of $3.33-3.43. The company announced they will cut expenses and implement multiple restructuring projects to cut costs.Management said that they needed to adapt to current conditions to improve results. This means cost cutting by $30-$40 million annually.EstimatesBecause of the guide lower, analysts have been forced to lower their estimates.For the current quarter, over the last 60 days estimates have dropped 14%, from $4.05 to $3.47. For next quarter, the numbers have fallen 11% over the same time frame.Analyst are not being as aggressive in dropping their numbers for next year, as they likely want to see how the cost cutting is implemented. For next year, estimates have fallen only 9%.Technical TakeLike most stocks this year, it is trading under all the moving averages. The 50-day MA is at $114 and the 200-day is at $135. These levels are significantly above the current trading price.The stock has been bleeding out and is looking for support. The next area of interest for the bulls is all the way down at $80. So, patience is suggested with this name.In SummaryMohawk is going to struggle as long as interest rates continue to go higher. The effect that rates have on housing and consumers will likely hurt earnings. Add in higher inflationary costs and the cost cutting program might not be enough to improve results.Additional content:3 Energy Stocks with Dividend ComfortThe Energy sector is infamous for being notoriously volatile, with sudden positive surprises and crashes. While wild price moves have always been integral to investment in oil and natural gas, the quantum of uncertainty has increased manifold in recent years, especially post-COVID.Amid an erratic market setting, investing in high-quality dividend stocks like HF Sinclair, ExxonMobil and Diamondback Energy might fetch you promising returns.Use Dividend to Shield From Unpredictable Energy PricesFrom the depths of minus $38 a barrel during the height of the pandemic in April 2020 to a 14-year high surge of above $130 per barrel this March and finally around $80 now, crude has been on a roller-coaster ride over the past few years. It's not any different for natural gas.The fuel slumped to a 25-year low in June 2020 but earlier this year hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 before falling to the current $7-level. Diverse factors ranging from demand/supply fundamentals to economic events to geopolitical/weather shocks influence commodity price realizations.As evident from the energy market story, stocks can take a sudden turn for the good (or bad), making stock picking a risky game. Every good stock also has its bad day, which adds to the risk. With uncertainty ruling the markets, it is not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing themes.Dividend stocks are always investors' preferred choices as they provide steady income and cushion against market risks. These stocks are generally less volatile in nature and hence, are dependable when it comes to long-term investment planning. They not only offer higher income but also protect against equity market risks.Dividend stocks are safe bets to create wealth, as the payouts generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and simultaneously provide downside protection by offering sizable yields on a regular basis. Finally, dividend growth can also help investors to offset some of the value destruction of the high inflationary environment prevailing at the moment.How to Pick the Best Dividend Stocks?Although the benefits of dividend investing cannot be stressed enough, one should keep in mind that not every company can keep up with its dividend-paying momentum. Hence, a cautious strategy needs to be followed to select the best dividend stocks with the potential for steady returns.To guide investors to the right picks, we are recommending stocks with a payout ratio less than 60 and dividend yield of at least 2%. Moreover, these companies have hiked their dividends over the past five years.Calculated by dividing dividend per share by earnings per share, the payout ratio indicates how comfortably a firm can pay the dividend from its earnings. It is one of the key metrics that dividend growth investors consider when looking for potential investments. A payout ratio below 60 looks quite sustainable and leaves enough scope for future dividend hikes.With our objective to build a dividend income portfolio, we look for companies that at least have better yields than the S&amp;P 500. A representative of the broader market, the index currently yields 1.66%. While our yield criterion isn't very high, it's at a level where the company can weather all kinds of commodity price environments and provide a reliable income stream to investors.Finally, we only consider stocks that have consistent dividend, i.e., paying and increasing offerings over the past five years. It also acts as an indicator of what to expect from the company in the next few years on the payout front.Our ChoicesWe have used the above criteria to narrow down three dividend-paying energy stocks.HF Sinclair: A producer and marketer of gasoline, diesel fuel and other specialty products, HF Sinclair pays out a quarterly dividend of 40 cents ($1.60 annualized) per share that gives it a 3.16% yield at the current stock price. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company's payout ratio is 21, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 3.62%. (Check HF Sinclair's dividend history here)You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DINO is valued at some $11 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HF Sinclair's 2022 earnings has been revised 18.1% upward over the past 60 days. The donwnstream operator has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 710.1%, on average. DINO shares have gained 63.8% in a year.ExxonMobil: ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, which participates in every aspect related to energy — from oil production to refining and marketing. XOM's dividend of 88 cents per share ($3.52 annualized) represents a 4.11% yield. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ExxonMobil's payout ratio is 36, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 2.80%. (Check ExxonMobil's dividend history here)ExxonMobil is valued at some $357.3 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for XOM's 2022 earnings has been revised 5.3% upward over the past 60 days. ExxonMobil, headquartered in Irving, TX, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 1.6%, on average. XOM shares have gained 51.1% in a year.Diamondback Energy: Diamondback Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration &amp; production company with its primary focus on the Permian Basin. FANG's dividend of $3.05 per share comprises 75 cents ($3 annualized) in regular payout, plus a variable cash component of $2.30 apiece. The regular component represents a 2.64% yield. The #2 Ranked Diamondback's payout ratio is 15, with a five-year dividend growth rate of 57.26%. (Check Diamondback Energy's dividend history here)Diamondback is valued at some $19.7 billion. For 2022, FANG has a projected earnings growth rate of 128.4%. Diamondback, headquartered in Midland, TX, has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 7%, on average. FANG shares have gained 26.1% in a year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

249,8c79dde6-8df6-3d3a-9272-2df8780b6491,INTU,2022-10-01,"With 85% institutional ownership, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-institutional-ownership-intuit-inc-110109024.html,1664622069,STORY,['INTU'],"[Every investor in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Intuit. See our latest analysis for Intuit ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuit?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Intuit already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Intuit's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intuit. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.6%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.6% and 6.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of IntuitWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Intuit Inc.. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$3.0b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Intuit. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Intuit  that you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for DaVita The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At DaVitaOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Chief Operating Officer of Kidney Care Michael Staffieri for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$77.70 per share. That implies that an insider found the current price of US$85.68 per share to be enticing. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. Happily, the DaVita insider decided to buy shares at close to current prices. Michael Staffieri was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.DaVita Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significantly more insider buying, than insider selling, at DaVita. We can see that Chief Operating Officer of Kidney Care Michael Staffieri paid US$1.6m for shares in the company. But Independent Director Barbara Desoer sold shares worth US$226k. Insiders have spent more buying shares than they have selling, so on balance we think they are are probably optimistic.Story continuesDoes DaVita Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 1.2% of DaVita shares, worth about US$95m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About DaVita Insiders?It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of DaVita we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for DaVita you should know about.But note: DaVita may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The figure, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.3%.The second-quarter revenue compares to our own estimate of $2.94 billion.Management noted that the top line was primarily owing to normal seasonal improvements driven by patients meeting their co-insurance and deductibles; and the continued shift to Medicare Advantage plans. However, the quarterly revenues were negatively impacted by a seasonal decline in hospital inpatient dialysis treatments and a lower government rate related to the reinstatement of 1% Medicare sequestration beginning Apr 1.Management also noted that excess mortality was down significantly from the sequentially last-reported quarter with the recession of the impact of the first Omicron surge.Segment DetailsThe company’s dialysis patient service revenues were $2.81 billion, down by 0.3% year over year.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same currently stands at $7.80.Our TakeDaVita ended the second quarter of 2021 with lower-than-expected revenues. Dismal overall bottom-line result is disappointing. A fall in the company’s dialysis patient service revenues during the second quarter is concerning. Contraction of both margins also does not bode well for the company. Foreign exchange headwinds and stiff competition continue to weigh on DVA.However, the company registered strength in Other revenues during the period, which is impressive. The acquisition of several dialysis centers and opening of others, both within the United States and overseas, are also encouraging. Per-day increase in total U.S. dialysis treatments is also promising.Zacks Rank and Key PicksDaVita currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Quest Diagnostics Incorporated DGX, Humana Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Airbnb Inc. ABNB, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, VeriSign Inc. VRSN, CDW Corp. CDW and Zscaler Inc. ZS.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Beaten-Down, Nasdaq-Listed Tech Stocks with Solid UpsideU.S. stock markets witnessed a broad-based decline in September. Although historically September is the worst-performing month on Wall Street, this year it is likely to be the most disastrous in a decade courtesy of an ultra-hawkish Fed. The central bank has raised the benchmark lending rate by 3% year to date.As the Fed has given a clear indication of the continuation of a rigorous interest rate hike and tighter monetary control, a global financial crisis looms larger. Market participants are pricing the cost of an imminent recession in stock valuation.Currently, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 indexes are in bear market territory. Surprisingly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite — which is most susceptible to the Fed's higher interest rate regime — is currently outside the bear market zone. Wall Street seems grossly oversold despite the continuation of the Fed's tighter monetary control. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have plunged 18.3%, 22% and 29.4%, respectively.Several Nasdaq Composite listed stocks are currently available at attractive valuations. Investment in these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should be fruitful to gain in the near term. Here are five such stocks — Airbnb Inc., Fortinet Inc., VeriSign Inc., CDW Corp. and Zscaler Inc..Nasdaq Composite Exits Bear MarketIn the last two coronavirus-ridden years, the Nasdaq Composite recorded an astonishing rally of more than 140%. The tech-heavy index recorded its all-time high of 16212.23 on Nov 22, 2021. The meteoric rise of the technology stocks was the sole reason for this impressive rally. Consequently, investors started profit booking in this sector from the beginning of 2022.Story continuesMoreover, mounting inflation compelled the Fed to significantly raise the benchmark interest rate from March this year. The central bank also imposed tougher monetary control sucking liquidity from the economy and raising the market's risk-free returns.A higher interest rate is detrimental to the growth sectors like technology. Consequently, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite entered the bear market on Mar 7, 2022 after declining more than 20% from its recent high recorded on Nov 22.After entering the bear market, the Nasdaq Composite registered its recent low of 10,565.14 on Jun 16. Finally, on Aug 4, the Nasdaq Composite exited the bear market after rallying more than 20% from its recent low.After forming the new bull market, the Nasdaq Composite reached its highest at 13,181.09 on Aug 16. Thereafter, the tech-laden index has taken a downturn once again following a tougher-than-expected monetary stance by the Fed.Despite the recent decline, the Nasdaq Composite has fallen just 16.2% from its recent high. As a result, the index is currently well outside the bear market territory.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology stocks currently trading at a deep discount to their 52-week highs. These stocks have strong potential for the rest of 2022 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Airbnb is riding on an improvement in the travel industry. Continued recovery in both longer-distance and cross-border travel owing to a reduction in travel restrictions is benefiting ABNB's Nights &amp; Experience bookings. Additionally, growth in Average Daily Rates and Gross Booking Value is acting as a tailwind.Growing active listings in Latin America, North America and EMEA are contributing well to the top line.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.5% over the last 30 days. ABNB is currently trading at a 47.9% discount from its 52-week high.Fortinet is benefiting from rising demand for security and networking products amid the coronavirus crisis as a huge global workforce is working remotely. FTNT is also benefiting from robust growth in Fortinet Security Fabric, cloud and Software-defined Wide Area Network offerings.Moreover, continued deal wins, especially those of high value, are solid drivers. Higher IT spending on cybersecurity is further expected to aid Fortinet grow faster than the security market. Also, focus on enhancing its unified threat management portfolio through product development and acquisitions is a tailwind for FTNT.Fortinet has an expected earnings growth rate of 31.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 2.9% over the last 60 days. FTNT is currently trading at a 32.8% discount from its 52-week high.VeriSign provides Internet infrastructure services that include domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services.

Growth in the healthcare end market, a resilient business model, and a solid product and solutions portfolio are key positives. Strategic acquisitions also bode well.CDW has an expected earnings growth rate of 21.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.8% over the last 60 days. CDW is currently trading at a 22.6% discount to its 52-week high.Zscaler is benefiting from the rising demand for cyber-security solutions owing to the slew of data breaches. Increasing demand for privileged access security on digital transformation and cloud-migration strategies is a key growth driver of ZS.Zscaler's portfolio boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Moreover, a strong presence across verticals, such as banking, insurance, healthcare, public sector, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications services and education, is safeguarding Zscaler from the pandemic's negative impact. Also, recent acquisitions, like Smokescreen and Trustdome, are expected to enhance ZS' portfolio.Zscaler has an expected earnings growth rate of 69.6% for the current year (for July 2023).

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.51 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on October 14, 2022.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings ESP sits at 1.08%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.51 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45.UNH is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Teladoc (TDOC) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2022, Teladoc holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.47 a share 26 days from its next quarterly update.Teladoc's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 19.09% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.59.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, UNH and TDOC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A copy of the Company’s second quarter 2022 supplemental package will be available on the Company's website at investors.regencycenters.com or by written request to: Investor Relations, Regency Centers Corporation, One Independent Drive, Suite 114, Jacksonville, Florida, 32202. The supplemental package contains more detailed financial and property results including financial statements, an outstanding debt summary, acquisition and development activity, investments in partnerships, information pertaining to securities issued other than common stock, property details, a significant tenant rent report and a lease expiration table in addition to earnings and valuation guidance assumptions. The information provided in the supplemental package is unaudited and includes non-GAAP measures, and there can be no assurance that the information will not vary from the final information in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022. Regency may, but assumes no obligation to, update information in the supplemental package from time to time.Non-GAAP DisclosureWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes.We do not consider non-GAAP measures an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, rather they supplement GAAP measures by providing additional information we believe to be useful to our shareholders. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they may exclude significant expense and income items that are required by GAAP to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, they reflect the exercise of management’s judgment about which expense and income items are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures we use to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon in evaluating the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of the Company.Nareit FFO is a commonly used measure of REIT performance, which the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) defines as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains on sale and impairments of real estate, net of tax, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Regency computes Nareit FFO for all periods presented in accordance with Nareit's definition. Since Nareit FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and gains on sales and impairments of real estate, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in percent leased, rental rates, operating costs, acquisition and development activities, and financing costs. This provides a perspective of the Company’s financial performance not immediately apparent from net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Thus, Nareit FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of the Company's operating performance, which does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP; and, therefore, should not be considered a substitute measure of cash flows from operations. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders to Nareit FFO.Core Operating Earnings is an additional performance measure that excludes from Nareit FFO: (i) transaction related income or expenses; (ii) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; (iii) certain non-cash components of earnings derived from above and below market rent amortization, straight-line rents, and amortization of mark-to-market of debt adjustments; and (iv) other amounts as they occur. The Company provides a reconciliation of Net Income to Nareit FFO to Core Operating Earnings.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial, business, legal or other outcomes including business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Regency’s future events, developments, or financial or operational performance or results such as our 2022 Guidance, are “forward-looking statements” made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “guidance,” and other similar language. However, the absence of these or similar words or expressions does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. While we believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable when made, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance these expectations will be attained, and it is possible actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Our operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, those risk factors described in our SEC filings. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings and submissions to the SEC. If any of the events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and Regency undertakes no duty to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law. These risks and events include, without limitation:Risk Factors Related to Pandemics or other Health CrisesPandemics or other health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition, the profitability of our properties, and our access to the capital markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Risk Factors Related to Operating Retail-Based Shopping CentersEconomic and market conditions may adversely affect the retail industry and consequently reduce our revenues and cash flow, and increase our operating expenses. Shifts in retail trends, sales, and delivery methods between brick and mortar stores, e-commerce, home delivery, and curbside pick-up may adversely impact our revenues and cash flows. Changing economic and retail market conditions in geographic areas where our properties are concentrated may reduce our revenues and cash flow. In addition, labor challenges and supply delays and shortages due to a variety of macroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressures, could affect the retail industry. Our success depends on the continued presence and success of our “anchor” tenants. A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from smaller “shop space” tenants and our net income may be adversely impacted if our smaller shop tenants are not successful. We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. Many of our costs and expenses associated with operating our properties may remain constant or increase, even if our lease income decreases. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may have a negative effect on us.Risk Factors Related to Real Estate InvestmentsOur real estate assets may decline in value and be subject to impairment losses which may reduce our net income. We face risks associated with development, redevelopment and expansion of properties. We face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. We face risks associated with the acquisition of properties. We may be unable to sell properties when desired because of market conditions. Changes in tax laws could impact our acquisition or disposition of real estate.Risk Factors Related to the Environment Affecting Our PropertiesClimate change may adversely impact our properties directly, and may lead to additional compliance obligations and costs as well as additional taxes and fees. Geographic concentration of our properties makes our business more vulnerable to natural disasters, severe weather conditions and climate change. Costs of environmental remediation may impact our financial performance and reduce our cash flow.Risk Factors Related to Corporate MattersAn increased focus on metrics and reporting relating to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the insurance coverage on our properties may subject us to loss of capital and revenue on those properties. Failure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our business and operations. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of tenant or employee personal, financial or other data or of Regency’s proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.Risk Factors Related to Our Partnerships and Joint VenturesWe do not have voting control over all of the properties owned in our co-investment partnerships and joint ventures, so we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. The termination of our partnerships may adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and our ability to make distributions to stock and unit holders.Risk Factors Related to Funding Strategies and Capital StructureOur ability to sell properties and fund acquisitions and developments may be adversely impacted by higher market capitalization rates and lower NOI at our properties which may dilute earnings. We depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our debt financing may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Covenants in our debt agreements may restrict our operating activities and adversely affect our financial condition. Increases in interest rates would cause our borrowing costs to rise and negatively impact our results of operations. Hedging activity may expose us to risks, including the risks that a counterparty will not perform and that the hedge will not yield the economic benefits we anticipate, which may adversely affect us. The interest rates on our Unsecured Credit facilities as well as on our variable rate mortgages and interest rate swaps might change based on changes to the method in which LIBOR or its replacement rate is determined.Risk Factors Related to the Market Price for Our SecuritiesChanges in economic and market conditions may adversely affect the market price of our securities. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates.Risk Factors Relating to the Company’s Qualification as a REITIf the Company fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. Certain foreign stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock if we do not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs may have a negative effect on us. Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.Risk Factors Related to the Company’s Common StockRestrictions on the ownership of the Company’s capital stock to preserve its REIT status may delay or prevent a change in control. The issuance of the Company's capital stock may delay or prevent a change in control. Ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.Christy McElroy904 598 7616ChristyMcElroy@regencycenters.com]"

SLG bagged a lease for 347,474 square feet of space at One Madison Avenue in New York with investment management firm — Franklin Templeton. With this, the tenant will occupy the entire 11th through 22nd floors in the tower portion of the building for 15 years.SL Green is witnessing healthy demand for One Madison and the latest lease follows the 328,000-square-foot lease with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and the 56,000-square-foot lease with Chelsea Piers Fitness at the property. With these leasing activities, this development that is on schedule for completion in November 2023, is now 55% leased.Per Marc Holliday, chairman and CEO of SL Green, “This lease and the earlier IBM transaction are the second and third largest new leases signed in Manhattan in 2022 and are validation as to the exceptional quality of the building design.”One Madison Avenue is a 1.4-million-square-foot Midtown South office tower adjacent to Madison Square Park. Along with Chelsea Piers, the property’s amenities are presently expected to include a 13,000-square-foot upscale restaurant, 10,000-square-foot artisanal dining market and 7,000-square-foot tenant-exclusive lounge with direct elevator access to a 10,000-square-foot rooftop deck. With an advantageous location, this well-amenetized property is poised to lure tenants.Office-space demand in the upcoming period is likely to be driven by de-densification to allow higher square footage per office worker and the need for high-quality, well-amenetized office properties. SL Green is well-positioned to benefit from the emerging trend, given its well-located properties and the ability to offer top-notch amenities at recently-developed office buildings.In fact, despite the negative effects of the pandemic-borne job losses and the remote-working dynamics that have been hindering the U.S. office real estate sector, SL Green signed 76 office leases for its Manhattan office portfolio spanning 1,009,811 square feet during the first half of 2022. The average lease term was 8.8 years for the Manhattan office leases signed during this period.Nevertheless, the continuation of remote working, the rising supply of office properties and interest rate hikes are concerns.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have declined 11.4% over the past month compared with the industry’s fall of 15.3%.

265,69126b05-b816-369e-9beb-daee29016bbe,SLG,2022-10-01,Here's Why Investors Should Retain SL Green (SLG) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-sl-120012283.html,1664539212.0,STORY,"['SLG', 'SLG-PI']","[SL Green Realty Corp. SLG, Manhattan’s largest office landlord, is well-poised to benefit from its portfolio of high-quality office properties located in the high-barrier to entry real estate market of New York amid the recovering office real-estate market.After a dismal environment in the office real-estate market, office real estate investment trusts (REITs), including SL Green, are likely to benefit from a combination of office-using job growth, higher space utilization and expansion of technology, financial and media companies.With a gradual return of the workforce to offices, SLG has been witnessing robust leasing activity. It signed 76 office leases for its Manhattan office portfolio spanning 1,009,811 square feet during the first half of 2022. This is likely to boost SLG’s occupancy levels and rental revenues in the upcoming period.  Moreover, its diversified tenant base with a strong credit profile lowers the risk associated with dependency on single-industry tenants and assures stable rental revenues for the company.SL Green follows an opportunistic investment policy to enhance its overall portfolio quality. Through this, it divests the mature and non-core assets and utilizes the proceeds to fund development projects and share buybacks.This September, it entered into an agreement to dispose of its 414,317 square feet of vacant office leasehold condominium units at 885 Third Avenue, popularly known as “The Lipstick Building,” to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for $300.4 million. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions.SL Green also enjoys solid balance-sheet strength with ample liquidity. It exited the second quarter of 2022 with $1.3 billion of liquidity and a fixed charge coverage for the trailing 12 months of 3.03X. This gives its enough financial flexibility to bank on future growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors, and SLG remains committed to that. In December 2021, it increased its annual ordinary dividend by 2.5%, resulting in an annual dividend of $3.73 per share. Also, in the past five years, SLG has increased its dividend five times and has a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 2.60%, which seems encouraging.However, a rise in the supply of office properties in SL Green’s markets and intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants, limits SLG’s ability to increase rents and/or backfill tenant move-outs and vacancies.A majority of SL Green’s operations is concentrated in midtown Manhattan, NY. Consequently, its concentration of assets in this particular geographic region makes it susceptible to the economic conditions prevailing in New York City.Also, a hike in interest rates is likely to increase borrowing costs, affecting SLG’s ability to purchase or develop real estate.Shares of SLG, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have lost 15.2% in the quarter-to-date period compared with the industry’s decline of 10.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are SBA Communications SBAC, Extra Space Storage EXR and Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts XHR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The proper maintenance of water mains will ensure adequate water supply, reduce service disruptions and increase water flows for firefighting.The Pennsylvanian unit has been upgrading and maintaining its water and wastewater infrastructure by replacing old water mains methodically and has invested nearly $373 million in 2021 for infrastructure upgrades. Proper infrastructure maintenance allows the company to efficiently serve its 2.4 million customers.Upgrades Essential for Water IndustryA substantial portion of the U.S. water and wastewater infrastructure has aged and is nearing the end of its effective service life. Miles of aging pipelines essentially require repair and upgrade to maintain quality water service. A delay in repair could cause frequent disruptions in the 24x7 supply of potable water and sewer services.Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, investments of $473 billion and $271 billion are necessary to maintain and expand drinking water and wastewater pipelines, respectively, to meet the demand over the next 20 years. Water infrastructure, like storage tanks and water purifying units, needs maintenance at proper intervals.Utilities Making Systematic InvestmentGiven the above-mentioned scenario, it is evident that systematic investment to upgrade and maintain the old infrastructure and make provisions for adding new infrastructure will assist the operators in meeting the rising customer demand. Water utilities are making systematic investments to replace and upgrade their aging water infrastructure. The U.S. government is also providing funds for the upgrade and maintenance of the aging infrastructure.American Water plans to invest $13-$14 billion between 2022 and 2026, and $28-$32 billion between 2022 and 2031 to upgrade and strengthen the existing water and wastewater infrastructure.

The plan, filed today (Sept. 30, 2022) with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, calls for battery storage facilities to be developed in Grant and Wood counties, alongside two previously approved Alliant Energy solar arrays.“Just like the batteries you’d find in a cell phone, laptop or car, the storage systems we’re developing can deliver energy to power our lives when we need it,” said David de Leon, president of Alliant Energy’s Wisconsin energy company. “As we transition to cleaner, more cost-effective renewable energy, the added capacity and unique capabilities of these energy storage solutions will strengthen our generation portfolio, improve reliability and help meet customer needs. It’s just one more way we’re delivering on our purpose-driven strategy.”The Grant County battery project (100 MW/400 MWh), located at the Grant County Solar site in the town of Potosi, could store enough energy to power over 100,000 Wisconsin homes for four hours. The Wood County battery project (75 MW/300 MWh), located at the Wood County Solar site in the town of Saratoga, could store enough energy to power over 80,000 Wisconsin homes for four hours. Alliant Energy has worked closely with these communities over the past several years to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of the company’s renewable energy investments.“Our mission is to deliver the energy solutions and exceptional service that customers and communities count on – safely, efficiently and responsibly,” said de Leon. “As a leader in renewable energy generation, Alliant Energy is well-positioned to accelerate the development of this energy storage capacity in Wisconsin. For customers, this means greater reliability and long-term affordability as we transition toward a cleaner energy future.”Story continuesAlliant Energy is following the plan outlined in its Clean Energy Blueprint to bring clean, reliable and affordable energy to customers for years to come. The plan includes constructing nearly 1,100 MW of utility-scale solar energy at 12 sites across Wisconsin. The added flexibility created by battery energy storage solutions will diversify and complement Alliant Energy’s generation portfolio while increasing customer access to safe, reliable energy even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.Pending PSCW approval, Alliant Energy plans to begin construction on these battery projects in 2023 and expects them to be in service by Fall 2025.

The data were presented in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) annual meeting in Chicago and will support the submission of a new Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by early 2023.""Our presentations at AAO demonstrate that aflibercept 8 mg 12- and 16-week dosing regimens have achieved a high bar, sustaining improvements in visual acuity and anatomic measures of retinal fluid across 48 weeks in patients with diabetic macular edema and wet age-related macular degeneration,"" said George D. Yancopoulos, M.D., Ph.D., President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron, and a principal inventor of aflibercept. ""These results were all achieved in patients who were rapidly initiated on extended dosing intervals with the vast majority not requiring regimen modification. Altogether, the pivotal data support aflibercept 8 mg as providing a longer duration of action while maintaining a safety profile similar to EYLEA.""As presented at AAO, the PHOTON trial in DME and the PULSAR trial in wAMD both met the same primary endpoint. Aflibercept 8 mg demonstrated non-inferiority in vision gains in both the 12- and 16-week dosing regimens after initial monthly doses at 48 weeks compared to an EYLEA 8-week dosing regimen. Furthermore, 91% and 89% of DME patients and 79% and 77% of wAMD patients respectively randomized to 12- and 16-week dosing maintained those intervals through 48 weeks. The safety of aflibercept 8 mg was similar to EYLEA in both trials, and consistent with the known safety profile of EYLEA from previous clinical trials. Comparing aflibercept 8 mg to EYLEA, ocular adverse events occurred in 31% versus 28% in PHOTON and 38% versus 39% in PULSAR, and there were no cases of retinal vasculitis, occlusive retinitis or endophthalmitis in either trial.Story continuesData from PHOTON and PULSAR were first shared in early September, and the full AAO presentations are available on the Regeneron website.Aflibercept 8 mg is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Bayer AG. In the U.S., Regeneron maintains exclusive rights to EYLEA and aflibercept 8 mg. Bayer has licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside of the U.S., where the companies share equally the profits from sales of EYLEA.Aflibercept 8 mg is investigational, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Aflibercept 8 mg Trial Program  PHOTON in DME (N=658) and PULSAR in wAMD (N=1,009) are double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials that are being conducted in multiple centers globally. In both trials, patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups to receive either: aflibercept 8 mg every 12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg every 16 weeks, or EYLEA every 8 weeks.Patients treated with aflibercept 8 mg in both trials had 3 initial monthly doses, and patients treated with EYLEA received 5 initial monthly doses in PHOTON and 3 in PULSAR. In the first year, patients in the aflibercept 8 mg groups could have their dosing intervals shortened down to an every 8-week interval if protocol-defined criteria for disease progression were observed. Intervals could not be extended until the second year of the study, with those results still to be assessed. Patients in all EYLEA groups maintained a fixed 8-week dosing regimen throughout their participation in the trials.The lead sponsors of the trials were Regeneron for PHOTON and Bayer for PULSAR.About DME and wAMD  DME is a common complication in eyes of people living with diabetes. DME occurs when high levels of blood sugar lead to damaged blood vessels in the eye that leak fluid into the macula. This can lead to vision loss and, in some cases, blindness. Of the nearly 28 million American adults living with diabetes, an estimated 1.2 million have DME.wAMD is a retinal disease that may affect people as they age. It occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow and leak fluid under the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision and seeing fine detail. This fluid can damage and scar the macula, which can cause vision loss. An estimated 1.1 million Americans have wAMD, and this number is expected to double by 2050.IMPORTANT EYLEA SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATIONSINDICATIONS  EYLEA® (aflibercept) Injection 2 mg (0.05 mL) is indicated for the treatment of patients with Neovascular (Wet) Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).CONTRAINDICATIONSEYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections, active intraocular inflammation, or known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of the excipients in EYLEA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSIntravitreal injections, including those with EYLEA, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately. Intraocular inflammation has been reported with the use of EYLEA.Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with EYLEA. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with VEGF inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately.There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including EYLEA. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the EYLEA group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies.ADVERSE REACTIONSSerious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with EYLEA and the associated eye examinations. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.For more information, please see full Prescribing Information.About Regeneron  Regeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents, develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

276,b6b2b8f2-2408-3539-ac3e-8811a78fd71c,AMP,2022-10-01,7 Long-Term Sleeper Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Wakes Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-long-term-sleeper-stocks-190206377.html,1664305326,STORY,"['AMP', 'AQNU', 'OPI', 'KSCP', 'VALE']","[Generally speaking, the equities sector represents the collective valuation of all publicly available information about exchange-listed companies, making the notion of long-term sleeper stocks to buy a rather risky concept. Nevertheless, individual investors can’t be all places at all times. Occasionally, a few compelling ideas slip through the cracks, presenting upside opportunities for intrepid investors.Before we get started, readers should realize that the below long-term sleeper stocks to buy align with the higher-risk, higher-reward spectrum of market ideas. Fundamentally, they require a belief in a thesis that may not have materialized, but very well could over time. Therefore, the reward potential is quite high for these long-term bets.On the other hand, no guarantees exist that the presented theses will pan out as advertised. Therefore, investors should approach these long-term sleeper stocks to buy with a healthy dose of cautious optimism.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsKSCPKnightscope$2.53SUNLSunlight Financial$2.56OPIOffice Properties Income$14.09VALEVale$12.54SBSWSibanye Stillwater$8.37AMPAmeriprise Financial$250.97AQNAlgonquin Power &amp; Utilities$11.69Knightscope (KSCP)An image of a robot hand pointing toward a data graphSource: Have a nice day Photo/ShutterstockA security camera and robotics firm, Knightscope (NASDAQ:KSCP) specializes in autonomous security robots or ASRs. Effectively functioning as patrol mechanisms, these robots can help keep the peace while relaying problematic incidents to law enforcement agencies. Better yet, ASRs can perform these tasks without the involvement of human intermediaries.According to the company’s website, Knightscope’s security robots have already logged over one million hours of service with paying clients. Typically, these partners include parking complexes, shopping malls, hospitals and corporate complexes.Fundamentally, the beauty of the Knightscope business model is the reduction of human-to-human safety interactions, which can create ugly tensions. Rather, these non-human ASRs can potentially deescalate dangerous situations. If the initial interactions fail to bring about desired outcomes, then law enforcement can step in.Story continuesNevertheless, Wall Street doesn’t appear to recognize the long-term potential for Knightscope, making KSCP one of the long-term sleeper stocks to buy.Sunlight Financial (SUNL)A laptop, pencil, pair of eyeglasses, and many coins rest on a wooden table.Source: ShutterstockOn the surface, Sunlight Financial (NYSE:SUNL) presents a framework that should be relevant and desirable because of contemporary ideologies. Partnering with contractors nationwide, Sunlight Financial helps them offer homeowners “innovative, affordable loans for modern home upgrades.” Specifically, Sunlight empowers people to acquire residential solar systems.Still, given the pressures of the moment, Wall Street takes a dim view of SUNL stock. Indeed, shares slipped more than 44% on a year-to-date basis through the Sept. 26 session. And while revenue increased on a year-over-year basis in the company’s second quarter of 2022, Sunlight’s net income for the company’s most recent earnings report came out to $4.1 million. This figure slipped 21% against the year-ago period.Nevertheless, because of factors such as climate change and historically high rates of inflation, many homeowners will likely transition to solar energy solutions. Over time, that’s going to help Sunlight, making SUNL one of the long-term sleeper stocks to buy I’m watching closely.Office Properties Income (OPI)Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room.Source: GaudiLab / ShutterstockWhile some market ideas for long-term sleeper stocks to buy seems obvious, others – such as Office Properties Income (NASDAQ:OPI) – present an understandable reason why they fail to attract the Street. Office Properties is a real estate investment trust (or REIT) that focuses on “owning, operating and leasing buildings primarily leased to single tenants and those with high credit quality characteristics like government entities.”Of course, the massive work-from-home pivot stemming from the coronavirus pandemic essentially squashed office culture. Accordingly, OPI stock has lost nearly 44% year-to-date. Moreover, the nearer-term negative momentum presents many anxieties. On Sept. 26, OPI dropped 8% in a single day. Over the trailing month, shares fell 20%. These performance statistics indicate that the Street believes work from home is here to stay.But it might not be. Not only are upper management teams statistically winning the war in getting their employees back into the office, they also enjoy ultimate leverage. After all, they sign the checks, meaning the employees don’t hire themselves. With that, the normal work culture may return, which could bode well for OPI stock.Vale (VALE)construction workers point at mining equipment in the near distanceSource: ShutterstockDue to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the critical resources sector became hostage to dangerous military ambitions. One cynical benefit is that companies providing said resources typically perform well in such times. After all, turmoil in supply chains raise commodity prices, which improve profitability for miners who can export their goods efficiently.Accordingly, Vale (NYSE:VALE) represents one of the long-term sleeper stocks I’m watching closely. Since the start of this year, VALE has dropped 9% at the time of writing. That said, I think the tides may be about to turn for this Brazilian metals and mining firm.That’s mainly because Vale represents the world’s largest producer of iron ore and nickel. The latter metal offers substantial relevance as it’s a key ingredient of lithium-ion batteries that are especially important for the production of vehicles. EVs present a potential solution for the present energy crisis. Over time, the electrification of mobility can help countries wean off hydrocarbons.Granted, this dynamic will take some time to play out. However, the motif here is long-term sleeper stocks to buy. Interestingly enough, Gurufocus.com labels Vale as modestly undervalued. Currently, the company features a forward price-earnings ratio of 4.1-times, well below the industry median of 8.8-times.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)a construction worker looks on as an excavator gets to work in a mineSource: ShutterstockBecause of the seesaw effect of this year’s economic turbulence, resource firms like Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) suffered incredible volatility. Since the beginning of January, SBSW shares fell almost 35%. Over the trailing month, they’re down over 14%. Clearly, the Street doesn’t think much of Sibanye. Nevertheless, it’s arguably one of the long-term sleeper stocks to buy.Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, Sibanye garnered much attention for its gold production. Moving forward, though, the company might attract investors for its platinum group metals, specifically palladium. Currently, Russia represents the leading palladium exporter. However, South Africa – Sibanye’s home market – is a palladium powerhouse in its own right. Therefore, South Africa’s generally friendly posture to the west may be critical for SBSW.For now, most equity investors ignore SBSW. However, it’s important to realize that per TipRanks, Sibanye commands a consensus strong buy rating. Out of five covering analysts, four rate it a buy while one gives it a sell rating.Ameriprise Financial (AMP)Source: ShutterstockA finance-related enterprise, Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) provides financial planning products and services, including wealth management, asset management, insurance, annuities, and estate planning. Under the current paradigm, fears of an economic slowdown – even a recession – has many folks on edge. Thus, it’s understandable why the Street tends to ignore AMP stock. Shares of this company are down nearly 17% year-to-date.On the other hand, Ameriprise could very well be one of the long-term sleeper stocks to buy. The bullish thesis comes down to an expected monetary framework pivot. Under an inflationary cycle, the subsequent erosion of dollar purchasing power means that investors have two options with their money: spend it or invest it. Otherwise, keeping dollars dormant is likely to produce wealth erosion over time.In a deflationary cycle, purchasing power rises – as has happened recently. Therefore, an incentive exists to do nothing but stay in cash. That’s an extraordinarily difficult circumstance to navigate, meaning that Ameriprise’s expertise should attract retail investors, who are likely to stumble trading on their own in a deflationary environment.Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (AQN)multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skylineSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.comIf you consider some of the stronger players during this post-pandemic new normal, you’ll notice that utility firms tend to perform well. Essentially, this sector enjoys a permanent baseline demand profile. Yes, economic circumstances will always impact consumption behaviors and patterns. However, in a modern economy, households won’t be able to survive long without critical services. (The lights and heat generally need to stay on, regardless of the economy).Thus, this environment is one that favors a company like Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (NYSE:AQN). This Canadian renewable energy and regulated utility conglomerate provides natural gas, water and electricity generation, transmission and distribution utility services. That said, AQN stock is down 17% year-to-date, as the company’s underlying performance has lagged. While broader economic pressures present a challenging environment for Algonquin, it’s one of the long-term sleeper stocks to buy, in my view.Admittedly, the company’s net loss of $33 million in Q2 2022 – down conspicuously from net income of $103 million in the year-ago quarter – presents a major distraction. That said, over the long-term, folks can’t ignore their utility bills. Thus, I think Algonquin’s forward-looking prospects remain bright.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

Here are just a few reasons to operate a more sustainable business:Reputation: Millennial business buyers and talent consider a company's commitment to environmental sustainability as an important factor in deciding to move forward with business deals and job offers, according to research by organizations like Deloitte.Regulatory frameworks: Governments and industries are implementing regulations to address dwindling natural resources and growing greenhouse gas emissions.Cultural shifts: The world is working in a new way. With the shift to hybrid work, organizations are reimagining their workplaces. Also consumers have become more conscious of how their behaviors impact climate change and we believe that may influence their spending and investment behaviors.Efficiency: Sustainable practices often help reduce the use of energy and other resources, which can lead to cost savings.All of this has led to more organizations committing to sustainable practices - such as using renewable energy, reusing and recycling equipment, and making carbon reduction pledges. Setting a goal is one thing, but achieving that goal is what matters. For most organizations - even though sustainability cracked Gartner's CEO survey top-ten list of priorities for 2022-2023 - it is still one of many priorities, and the path to getting there isn't always clear.We believe the path to mitigating the disruptions of climate change and achieving zero net emissions is going to include technology and innovation. We can see evidence of this across different industries - automotive with electric cars, the public sector's push for clean energy infrastructure, carbon capture, and the growth of lab-grown meats in the food industry, to name a few examples.A Cloud-managed network can help provide a path to sustainability for any organization. Organizations across different industries are relying on advanced technologies to drive digital transformation and accelerate innovation. At the backbone of this is cloud-based internet infrastructure. Cloud technology enables industries to leverage global networks, seamlessly connecting hardware and software. This provides the on-demand processing power, data storage, and analytics needed to scale computing - delivering the innovations needed to drive productivity and efficiency.Story continuesCisco Meraki has a culture of pushing boundaries and innovating to make IT more intuitive, faster, and smarter for our customers. We believe applying these same principles can enable our customers to leverage digital innovations that are good for business and for the environment.Smart SpacesBy using Cloud native and AI technology to intelligently manage spaces, Cisco Meraki and our technology partner ecosystem can help customers create and maintain smart, healthy, and sustainable spaces that can help improve business productivity and performance. When cloud-first solutions enable building controls to be automated, efficiency may go up, while energy use and operating costs may go down, due to better management of functions like heating, cooling, and lighting.Our intuitive IoT solutions can automatically adjust workspace conditions, for example by switching off WiFi and other Power over Ethernet devices outside of business hours, or by preventing water leaks and goods spoilage with temperature and humidity sensors. Cloud technology makes it easier to gather data across different devices, platforms and geographically dispersed areas to conduct cross domain analysis. The more an organization can access insights from their own data, the more overall value they can derive to manage costs, maximize resources, and improve customer and employee experiences.Embracing Hybrid WorkOur new way of working has created an opportunity for organizations and their employees to reduce the carbon footprint of day-to-day business. Consolidating office space and equipment, lowering energy and water usage, and reducing the number of vehicles on the road through less commuting time can all help the environment. But making that work seamless for organizations struggling with dated technology and talent shortages isn't easy. The Meraki Cloud Platform enables zero touch deployment that works in concert with smart cameras and IoT sensors to provide a unified experience that extends the capabilities of IT, security, facilities, and operations teams.Building a sustainable future for allAs more organizations voluntarily make climate action pledges and move toward sustainable practices, they can look to Cloud managed technology to help them meet their goals. Whether the motivation is out of concern for the climate or a company's bottom line, there is an opportunity for Cloud technology to help lead the way with a unified experience. When everything is connected and you have end-to-end visibility across devices and domains, your IT, facilities, physical security and operations departments can all leverage efficiencies and take small actions that can make a positive impact on the environment.View original content here.Cisco Systems Inc., Friday, September 30, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/718311/The-Path-to-Sustainability-Travels-Through-the-Cloud]"
278,3ddd38e9-3666-3eb3-b955-f41f75381dfd,CSCO,2022-10-01,Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Could Be A Buy For Its Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-nasdaq-csco-could-132803766.html,1664544483,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Cisco Systems investors that purchase the stock on or after the 4th of October will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.38 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.52 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Cisco Systems has a trailing yield of 3.7% on the current share price of $40.57. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Cisco Systems's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Cisco Systems can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Cisco Systems paid out 53% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 49% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's positive to see that Cisco Systems's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Cisco Systems, with earnings per share up 8.4% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Cisco Systems has increased its dividend at approximately 20% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Cisco Systems for the upcoming dividend? While earnings per share growth has been modest, Cisco Systems's dividend payouts are around an average level; without a sharp change in earnings we feel that the dividend is likely somewhat sustainable. Pleasingly the company paid out a conservatively low percentage of its free cash flow. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Cisco Systems today.Wondering what the future holds for Cisco Systems?
