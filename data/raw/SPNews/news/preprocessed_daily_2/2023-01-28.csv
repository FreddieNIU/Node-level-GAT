The best banks for travelers don’t charge foreign transaction fees for purchases made on debit cards abroad and they place a special emphasis on security, fraud prevention and alerts.Pick a bank with a reputation for good customer service — variables like language barriers and time zones make emergencies even more challenging when you’re out of the country.Also, don’t assume you’ll have to pay for these perks. Many of the best banks for travelers charge no fees and have no account minimums. In fact, some pay a competitive yield.Finally, since financial regulations vary so much from place to place, most U.S. banks don’t operate many branches in other countries. That means you’ll want to choose a bank with a robust and reliable app that can let you perform most of the tasks you might otherwise do in person.Charles SchwabThe Schwab Bank Investor Checking account is worth a look even if you don’t travel. Not only are there no fees or account minimums, but Charles Schwab pays its checking customers a 0.45% yield.For those who do leave the country, the account is linked to the Schwab Bank Visa Platinum debit card and all its many international perks. There are no foreign transaction fees and millions of merchants accept it in more than 200 countries and territories.The card gives you beefed-up security abroad with extra features like travel notifications, two-way fraud text alerts, account and transaction alerts and card lock/unlock.Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?Finally, you get unlimited monthly rebates for ATM cash withdrawal fees no matter where in the world you pick up the charges. If you need assistance while you’re on the road, Schwab won J.D. Power awards four years straight for customer service on its checking accounts.Capital OneThe 360 Checking Account makes Capital One a top contender for travelers looking for a bank that caters to their needs. Forbes cites the average foreign transaction fee as between 1%-5% of the price per purchase made overseas. Capital One joins Schwab in charging zero. According to Motley Fool, it’s one of the only major banks that does not charge a foreign transaction fee on any of its credit or debit offerings.Capital One lets you lock and unlock your Mastercard debit card from the mobile app and delivers real-time spending alerts. There are no fees to open, maintain and use a 360 Checking account and Capital One doesn’t require any minimums. Also, the bank does not charge any fees for using ATMs in other countries, but it ranks below Schwab because it does not refund fees that ATM owners often charge.BettermentKnown chiefly for its robo-advisor services, Betterment also offers a checking account with a lot to offer international travelers. You should consider Betterment only if you’re comfortable with a mobile-forward banking experience with no physical locations.Not only does the bank charge no fees of its own — including overdraft fees — but it reimburses 100% of any foreign transaction fees and ATM fees you incur anywhere in the world. In addition, you can change your PIN or lock your card from the mobile app and your money is FDIC insured just as it would be with a traditional bank.While it doesn’t pay a yield like a Schwab account, it has the unique advantage of earning cashback rewards at Costco, Adidas and thousands of other brands just like a credit card.HSBCHSBC is an outlier because its premier-only checking accounts require high account minimums — $75,000 in total deposits or investments. Alternatively, you can keep an account in good standing with at least $5,000 in recurring monthly direct deposits. If not, you’ll incur a $50 monthly fee. That’s $600 a year for a debit card — you could do better with several high-end travel rewards credit cards.However, if you do keep high balances or receive large regular deposits, HSBC Premier Checking has a lot to offer travelers beyond just its lack of foreign transaction fees. Premier status earns you priority service and emergency financial support at HSBC locations worldwide. If they lose their wallets, customers can access up to $10,000 in emergency cash in U.S. or local currency. Finally, you can use HSBC ATMs across the globe for free and receive international wire transfers at no cost.More From GOBankingRatesExperts: Here's How Much You Should Have in Your Checking AccountExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023Here's How To Build a 6-Month Emergency FundThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Best Banks for International Travelers]"

His company, Strandway LLC, was hoping to buy a piece of technology from a US manufacturer: an oscilloscope scanner typically used to test electronics.In reality, Wetzky did not really exist. It was a pseudonym used by Boris Livshits, a Russian citizen accused of posing as a legitimate businessman so he could smuggle high tech electronics and semiconductors out of the US.The devices were shipped in April last year to a quiet town in America’s suburbia, Merrimack in New Hampshire. From there, they were allegedly picked up by Israeli-American Alexey Brayman, who repackaged the technology, tore up the invoices and added fake export documentation before sending them to Europe, US court filings state.Months later, another Russian citizen, Vadim Konoshchenok, was stopped on the border between Estonia and Russia. In his car, agents found 35 semiconductors, many of them US origin, which he had been trying to conceal and carry across the border, according to a US indictment.Last months, US officials accused Livshits, Brayman and Konoshchenok, along with three other Russians and an American, of running a smuggling ring dedicated to squirrelling technology out of America to Moscow, some of which could have been used for developing nuclear or hypersonic weapons.A lawyer for Brayman told CNN in December he was entitled to the “presumption of innocence”. He was released on bail. Livshits is believed to be at large. Konoshchenok is awaiting extradition from Estonia.The case is thought to be just the tip of the iceberg. The dark market for semiconductors and other high tech parts has been growing, fuelled by shortages in China, sanctions imposed on Vladimir Putin’s Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, and US restrictions on the sale of high-tech chips to China.A robotic arm moves a 300 mm silicon semiconductor wafer inside a sorting machine in a cleanroom at the Globalfoundries Inc. semiconductor fabrication plant in Dresden, Germany, on Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2022. As the US has implemented unexpectedly strict rules on the transfer of semiconductor technology to China, the EU has paved the way for chipmakers to receive unprecedented state funds to build production sites as part of its EU Chips Act. Photographer: Liesa Johannssen/Bloomberg - Liesa Johannssen/Bloomberg“Given the sanctions against Russia and China, there is going to be an increase in the grey market, and black market and illegal channels,"" Ron Black, chief executive of semiconductor technology company Codasip, says. “We have to prepare for this.”Story continuesThe black market for technology between the West and East has a long history. During the Cold War, Soviet defectors admitted to using intelligence agents to infiltrate American and British semiconductor companies in an effort to steal technology.After the fall of the Iron Curtain, covert trade in Western technology continued though concerns shifted towards Chinese technology theft.However, the war in Ukraine and tensions between the West and China have elevated the issue from a commercial concern to a strategic threat.Illicit black market trading and smuggling, where semiconductors are transferred or stolen in breach of sanctions, sits alongside a well-established “grey market” for chips, where resellers trade semiconductors into third countries without the permission of the manufacturer, or use them in alternative applications in breach of contract.Getting an accurate value for these illicit markets is difficult, but between the black market and counterfeit chips, it is estimated to cost the industry billions of pounds each year.Experts compare the problem to the trade of conflict diamonds in West Africa during the 1990s.“It starts off with pure economic reasons, unofficial channels selling diamonds or other luxury goods cheaper than official channels,” says Black. “Unfortunately, semiconductors can be used for multiple illicit purposes, it’s not just a cheaper washing machine to wash clothes, it's purchases to take the chips out and put them in a missile.”Last year, the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) studied dozens of pieces of Russian military equipment and found multiple US, European and Japanese semiconductors that had been repurposed in weaponry.Transceivers produced by Dutch company Nexperia were discovered in a nuclear-capable Kh-101 cruise missile. Parts from US company Texas Instruments were found in Russia’s KUB-BLA “kamikaze” drones. Technology from US company Analog Devices was uncovered in military radios and jamming systems.There is no indication the Western companies knew their technology would end up in Russian military equipment. Nexperia, Texas Instruments and Analog Devices all denied doing business with Russia and suggested unauthorised reselling or contract breaking by third parties was behind Rusi’s findings.It is also is possible the devices were smuggled into the country, brought in before the conflict began, or prised out of consumer electronics and re-used.An inside look at the circuitry of the Zarya Guidance computer used on a 9M727 cruise missile, containing US-made parts - RusiSuch efforts are monitored by Russia’s secret service, which vets parts acquired from the West for backdoors.“Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they have expended a significant amount of military equipment en masse,” Joe Byrne, a research fellow at Rusi, tells The Telegraph. “Western produced components are critical to those systems.”“This goes back to the Cold War. Even when Putin was an agent in Dresden, he was operating around people tasked with stealing technology. It has long been part of Russia’s plans.”Last year a woman was arrested while travelling from Macau to China with a fake baby bump allegedly containing more than 200 semiconductor chips, Bloomberg reported, in one of the most eye-catching examples of the underground trade.As well as black market dealings, there is the “grey market”: semiconductor companies may sell microchips or technology to resellers in good faith, before they are moved and shifted through a web of shell companies and traders in jurisdictions with little oversight, rather than used as stated in their contracts.In its study of Russia’s illicit semiconductor supply chain, Rusi found components were often moved to trading hubs such as Hong Kong, before being taken on by Chinese resellers and transferred into Russia.“Procurement agents may set up front companies in Hong Kong or Malaysia, and then transship them to Russia,” says Byrne.Black says there are ways the industry can try to tackle the illicit chip trade. Batch or lot numbers on chips can be easily faked or altered, but semiconductor companies can put unique identifiers on each chip, allowing companies to “investigate to see if customers are in breach of your legal restrictions”.Byrne, the Rusi research fellow, adds there are open source and artificial intelligence tools, which track shipping data and company filings, that can be used to flag suspect orders.The problem seems only likely to mount as restrictions on trade tighten. US sanctions have made it increasingly difficult for Russia to access semiconductors, while White House officials are now pushing for further restrictions on China.In particular, they are lobbying the Netherlands to introduce export controls that will block advanced chip making equipment from being sent to China.DONETSK OBLAST, UKRAINE - JANUARY 26: Ukrainian servicemen take cover as they fire a mortar load on the Donbass frontline as military mobility continues within the Russian-Ukrainian war, on January 26, 2023. (Photo by Mustafa Ciftci/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) - Mustafa Ciftci/Anadolu AgencyThe Semiconductor Industry Association, which includes some of the world’s biggest chip companies and distributors, says its members are “committed to combating illicit chip diversion”.The body said earlier this month: “The ubiquity of chips in a range of consumer products makes controlling these items an issue of magnitude. Most weapons systems are designed with chips that have a multitude of civilian uses, the same that can be found in cars, laptops, and home appliances.”A Nexperia spokesman condemned Russia’s “illegal invasion of Ukraine” and said the company complies with international sanctions, “which we fully support, therefore, we have no Russian customers and do not sell to Russia even through distributors.”“In the event that it becomes known to us that any of our distributors violate sanctions, our policy is to immediately cease all further deliveries and cease working with that organisation. While we have put in place the necessary compliance processes, such third-party behaviour cannot always be controlled or prevented by us.”A Texas Instruments spokesman said the company did not sell components in Russia, Belarus or Iran. “We do not support or condone the use of our products in applications they weren't designed for,” they said.An Analog Devices spokesman said the company had “ceased business activities in Russia, and in the Russian-backed regions of Ukraine and Belarus, and promptly instructed all of our distributors to halt shipments of our products into these regions.“Any post-sanctions shipment into these regions is a direct violation of our policy and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion.”]"

TXN, and Broadcom Inc. AVGO – all have a shareholder-friendly nature, rewarding investors with a dividend.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s take a closer glance at each one.Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the world’s largest circuit foundry. The stock came under a lot of attention a few months back following a purchase from the legendary Warren Buffett.TSM’s annual dividend currently yields a solid 1.5% paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 22% of earnings. Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by nearly 11% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, TSM’s valuation multiples aren’t stretched, further reinforced by the company’s Style Score of “B” for Value.Currently, TSM shares trade at a 16.7X forward earnings multiple, beneath the 19.9X five-year median by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTexas Instruments Inc. Texas Instruments is an original equipment manufacturer of analog, mixed-signal, and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits.It’s hard to ignore the company’s dividend metrics; TXN shares currently yield a rock-solid 2.9% annually, well above the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average.Story continuesAnd the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, growing its payout by more than 15% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTXN just reported quarterly results on January 24th, which were better than expected; Texas Instruments reported earnings of $2.13 per share, above the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by nearly 9%.Quarterly revenue also came in strong, reported at $4.7 billion and reflecting a 1.6% sales surprise.

3,f471c431-8be0-328e-9b5b-9a7f852dac04,WDC,2023-01-28,Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 9.9% loss over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-digital-corporation-nasdaq-wdc-130322532.html,1674911002,STORY,['WDC'],"[Every investor in Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Last week's US$2.1b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 9.9% losses.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Western Digital, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Western Digital ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Western Digital?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Western Digital already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Western Digital, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Western Digital is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.9% and 3.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Western DigitalThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Western Digital Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$56m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in Western Digital. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 8 cents per share, against the earnings of $2.30 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.Western Digital expects non-GAAP revenues between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.01 billion, indicating a decline of 37.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing once. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 3.1%, on average. In the past year, shares of WDC have lost 12.3% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s decline of 15.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to Note Ahead of Q2 ReleaseWestern Digital’s fiscal second quarter performance is likely to have been affected by weakening consumer demand owing to prevailing global macroeconomic uncertainties and rising inflation. Apart from inventory corrections by consumers, persistent supply-chain troubles and economic slowdown in China related to COVID-19 continue to remain headwinds.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in fourth-quarter calendar-year 2022 are likely to have negatively impacted hard disk drive (HDD) sales resulting in affecting the company’s performance in the quarter under review. Higher costs associated with ramping up next-generation energy-assisted hard drives amid stiff competition in the disk-drive market might have dented fiscal second quarter profits.To battle macroeconomic uncertainties, WDC is focused on reducing capital investments and operating expenses to better align cash flow and cost structure with market conditions.Coming to the product group, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flash revenues is pegged at $1.337 billion. Flash demand is under pressure due to inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower flash pricing. The ramp-up of new 5G phones incorporating the company’s latest BiCS5 flash solutions and strength in the company’s SanDisk and WD Black product lines bode well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second quarter HDD revenues is pegged at $1.693 billion. HDD revenues are expected to have been negatively impacted by decline in demand in other capacity enterprise product channels. However, the adoption of SMR hard drives (especially 17 terabyte per capacity enterprise drive and 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments) remains healthy and is likely to have cushioned the segment’s performance.Story continuesWestern Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Western Digital this time around.

The ETF is also above both its 50-day EMA and 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average). If SPY can trade and hold above this downtrend it may be a strong signal that the market is on the verge of a new bull market.If the market does breakout, one place to invest will be stocks with improving earnings. Utilizing the Zacks Rank, we can identify stocks with earnings expectations being revised higher, improving our odds of buying market-beating stocks. Alternatively, even if the market doesn’t breakout, stocks with upward earnings momentum should provide some downside risk protection.Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis is a valuable tool for investors, providing them with the ability to identify entry and exit points for improved risk-reward outcomes. While it may not have the ability to predict the future, it remains one of many indications for investors to consider.The 50-day EMA is still below the 200-day EMA. Technical traders often use the 50/200 EMA crossover as a filter for the long-term trend of the market. With the 50-day still below the 200-day EMA, we may still consider the market in a downward trend. However, if price does trade above this breakout level, it may very well initiate the EMA crossover signal.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor CorporationNucor Corporation NUE is a manufacturer and seller of steel and steel products. Nucor’s steel mills produce specialty steel products including hot rolled, cold rolled, galvanized sheet steel, and beam blanks among many others. More recently, Nucor is experiencing strong growth in the non-residential construction and the heavy equipment market. Nucor has been expanding its production capacity through strategic acquisitions, bringing the total facilities up to 123 in Canada and the United States.  Nucor stock has been on a tear over the last two years, up 248% over that period, trouncing the broad market, and significantly outperforming the Steel-Producers industry average. According to Zacks estimates, it looks like this rally could be set to continue.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNUE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating a strong trend higher in earnings revisions. Interestingly, the steel market and Nucor’s earnings expectations are not particularly enticing for the coming quarter, as sales and earnings are projected to shrink -26% and -53% respectively, but FY expectations are beginning to turn in a big way.While the current quarter earnings expectations have been revised lower over the last 90 days, the current year has seen the opposite. FY23 earnings have been revised from $11.01 per share 90 days ago to $12.96 today. And they have been revised higher over every time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther boosting the stock, is Nucor’s buyback program, which has purchased 3.1 million shares over the last quarter and 20.6 million over the last year.

NUE stock currently yields a 1.2% dividend.Nucor has a 1 year forward P/E of 13.4x, above the industries average of 9.5x, and above its ten-year median of 10.5x.Phillip Morris InternationalPhilip Morris International PM is a manufacturer and seller of cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine related products outside of the US, in 180 countries. In 2008 the company was spun off from Altria Group MO, although Philip Morris US still functions as a subsidiary of Altria Group. Additionally, PM shares a licensing agreement with MO for the sale of IQOS (non-combustible tobacco product) in the United States.The tobacco and now smoke free giant has outperformed the industry and the broad market over the last year. This outperformance is due in part to PM’s strong pricing power and its successful shift to smoke free products. Notably, smoke free products, also referred to as RRP (reduced risk products), sales have jumped 12% over the last quarter, and now make up 30% of total revenue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhilip Morris currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a strong history of upside earnings surprises. Earnings estimate revision on the face look a bit mixed, but over the next year are being upgraded. Current quarter expectations have been revised just slightly lower from $1.33 per share to $1.29 per share over the last 90 days, but next quarter estimates are being revised higher. Additionally, next year’s estimates have seen more significant revisions, up to $5.91 per share vs $5.65 90 days ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhilip Morris has a one year forward P/E of 17.6x, just below the S&amp;P’s average of 18.2x, and above its five-year median of 15x. PM stock also offers a very nice dividend payment, yielding 4.9%.Cleveland-Cliffs Cleveland-Cliffs CLF, formerly Cliffs Natural Resources, is another Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CLF is the largest producer of steel pellets in North America, and largest producer of flat rolled steel in its region. CLF primarily sells products to integrated steel companies in Canada and the United States, and owns mines in Minnesota and Michigan.Cleveland-Cliff earnings estimates have seen some very interesting trends in revisions and should be looked at closely in the table below. Current quarter earnings have been mostly revised lower over the last 90 days, which of course isn’t encouraging. But next quarter, current year, and next year earnings have all been revised significantly higher over the last 30 days. Next quarter, you can see was first revised lower from $0.37 to just $0.06 per share, but was then higher up to $0.25. You can see the same trend, a revision lower 60 days ago followed by revisions higher 30 and 7 days ago, in current year and next year. An interesting, and promising development for the steel producer.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCLF currently has a one year forward P/E of 10x, above its 5-year median of 6x, and below its Mining sub-industry of 12x. CLF stock has had a volatile last five years, oscillating between strong outperformance, and deep underperformance against the broad market, somewhat typical of commodities companies who experience strong cyclical tendencies. Based on Zacks figures, it seems likely that the recent period of outperformance may continue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionThe broad market is at a precipice. Either it breaks out above this technical pattern or reverses lower and shakes all the newfound market bulls. While these three stocks should perform well in a new bull market, thanks to Zacks analysis, they will likely also perform well if the market remains shaky. Zacks earnings revisions are a strong indication of individual stocks with potential to outperform the market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

I would now like to introduce Jack Sullivan, General Manager of Nucor Investor Relations. You may now begin your call.Jack Sullivan: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Nucor's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Review and Business Update.

The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Leon.Story continuesLeon Topalian: Thanks, Jack, and welcome, everyone. I would like to begin by highlighting some recent organizational changes. Earlier this month, Noah Hanners joined the executive team as EVP for Raw Materials. Noah is a West Point graduate with his Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering and his MBA from UNC Chapel Hill. He also served our nation in the United States Army for nine-years. Noah began his career with Nucor in 2011 at Nucor Steel Darlington and has worked at several of our divisions, most recently serving as Vice President and General Manager of the David Joseph Company. Doug Jellison, previously EVP of Raw Materials has accepted the newly created role of EVP for Strategy. Doug has been with Nucor for more than 30-years and has a great understanding of all of our business segments.As we continue to grow Nucor, Doug will continue to help ensure we are further leveraging our competitive advantages across the enterprise. Congratulations to both Noah and Doug. Now turning to our year-end review. I'm proud to announce that 2022 was the safest and most profitable year in Nucor's history, breaking prior record set in 2021. In the face of uncertain and at times volatile market conditions, we stayed focused on our goal of becoming the world's safest steel company and our mission to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture. In terms of safety, we established another record low injury and illness rate for the fourth consecutive year. 20 Nucor divisions went the entire year without a single recordable injury, and we set new records across each of the four primary safety metrics that Nucor tracks.And we achieved all of this during a period of rapid growth welcoming over 2,000 new team members to the Nucor family throughout the year. I'm inspired by the way, each member of the Nucor team has embraced our most important value, the health, safety and well-being of all 31,000 team members who make up our family. Turning to financial performance. We earned $4.89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022 on her way to setting a new earnings record of $28.79 per share for the full-year. This represents a 24% increase over the annual EPS record we previously set in 2021. Our operations continue to generate strong cash flow with a record 11.6 billion of EBITDA. This allowed us to advance our strategy along several fronts, while also returning 3.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our capital allocation strategy of returning at least 40% of earnings to Nucor shareholders.Our return on invested capital stands at a healthy 35%, and we closed out the year by announcing the 50th consecutive annual increase to our regular dividend following Nucor's original listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. This places Nucor among an elite group of roughly 40 dividend kings referring to publicly traded companies that have consistently increased annual dividends to shareholders for over a half a century. These successes were in large part made possible through their hard work and dedication of the Nucor team who executed our strategy to achieve world-class performance. As most of you know, we share our profits with our team and in just a few weeks, we will reach a milestone never achieved before Nucor's history, delivering nearly $1 billion back to our teammates.In 2022, we made considerable progress along all of our strategic initiatives, deploying approximately $2 billion in CapEx and completing five acquisitions valued at approximately $3.6 billion, to grow our core and expand beyond. But we didn't just invest in new assets and business lines. We invested in a more sustainable future. We did this through new partnerships and capital commitments to our technologies that can help reduce our carbon footprint even further. In December, we announced an equity investment in Electra, a boulder-based start-up that has developed a process to produce carbon-free iron used in making steel. In November, Nucor became the first major industrial company in the world to join the United Nations' 24/7 carbon-free energy Global Compact which aims to accelerate the world's transition to clean, affordable and reliable electricity.Nucor also cofounded the Global Steel Climate Council in International Coalition advocating for a single, transparent global emission standard that is focused on steelmaking emissions and last week, the NRC officially certified new scales design to build a small modular reactor, the first of its kind approved for use in the United States. Nucor's minority investment in NuScale will continue to support the development of this technology with the goal of producing 100% of carbon-free electricity. Our mission to grow the core, expand beyond and live our culture is delivering results for our company and our shareholders. In our steelmaking operations, we invested in new capabilities to produce more value-added products and improve operating efficiencies that can earn higher and more sustained margins.In our downstream operations, we continue to expand into new steel adjacent markets where we can offer differentiated solutions, including overhead doors and utility towers. These represent unique opportunities in faster-growing markets where Nucor can leverage its core competencies, supply chain efficiencies and market channels to create incremental value for shareholders. And we lived our culture. For over 50-years, Nucor's unique culture has created value for shareholders as it empowers and incentivize teammates to take ownership of decision-making, drive efficiency and pursue innovation. Let me provide an update on some of our larger initiatives to grow the core, starting with our Brandenburg Plate Mill. Nearly four-years after it was first announced, the Brandenburg team rolled their first steel plate on December 30.They are now focused on final commissioning of the mill and plan to begin customer shipments by the end of the quarter. Last week, we announced the Brandenburg mill would produce a new product called Elcyon, a sustainable heavy-gauge steel plate designed to meet the growing demands of the offshore wind industry. Congrats to the entire Nucor Brandenburg team for delivering one of the safest mill start-ups in Nucor's history and for completing it on time and on budget. Turning to our sheet operations. We announced plans to build a continuous galv line at California Steel Industries to serve construction markets in the Western United States. Recent closures of galvanizing capacity by other suppliers in the West presented Nucor a unique opportunity to better serve this region.This new galv line along with the line we completed at Nucor Gallatin in 2019 and future lines planned for Berkeley and Nucor West Virginia will position the company as a supplier of choice for the cleaner, value-added sheet products our customers are seeking in several key markets. Investments like this help forge even stronger relationships with our key customers, like Trane Technologies, which honored Nucor last week with their 2022 Supplier of the Year award. Now shifting to our Expand Beyond strategy. I would like to provide an update on a few of our recent acquisitions we have completed, beginning with our midyear purchase of C.H.I. overhead doors. When we announced this transaction and held a special investor call last May, we spoke about C.H.I.'s $230 million LTM EBITDA, it is 30% EBITDA margins and average annual revenue growth of 10%.In the last six-months following our June closing, C.H.I. generated record EBITDA of nearly 170 million, finishing the full-year with over 320 million of EBITDA and expanding margins. Within the first six-months of closing, we have taken our implied trailing EBITDA acquisition multiple down from 13 times to just over nine times. Going beyond the strong financial results, I want to commend the entire C.H.I. team for executing such a quick and seamless integration into Nucor. We are already seeing the benefits of our combined operations, including improvements to C.H.I.'s safety performance. Thank you. Thank you, team C.H.I. and all of the Nucor team members had have come together to make this an incredibly successful transition. And we are starting to realize supply chain synergies as well with C.H.I., developing plans to source most of its cheap bar and tube from Nucor divisions.The sales team at C.H.I. is collaborating with Nucor's regional commercial groups and cross-selling efforts have begun as C.H.I. grows its share of the commercial overhead door market. Last year, we also acquired Summit Utility Structures, producer of steel structures for the utility, telecommunications and transportation sectors. It is an area that we see considerable growth potential in. Then in December, we announced plans to construct two new state-of-the-art tower production plants. These highly automated facilities will help meet the growing need for utility infrastructure as our nation's electric transmission grid is modernized and hardened. Turning to the broader economic backdrop. We recognize there continues to be uncertainty, but we also see tailwinds that should benefit Nucor as well as the American steel industry throughout this decade, including the Infrastructures Act, the CHIPS Act and IRA that are all starting to work their way into the steel sector.These programs align perfectly with Nucor's unmatched and unrivaled product capabilities to meet the growing demand of our customers today and well into the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Steve Laxton, who will share more about our Q4 performance. Steve.Stephen Laxton: Thank you, Leon. As Leon mentioned, our earnings of $28.79 per share established a new record for the company. These results highlight the earnings power of Nucor's diversified portfolio and industry-leading capabilities. 2022 was also a noteworthy year for cash flows at Nucor. For the year, cash from operations exceeded $10 billion for the first time in our history, and free cash flow topped $8 billion. Over the past five-years, Nucor has generated $16.6 billion in free cash flow. During that same time period, we returned $9.7 billion directly to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and while at the same time, investing over $12.8 billion in our business through capital expenditures and acquisitions to further strengthen and grow our earnings base.These results demonstrate continued and consistent adherence to our balanced capital allocation framework. Nucor's efficient manufacturing business model is a powerful through-cycle cash flow generator. Turning to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Earnings for the Steel Mills segment were down nearly 60% from the prior quarter. Shipment volumes fell 13%, reflecting normal seasonal weaknesses and some purchasing hesitancy as prices were trending lower for much of the quarter. Overall, metal margins contracted as lower realized pricing outpaced lower cost for metallics. Conversion costs were slightly lower compared to the third quarter despite lower utilization rates, in part due to energy cost, which fell approximately 10% on a per ton basis.Photo by Russ Ward on UnsplashAlloys and consumable costs also trended slightly lower. Shifting to our Steel Products segment. We continue to see very strong performance with segment earnings of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. This is down about 10% from the third quarter's record results, but still represents the third best earnings quarter ever for this segment. Contributions from most product lines were down from their respective third quarter levels, reflecting normal seasonality. And C.H.I. overhead doors was a notable exception, as Leon touched on earlier, posting fourth quarter earnings 20% higher than the prior quarter. Turning to Raw Materials. This segment saw negative earnings for the quarter as DRI and scrap processing results were impacted by lower volumes and falling prices for much of the quarter.We also took both DRI facilities off-line for planned maintenance and elected to extend those outages for additional service until we saw signs of improving conditions later in the quarter. On the capital deployment front, Nucor's CapEx for the quarter totaled approximately $520 million, bringing total CapEx for the year just under $2 billion. We are forecasting CapEx in 2023 at $3 billion, including some catch-up spending originally slated for 2022, new growth initiatives and general maintenance. The earnings presentation we posted on our Investor Relations site this morning has additional details on our 2023 capital spending plan, including projected allocations among primary CapEx categories, and a preliminary look at the anticipated pace of spending on a few of our major growth projects over the next couple of years.I would like to take a minute and provide an update on the strong results we are already seeing from recently completed investments. While strong conditions in 2022, certainly aided performance, we believe these were prudent, timely and well executed investments that are yielding excellent returns and position the company for continued future success. The roughly $2.2 billion we invested in sheet and bar projects that have been up and running for the past few years, generated an estimated $620 million in EBITDA for 2022. In the businesses we acquired over the last two-years for around $4.5 billion, establishing four new downstream platforms generated EBITDA of nearly $500 million over the course of the year. We believe this puts us well on our way to reaching our annual run rate EBITDA goal of $700 million for our Expand Beyond businesses.Collectively, these strategic investments in those to come, provide significant earnings catalysts and position Nucor for sustained value creation long-term. Turning to our balance sheet. We finished the year in a very strong liquidity position with over $4.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, and our $1.7 billion revolving credit facility remains undrawn. We have been intentional about building liquidity toward the end of the year in light of uncertain economic conditions, coupled with near-term uses of cash, including our 2022 profit-sharing payouts that are earned by our teammates, our capital spending plans and maintaining our commitment to meaningful direct returns to shareholders. In addition to ample near-term liquidity, Nucor's balance sheet continues to be in a position of strength with total debt to capital of around 25% at the end of the year and debt to EBITDA well under one turn.Earlier this week, Fitch Ratings published its first credit rating on Nucor with long-term and short-term unsecured ratings of A- and F1, respectively. We were pleased to see Fitch recognize Nucor's credit strength. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares valued at $403 million and made dividend payments of $130 million for a total of $533 million return directly to shareholders, which represents more than 42% of our quarterly net earnings. Over the last five-years, we have returned $9.7 billion to shareholders, representing approximately 52% of total net earnings for the period. As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2023, we expect earnings from our Steel Mills segment to increase compared to fourth quarter results on higher shipments, improved metal margins and expected higher realized prices.In our Steel Products segment, we expect lower earnings in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower volumes and lower pricing in some products. However, it is worth noting that earnings are expected to remain higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our Raw Materials segment earnings are expected to improve on more stable pricing and higher shipment volumes. While operating income from these three segments is expected to be higher compared to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated earnings for the first quarter to be lower due to higher intercompany eliminations and the absence of onetime state tax benefits that were realized in the fourth quarter. We remain relatively optimistic 2023 will be another strong year of earnings for Nucor despite entering a period of increased economic uncertainty.Overall, non-residential construction spending continues to be robust, federal support for infrastructure and energy projects will begin to show impacts on demand in 2023. Other positive drivers of demand include re-shoring of manufacturing, energy infrastructure demand, clean energy and storage projects, EV factories and semiconductor plants. In closing, we believe medium and long-term fundamentals of our industry and key demand drivers remain relatively positive. This coupled with our growth initiatives and investments that advance our strategy to grow our core and expand beyond position Nucor for strength well into the future. With that, we would like to hear from you and answer any questions.

ARE is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Jan 30 after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Pasadena, CA-based life science real estate investment trust (REIT), focusing on collaborative life science, agtech and technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, delivered a surprise of 0.47% in terms of adjusted FFO per share. ARE’s performance in the quarter was mainly driven by healthy leasing activity and rental rate growth.Alexandria has a decent surprise history. Over the preceding four quarters, ARE’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 1.36%. This is depicted in the graph below:Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayAlexandria has Class A properties in AAA locations. The high demand for Alexandria’s highly differentiated facilities, especially the key life science segment, is anticipated to have driven decent leasing and re-leasing activity and aided occupancy levels in the fourth quarter.The life science segment usually experiences resilience, even during economic downturns. The need for more effective and cost-efficient therapies and high demand from an aging population drive demand in this segment. As such, favorable demand-supply dynamics and ARE’s strong pricing power in its core markets are likely to have played a key role in its rental rate growth this quarter.Alexandria is also focused on maintaining its tenant quality. The majority of its rental revenues come from investment-grade or publicly-traded large-cap tenants. As a result, its long-term lease agreements with these tenants are expected to have generated impressive rent collections in the to-be-reported quarter. Backed by the healthy demand for its properties, ARE is expected to have continued with its development and redevelopment activities in the fourth quarter.Alexandria is expected to have maintained adequate financial flexibility to enhance its market position in the quarter. This is expected to have supported its development pipeline as well. These factors are anticipated to have aided revenues and the net operating income growth of ARE in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues currently stands at $654.75 million, suggesting a 13.5% increase from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly adjusted FFO per share currently stands at $2.13, suggesting an 8.12% increase from the prior-year period’s reported figure.However, ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst to make investors bullish on the stock. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged over the past month.For the full-year 2022, Alexandria projected adjusted FFO per share in the range of $8.40-$8.42. This is backed by same-property NOI growth at 6-8%, rental rate increases for lease renewals and re-leasing of space at 30-35% and occupancy in North America (as of Dec 31, 2022) in the band of 95.0-95.6%. Our projection for year-end occupancy is 95.6%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted FFO per share is pegged at $8.41. The figure indicates an 8.38% increase year over year on 21.7% year-over-year growth in revenues to $2.57 billion.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAlexandria does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Alexandria has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Agrochemical Companies in the World. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is about to enter a full twelve months upended global agriculture supply chains. Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's top agricultural and food products exporters, and a conflict between them cast doubt on the integrity of the global supply chain. As an illustration of the importance of both countries in the global food supply chain, data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that as of August 2022, Russia and Ukraine were responsible for producing 13% of the world's wheat - with the lion's share of 10% going to Russia. This made Russia the world's largest wheat exporter and Ukraine the fifth largest.Similarly, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that apart from wheat, Ukraine was the world's largest sunflower producer, the second largest producer of sunflower oil and sunflower meal, and the fourth largest producer of barley. Why is this important? Well, the Ukraine invasion has led to supply diversification across a host of sectors, such as energy, and including agriculture.

Walmart is the country's biggest grocer, generating more than 50% of its sales selling day-to-day essentials. (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Josie Kao)]"

This is according to a report in The Journal today. Now CVS, the nation's largest drugstore chain, planning to cut or adjust hours at about 9,000 locations. Walmart saying that it will begin closing pharmacies at 7:00 PM, instead of 9:00 PM, at most of its roughly 4,600 stores. Both companies saying that the changes will begin in March.Now in a recent statement, CVS said it is reducing hours during times of low patient demand, or when there's only one pharmacist on site. Now Walmart saying that the shorter hours will offer its pharmacists better work-life balance and a greater capacity to serve customers in the hours that they are most likely to visit.And just to paint the picture here just how hard it is to recruit pharmacists, to get pharmacists through their doors, Walgreens was offering bonuses of up to $75,000 over the summer to attract pharmacists. And when you take a look at pharmacy schools, the applications, the applicants there, that has been dropping off a cliff, down about a third from its peak a decade ago. So this is a problem that doesn't seem like it's going away anytime soon.DAVE BRIGGS: And they were paying 20 bucks an hour to begin with. So this is a well paid profession and not brutal hours. But this is just one more industry facing a shortage. And it's essentially every industry at this point. We've heard about teachers. We've heard about nurses. We've heard about truck drivers. You've all heard about pilots, and we've all experienced that when we fly-- accountants. A massive shortage at the moment. It is everywhere, and the US Chamber of Commerce actually looked into that earlier this year.None of those professions were among the highest of the quit rates, which is how, of course, they measure it. And that came in at retail and hospitality, those two different sectors. Retail is now at 40% of the staffing levels, where they need them. Hospitality is seeing a 5.2% quit rate. Where are we going to find these workers, Jared? How are we going to solve this problem? I can't help but think about H1-B visas and immigration because the labor force participation rate seems like it's never coming back from where it was pre-pandemic.Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: Well, we have a nasty, nasty recession. I think it'll jump back, but not in the best way, because people will be forced to work, come out of retirement. I was just tracking along with you, Seana, some of the incentives to fix what I believe are structural problems here, not only in the pharmaceutical industry, but everything that we're talking about. It's going to take a few years for this to shake out. They're even figuring out ways to use remote work in pharmacy.So there are certain tasks, I'd imagine menial tasks, maybe computer tasks that you could do remotely. So they're exploring that as well. And by the way, we're going to be talking about ChatGPT and AI. Why won't AI be participating in some of these new--DAVE BRIGGS: As pharmacists?JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, why not?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I don't think you count anything out. It sounds like ChatGPT's coming for all of our jobs.JARED BLIKRE: It just passed the medical boards, by the way.SEANA SMITH: I know. It did. It did. You can't top-- and the bar and the MBA. The list goes on and on and on.]"

I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.John Doyle: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am excited to be leading this call today for the first time as President and CEO. Marsh McLennan is an outstanding company with unique capabilities in the critical areas of risk, strategy and people. We help clients address their greatest challenges and find new possibilities as they navigate dynamic environments.Story continuesWe have exceptional talent, a wide range of solutions and a track record of execution in financial performance. Our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. Over the past year, I've been meeting with colleagues and clients to exchange ideas about how we can accelerate impact for clients and enable their success. These conversations reinforce my conviction that we are in the right businesses with strong brands and deep client relationships. I am confident that we have meaningful opportunity at the intersections of our businesses, where together our scale, data, insights and solutions are highly valued by clients.The strength of our unique value proposition has us well positioned for the years ahead. Today, we are focused, aligned, and succeeding together as our results demonstrate. 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Our total revenue surpassed $20 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $4.8 billion. This was on top of 18% growth in 2021. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. Adjusted EPS growth was 11%. I am particularly pleased with this performance as our results included costs related to our strategic investments in talent and the continued normalization of T&amp;E.These results also came on top of 24% growth in 2021, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders raising our dividend by 10% and completing $1.9 billion of share repurchases the largest annual amount in our history.Avascent: We overcame significant foreign exchange and capital market headwinds to generate these results through execution, growth and exceptional client engagement. I'm particularly proud of these achievements amid a year of seamless leadership transitions at Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Our purpose and strategy underpin our performance. Marsh McLennan makes a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues, and our communities. Turning purpose into practice our strategy focuses on several core elements, promoting a culture that attracts and retains top talent in our business, investing to strengthen our capabilities organically and inorganically, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive fundamentals, leveraging data and insights to help clients become more resilient and find new opportunities, and delivering Marsh McLennan's full value proposition to enable client success.We complement our colleague and client facing strategy with our approach to expense and capital management. We focus on growing revenue faster than expenses, which contributes to annual margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth, and we manage capital allocation to balance performance in the near-term with investing for the long term. We are accelerating collaboration across our business to drive greater growth and efficiency. We are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. In this regard, we took actions in the fourth quarter to align our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduced our real estate footprint. Together, these actions resulted in an approximately $230 million of charges.Based on our outlook today, we expect they will drive $125 million to $150 million of savings in 2023. Overall, they reflect an opportunity to accelerate impact for clients, reinvest in our capabilities, and to be more efficient and connected.P&amp;C:ceded: Now, let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.47 which is up 8% versus a year ago or 12%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 7%. Underlying revenue grew 8% in RIS and 6% in consulting. Marsh grew 6%. Guy Carpenter grew 5%. Mercer grew 5%, and Oliver Wyman grew 8%. Overall the fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 13%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year. As we look ahead to 2023, we see a mixed economic picture. While there is a risk of recession for major economies, we also believe there are many factors that remain supportive of growth for our business. Softer real GDP growth is offset by elevated inflation, which drives higher insured values and loss costs.P&amp;C insurance rates continue to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs continue to rise due to higher wages and labor shortages in the healthcare sector. The U.S. labor market continues to remain among the tightest employment environments of the past half century with 3.5% unemployment and over $10 million unfilled jobs and short-term interest rates are at the highest level since the financial crisis increasing our fiduciary income. When the world is volatile and uncertain, demand for our services typically rises. This year's global risks report, which we just published in collaboration with the World Economic Forum highlights that risks confronting our clients extend well beyond economic and insurance cycle concerns.The report identified the cost of living crisis, failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change, extreme weather, natural resource crises, the erosion of social cohesion, cybercrime and geo-economic confrontation among the top risks facing society over the near-term and next decade. In these areas and many others, we are working with clients to meet these challenges, build resilience and capture new opportunities. Our colleagues are inspired by the opportunity to work on these critical issues and to make a difference in the moments that matter. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth in 2023, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS.Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist, but meaningful uncertainty exists and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. However, we have a track record of resilience across economic cycles. In summary, 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan, one in which all of our businesses delivered strong performance. We generated record revenues and earnings, saw the benefit of recent investments in growth, continued to execute on our acquisition strategy and made record share repurchases. We are proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. We closed the year on a high note and look forward to another year of strong performance in 2023.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.Photo by Campaign Creators on UnsplashMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, which capped another terrific year. We delivered strength on strength from a financial performance perspective and continued to invest organically and inorganically. These investments combined with the actions we took in the fourth quarter, position us well for another good year in 2023. Consolidated revenue decreased 2% in the fourth quarter to $5 billion. As a reminder, the fourth quarter last year included a large gain related to Marsh India. Foreign exchange was also a meaningful headwind to GAAP revenue growth. However, on an underlying basis, revenue increased 7%. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $680 million and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1 billion.Our adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22%. GAAP EPS was $0.93 and adjusted EPS was $1.47. Our full year, 2022 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% over 2021. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $6.85 and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points marking our 15th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2022 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $3.9 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our dividend 10% and saw Moody's lift our rating outlook to positive. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. Note that RIS in specifically Marsh is where the India gain affected our revenue comparisons.On an underlying basis, revenue in RIS increased 8%, the strong result reflecting the momentum in our business and our resilience in the face of macro headwinds and on economic uncertainty. RIS operating income was $472 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 23% to $685 million. The adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points to 25.6%. For the year, revenue in RIS was $12.6 billion and increase of 5% with underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 15%, our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 130 basis points to 29.8%. At Marsh revenue in the quarter decreased 6% to $2.7 billion, but was up 6% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, which saw strong M&amp;A and SPAC related activity.For the full year revenue at Marsh was $10.5 billion, an increase of 3% or 8% on an underlying basis. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, a solid result given the headwind from lower M&amp;A and capital markets activity. We expect this headwind to persist into the first quarter, but normalize as we enter the second quarter. For the full year underlying growth in U.S. and Canada was excellent at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 8% in the quarter with Asian Pacific up 12%, EMEA up 7%, and Latin America up 4%. For the full year underlying growth in international was strong at 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $171 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 8% or 9% on an underlying basis.Based on our current outlook, we expect Guy Carpenter's growth in 2023 to benefit from a tightening reinsurance market. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.1 billion flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 6% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $336 million, and adjusted operating income was $407 million, down 1% reflecting continued foreign exchange and capital markets headwinds. The adjusted operating margin was 20% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points. For the full year Consulting revenue was $8.1 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 4% to $1.5 billion, while our adjusted operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 19.7%.Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This is a good result considering the impact of capital markets on our investments business. Wealth was flat on an underlying basis due to year-over-year declines in both equity and fixed income markets. Solid growth in defined benefits helped mitigate the drop in investments. Our assets under management were $345 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially, but down 17% from the fourth quarter of last year due to market declines in foreign exchange, which more than offset strong positive net flows. Health revenue grew 8% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions.Career revenue increased 12% on an underlying basis, reflecting continued demand in rewards, talent strategy, and workforce transformation. For the year revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis, the highest result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $765 million, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, a solid result considering a tough comparison to 22% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, building on the 21% growth in 2021. As we look to 2023, we expect growth at Oliver Wyman to slow given rising economic uncertainty. Adjusted corporate expense was $68 million in the quarter.Foreign exchange was a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter, and for the full year was a $0.12 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.03 headwind in 2023 with $0.05 in the first quarter and $0.02 in the second quarter, reversing to a modest tailwind in the second half. I want to spend a minute on the $344 million of noteworthy items in the quarter, the majority of which related to actions we initiated last year, as well as the final exit of JLT's headquarters in London. The largest category of noteworthy items in the quarter was $233 million relating to restructuring activities which are focused on workforce actions, rationalizing technology, and reducing our overall real estate footprint. The charges included severance associated with headcount reductions, as well as provisions related to real estate actions.Although we expect some reinvestment of the savings from these actions, the majority will flow to earnings. Based on our outlook today, we expect the benefit to earnings in 2023 could be $125 million to $150 million. We anticipate further actions under this program, which will continue through 2023 and possibly into 2024. We are still refining estimates of future opportunities, but at this point, we don't see additional charges in 2023 or 2024 exceeding the amounts taken in 2022. As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, will give a brief update on our global retirement plans. Our other net benefit credit was $57 million in the quarter and $235 million for the full year. For 2023, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million.Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $169 million in 2022. We expect cash contributions will be roughly $107 million in 2023. Investment income was a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and a loss of $5 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects losses in our private equity portfolio. Given current market conditions, we anticipate negligible investment income in the first quarter of 2023. This compares to $17 million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year of 2023 of approximately $565 million. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management.Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22.9%. This compares with 20.6% in the fourth quarter last year. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2022 our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% compared with 23.6% in 2021. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 25% to 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management in our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11.5 billion. This includes the $1 billion of senior notes we issued in October.We used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to redeem $350 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March, 2023. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $298 million for dividends, $395 million for acquisitions, and $350 million for share repurchases. For the year uses of cash totaled $3.9 billion and included $1.1 billion for dividends, $806 million for acquisitions, and $1.9 billion for sherry purchases. As a reminder, we have a balanced capital management strategy that supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near-term while investing for sustained growth over the long-term.We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both for organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Looking ahead to 2023, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&amp;A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy.However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth in our business. Based on our outlook today for 2023, we expect mid-single digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.John Doyle: Thank you, Mark.

One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), crossed party lines to vote in favor.While the bill has little chance of being considered by the Senate and even less chance of reaching President Biden’s desk, the measure put the issue of SPR management at the top of Washington’s agenda for at least two days as the reserve sits at its lowest level since 1983.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) kicked off the debate Thursday, saying the bill was necessary to “ensure this vital American energy asset — and American security interests — will not be drained away for non-emergency, political purposes.”Under the bill, other than during an emergency situation, a president wouldn’t be able to tap the reserve unless it simultaneously released a plan to increase oil production in the U.S.Meanwhile, Democrats stood largely unified in opposition with Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) releasing a statement immediately after the vote, saying it was called at the behest of oil companies and it would “raise gas prices and impede the President’s ability to continue lowering costs at the pump for working families.“Private security contractors patrol the U.S. Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Bryan Mound, Texas May 20, 2008. (REUTERS/Donna W. Carson)'An effort to attack the president'Numerous amendments were considered from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) offered an idea to ban offshore drilling in her home state, but dismissed the overall process in an interview.“The whole conversation starts in this place that I think is rather cynical and just an effort to attack the president,"" she said. Still, she acknowledged there is some value in discussing the SPR overall, but suggested little would come of it.Story continues“I don't know that that's the most pressing conversation to have,” she said.The Biden administration made its first big withdrawal from the SPR in November 2021 of 50 million barrels in response to high gas prices. It followed up with over 180 million barrels over the course of 2022 in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Those were in addition to other scheduled regular withdrawals and cycling of the SPR.Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) has taken over the influential House House Energy and Commerce Commitee. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Supporters of the administration's strategy say the moves in 2022 were crucial to reducing gas prices by over $1.50 a gallon in recent months. The national average for gas prices sits at about $3.50 per gallon, with some observers expecting the price to rise in the coming months possibly to over $4 a gallon as demand picks up in the spring.Last month, the administration announced plans to begin replenishing the reserve, but rejected some initial offers because of pricing, with crude oil around $80/barrel.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters on Monday she is not worried about reaching the administration’s goal of buying 60 million barrels in the coming months, teasing an announcement that she promised “very soon.” Granholm added that Biden would veto the House GOP bill in the unlikely event it reaches his desk.This week’s vote follows a Jan. 12 vote around the SPR and China, which received wide bipartisan backing, a feat that was not repeated this week.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

It is worth considering Omnicom (OMC), which belongs to the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry.This advertising company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.81%.For the last reported quarter, Omnicom came out with earnings of $1.77 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.64 per share, representing a surprise of 7.93%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.68 per share, delivering a surprise of 7.69%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Omnicom, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Omnicom has an Earnings ESP of +2.75% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Let's take a look at some of the biggest movers that we have seen of the week. First up, we got to take a look at Tesla. We're looking at gains of another 11% today, that rally extending through. Tesla reported record fourth quarter revenue, and CEO Elon Musk giving that upbeat outlook for demand on Tesla's earnings call.Now the stock is up more than 20% when you take a look at that two-day chart on track for the best week that we have seen since 2013, taking a look at the five-day gains of just about 33% year to date. Certainly, has been a massive winner, one of the top performers here. You're looking at year-to-date gains of just about 44%.Next up, let's take a look at Salesforce because it has been quite a five-day week here for the company. Elliott Management taking a multi-billion dollar stake in the company. Now the activist investor is pushing for board changes. The Wall Street Journal reporting today that Salesforce has appointed three new directors-- Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra, ValueAct Capital CEO Mason Morfit, and also former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald.Now this follows-- the Journal's report follows our colleague Brian Sozzi's reporting yesterday that Elliott Management may put forth its own candidates to join Salesforce's board. Closing the week, we're looking at gains of nearly 9%, giving back some of those gains today, closing off just about 3/10 of a percent. But clearly a move here to the upside.Next up, let's take a look at Microsoft. The company, shares did sink initially. You can see the drop there on Wednesday after the company reported its earnings and also warned of a slowdown in its cloud business and software sales. That, of course, sent a warning signal to the rest of tech since Microsoft often viewed as a bellwether there for the industry.Wall Street has been cutting its estimates here for tech earnings in recent weeks. Now BMO wrote that Microsoft's results, quote, served as a reminder to temper expectations for better software demand trends any time soon. Looking at the stock this week, though, still barely holding onto gains, closing up just about 3%, able to shake off some of those jitters that we clearly saw within the stock on Wednesday.Rounding it out with Intel, that stock off just about 6 and 1/2% today, closing lower following its disappointing earnings report. Also issued one of the weakest quarterly forecasts that we have gotten from the company ever. This slowdown in the PC business clearly proving to be a huge challenge here. Bernstein writing in a note, quote, the magnitude of the deterioration is just stunning and now brings potential concern to the company's cash position over time. Over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 3 and 1/2%. But some of the selling that we saw today with the closing off just about 6%. We could see a bit of a followthrough as we look ahead to next week.]"

Its products are installed in more than 80% of the Fortune 500, and once new tools like Atlassians are embraced at big firms, its extremely difficult to change direction. This has helped Atlassian grow revenue from $145 million in 2013 to more than $2.7 billion over the last 12 months.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMAtlassian is impressiveThe company has grown to become a global leader in enterprise software solutions with a product mix that is very sticky. The more touch points across a clients organization a software vendor has, the higher the switching costs, and Atlassian has five main products:Jira: a very popular project management tool that helps teams track and organize their workConfluence: a collaboration platform for creating and sharing documents, knowledge bases and team wikisTrello: a visual tool for organizing and prioritizing tasks and projectsBitbucket: a version control system for software development teamsHipChat: a team communication tool for real-time chat, video conferencing and file sharingIn addition to these, Atlassian also offers a range of integrations and add-ons to help teams customize their workflow and improve their productivity through a diverse marketplace of third-party listed deliverables. The company offers its solutions through both software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions and enterprise license agreements with Jira being its preeminent offering.Atlassians marketing playbookAtlassian has built its business in the same way Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) did, using free trials to gain competitive advantages against would-be competition. The actual building of the software is no longer the hard part. Being able to get first mover advantage and then stay there is what's difficult. Most SaaS companies start by offering free versions of their software, often limited in features, and require payment to access more. The more with Atlassian's offering is tied to users, data storage and support.Story continuesAtlassians flagship project management tool Jira starts at $0 per user per month for up to 10 users. This rises from $7.75 to $15.25 per user for advanced with unlimited storage and 24/7 premium support. At the highest level, which is what most of those Fortune 500 clients are likely on, the service offers the additional benefits of centralized control, security and support. The point being, any company, big or small can get started and scale as needed.Atlassians current revenue is pretty stable considering the penetration in major American corporations and those high switching costs, which comes from the time and expense of implementing a new software package while maintaining the existing platform or the indirect costs in learning a new system. No matter how you look at it, Atlassian is here to stay.Atlassian seems overvalued by Mr. MarketDesipte the steller product offerings and revenue growth, the stock price has become out of balance with its real value. Of course, this could mean that the problem Atlassian solves is really hard or that investors believe that paying 13 times sales today will translate in someone else paying 13 times sales in a few years when annual revenue has doubled.A major red flag is that while the companys gross margins are above 80%, it still spends an inordinate of money on research and development. Thats typically a sticking point when investing in technology companies. Atlassian may have to continuously spend over 60% of its gross profit on R&amp;D just to keep up with competition as it tries to match growth estimates. By comparison, the SaaS pioneer Salesforce only spends 23% on research and development. This one line item on Atlassians income statement is the reason the company remains unprofitable. In fact, if that number was in line with Salesforces, Atlassian would be able to push nearly $1 billion to Ebitda. Considering its significant growth rate, that could justify a 40 times multiple.The good news is that 98% of transactions occur on the companys website, placing Sales, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) costs at just 46% of gross profit. Salesforces SG&amp;A costs eat up 74% of its gross profit. Even though it only generates $340,000 per employee, the company is still keeping the admin costs in check.For Atlassian, achieving high revenue growth is crucial for justifying its poor management and bloated employee base. In startups, its almost a requirement to hire fast and tack on as many people as possible to solve problems. Now, the company needs to scale back and become more efficient. A 30% top line growth rate alone is no longer enough. As the company expands and the industry becomes more competitive, growth could slow substantially.What price makes sense?This is one of those situations where value investors can understand the business, keep tabs on where the price fluctuates and act when it reaches a certain level. I believe that level is much lower based on todays performance indicators.Even assuming Atlassian can continue to grow at the current rates for the next five years, pushing revenue above $11 billion, the company will still likely be losing money. However, if any quarterly report shows research and development expenses stabilizing or declining, that would be good news for the bottom line.At this point, I believe a price-sales ratio of around 5 seems more in line with the market. Salesforce is priced at that level and it is the undisputed industry leader. That would place the market capitalization closer to $15 billion today and up to $55 billion in the future as long as Atlassian can continue the strong performance over the next five years.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

BMO Capital warning that the rally for Ralph Lauren may be short-lived after downgrading the stock to underperform, saying that the retailer is nearing pandemic peaks, which may be unsustainable. There's been a lot of closet and wardrobe refresh, as people have gotten back out to some of their social functions. But now that we've moved past the holiday season and schedules are starting to dwindle down a little bit, what's that mean for Ralph Lauren and for everybody who's already refreshed their closets?BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, of course, this note comes compliments friend of the show, Simeon Siegel, who is not writing about Peloton for a change, downgrading Polo. I think it makes sense to me. We've seen some bad news from a lot of these wholesale players. VF Corp are out with a warning. It is hard to believe Ralph Lauren is going to post anything good in a couple of weeks, no matter how amazing their management team is.JULIE HYMAN: I mean, I don't know. LVMH has been doing pretty good. Some of the other luxury retailers have been doing well.BRIAN SOZZI: But I can't find LVMH at Marshalls, and I can find them in Marshalls.JULIE HYMAN: Oh, that's a good point. You know, it's funny. I was just looking at my Rent the Runway recommendations and stuff. And there's some new stuff from Ralph Lauren. But it's not of how I think of Ralph Lauren. It's much more sort of-- it's not classic--[BUZZER]--shall we say?BRIAN SOZZI: So it's unclassic.JULIE HYMAN: It's more trendy-ish--BRIAN SOZZI: Trendy.JULIE HYMAN: --which is not what you want from Ralph Lauren, I think.

Get the Morning Brief sent directly to your inbox by signing up here. The tech industry is reeling from a seemingly nonstop parade of layoffs across Silicon Valley and beyond.And we're not talking small numbers either.Meta (META) started the mass layoff train, cutting 11,000 jobs in November. Then, on Jan. 4, Amazon (AMZN) piled on by laying off 18,000 employees. Two weeks later, Microsoft (MSFT) let go of 10,000 workers, and two days after that, on Jan. 20, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) laid off 12,000 employees.And those are just the major announcements.According to Layoffs.fyi, tech companies have cut 240,000 jobs since the start of 2021. Since the start of 2023? 68,149 jobs have been lost in the industry.And there’s no sign that the bleeding will stop anytime soon. Just this week, IBM laid off 3,900 employees, while SAP said it will cut 3,000 jobs.But the numbers of jobs lost are not the entire story.The tech layoffs that have roiled the industry over the last two years are a disaster of the tech companies' own making. From over-hiring, to a belief that the world would remain perpetually online after the pandemic, the industry is contending with its own miscalculations.And now the employees who pinned their futures on these strategic misfires are left to deal with the fallout.So how did we get here? The easy answer is that the economy soured as the world started pulling out of the pandemic. Inflation rose, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, and that was that. At least that's how tech executives tell it.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 25: A man walks near Google offices on January 25, 2023 in New York City. The U.S. Justice Department and a group of eight states sued Google accusing it of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising. (Photo by Leonardo Munoz/VIEWpress)Microsoft's Satya Nadella told employees that the consumers are looking to do more with less now after spending so much during the pandemic. Google's Sundar Pichai told employees that the company staffed up during the pandemic, but the economic situation has changed. And Amazon’s Andy Jassy said the uncertain economy and its decision to hire so many people during the pandemic is why the company is moving forward with layoffs.Story continuesThe reality is, companies hired for a world in which they thought the growth experienced during the pandemic was permanent. We'd all stay inside, order goods online, and stream content.Or to use the parlance of analysts and investors, the pandemic appeared to dramatically increase the TAM — or Total Addressable Market — these companies were going after. Using this logic, growing at all costs into a larger-than-expected market was not only reasonable, but necessary, to stay competitive.From Q4 2019 to Q3 2022, Microsoft grew its headcount 53.5%, while Google added 57% more workers. Amazon and Meta brought on 93.5% and 94.3% more employees, respectively.With revenue growing by leaps and bounds, and stock prices soaring, Big Tech was looking for a means to keep the party going, and adding more workers was seemingly the best way to do that.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.And now that someone — read: Jay Powell — flipped on the lights and turned off the music, those same tech companies have to reckon with their shoddy decisions. And reckon with a sea change in how the industry will measure success going forward.As Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote when disclosing his own company's decision to cut 20% of its team earlier this month: ""Over the past 10 years, we, along with most tech companies, became too focused on growing headcount as a metric for success. Especially in this economic environment, it's important to shift our focus to operational efficiency.""Even before the pandemic, we can remember Meta Platforms — then known as Facebook — talking up the investment it would need to make hiring to capture an ever-growing opportunity that seemed in front of them.Those days, clearly, are gone for now.But it's not just workers that Big Tech is cutting, either.Firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are reevaluating their product portfolios to see what can stay and what can go. Amazon, which dramatically expanded its warehouse footprint during the pandemic, is looking for ways to sublet some of its warehouse space to third-parties.Google just closed its Stadia game streaming service, though that's been in the works for some time. Meta, for its part, cut portions of its experimental product division, according to Platformer.Despite these layoffs and moves, friend of Yahoo Finance Sam Ro points out the tech industry makes up just 2.8% of total U.S. employment. Moreover, the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December and 4.5 million jobs last year.And while the big name tech companies might be cutting jobs, other industries are adding.Chipotle announced plans this week to hire 15,000 workers amid continued expansion plans. And Boeing said it would hire 10,000 workers in 2023 as production ramps up.So while tech giants seemingly got out over their skis extrapolating short-term trends into the future, other industries see the current economic one as one calling out for expansion.Which side of this divide is proven right long-term could have big implications for the economy in the years ahead. Or, perhaps, both positions will get to be right.Got a tip? Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The Wall Street Journal reporting today that Salesforce has appointed three new directors-- Mastercard CFO Sachin Mehra, ValueAct Capital CEO Mason Morfit, and also former Carnival CEO Arnold Donald.Now this follows-- the Journal's report follows our colleague Brian Sozzi's reporting yesterday that Elliott Management may put forth its own candidates to join Salesforce's board. Closing the week, we're looking at gains of nearly 9%, giving back some of those gains today, closing off just about 3/10 of a percent. But clearly a move here to the upside.Next up, let's take a look at Microsoft. The company, shares did sink initially. You can see the drop there on Wednesday after the company reported its earnings and also warned of a slowdown in its cloud business and software sales. That, of course, sent a warning signal to the rest of tech since Microsoft often viewed as a bellwether there for the industry.Wall Street has been cutting its estimates here for tech earnings in recent weeks. Now BMO wrote that Microsoft's results, quote, served as a reminder to temper expectations for better software demand trends any time soon. Looking at the stock this week, though, still barely holding onto gains, closing up just about 3%, able to shake off some of those jitters that we clearly saw within the stock on Wednesday.Rounding it out with Intel, that stock off just about 6 and 1/2% today, closing lower following its disappointing earnings report. Also issued one of the weakest quarterly forecasts that we have gotten from the company ever. This slowdown in the PC business clearly proving to be a huge challenge here. Bernstein writing in a note, quote, the magnitude of the deterioration is just stunning and now brings potential concern to the company's cash position over time. Over the last five days, we're looking at losses of just about 3 and 1/2%. But some of the selling that we saw today with the closing off just about 6%. We could see a bit of a followthrough as we look ahead to next week.]"

(NASDAQ:PAYX) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-115-paychex-inc-nasdaq-141426407.html,1674828866,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$126 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$111. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Paychex's current trading price of US$115 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Paychex’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Paychex What Is Paychex Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.61% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Paychex today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $105.01, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. What's more, Paychex’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Paychex look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 26% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Paychex. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PAYX’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PAYX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

69,9799015e-ba10-39c7-9a31-bc89d51b4e21,SYY,2023-01-28,Sysco (NYSE:SYY) Has A Pretty Healthy Balance Sheet,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sysco-nyse-syy-pretty-healthy-110054830.html,1674903654,STORY,['SYY'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt Dangerous?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Sysco What Is Sysco's Debt?As you can see below, Sysco had US$10.8b of debt, at October 2022, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$437.7m, its net debt is less, at about US$10.4b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Sysco's Balance Sheet?The latest balance sheet data shows that Sysco had liabilities of US$8.96b due within a year, and liabilities of US$12.1b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$437.7m and US$5.34b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$15.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Sysco has a huge market capitalization of US$39.5b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Sysco has a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.0 and its EBIT covered its interest expense 4.4 times. Taken together this implies that, while we wouldn't want to see debt levels rise, we think it can handle its current leverage. The good news is that Sysco grew its EBIT a smooth 42% over the last twelve months. Like the milk of human kindness that sort of growth increases resilience, making the company more capable of managing debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Sysco's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Sysco produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 58% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewThe good news is that Sysco's demonstrated ability to grow its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Sysco can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Sysco  that you should be aware of.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:XEL) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 26, 2023Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Xcel Energy Year End 2022 Earnings Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. Questions will be taken from institutional investors, reporters can contact media relations with inquiries and individual investors and others can reach out to Investor Relations. At this time, I turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Paul Johnson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.Paul Johnson: Good morning, and welcome to Xcel Energy's 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian Van Abel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have other members of the management team in the room to answer questions if needed. This morning we will review our 2022 results and highlights and share recent business developments and regulatory developments. Slides that accompany today's call are available on our website. As a reminder, some of our comments during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings.Today, we will also discuss certain metrics that are non-GAAP measures. Information on the comparable GAAP measures and reconciliations are included in our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bob Frenzel.Bob Frenzel: Thanks Paul, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. We had another very successful year at Xcel Energy, continuing to execute on our strategy while delivering strong financial and operational performance. For our investors, we delivered EPS of $3.17 representing the 18th consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our initial earnings guidance. In February, we raised our annual dividend for 19th straight year increasing at $0.12 per share or 6.6%. More recently, in November, we extended our long-term investment plan which features a 10-year capital outlook with an approximate 7% rate base growth. We ranked in the top quartile in customer reliability or CAIDI and a residential electric bills are more than 20% below the national average.Story continuesAnd amidst the backdrop of significant commodity increases this year, Xcel Energy's 4,500 megawatts of owned wind farms continued to be an industry-leader in net capacity factor performance, generated approximately $1 billion of fuel-related customer savings in 2022 and almost $3 billion since 2017. Our nuclear fleet remains the top performing fleet in the country and achieved a capacity factor of 96% last year. We had an active regulatory year and resolved multiple rate cases in Uri storm cost recovery proceedings. Commissions in Minnesota and Colorado approved resource plans that will add nearly 10,000 megawatts of utility scale renewables to our systems through this decade. The Minnesota Commission approved our 460 megawatts Sherco Solar project, the Colorado Commission approved our $2 billion Power Pathway transmission project and MISO awarded us $1.2 billion of transmission projects and we accelerated our timeline for transitioning out of coal and now expect to be coal free by the end of 2030, all of which contribute to our leadership in clean energy transition for our customers.We continue to lead in carbon reduction as well. 2022, our estimated carbon emissions were approximately 52% below 2005 levels and we remain on track to achieve 80% carbon reduction across the company by 2030. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will reduce the cost of renewables for our customers, improves cash flow and credit metrics for the company and enhances the competitiveness of our renewable offerings. Continue to execute on our electric vehicle vision, implementing multiple new programs for our customers. We also filed comprehensive transportation plans in Minnesota and Wisconsin that are pending commission approval. We've advanced our ESG leadership and have been recognized by multiple entities, including an upgraded rating by MSCI from AA to AAA.And finally, we remain among the world's most ethical, admired and responsible companies and we're recognized for being the best veteran employer as well for our disability inclusion in the workplace. I'm really proud to lead a team that can deliver on operational, financial, environmental and diversity goals, all simultaneously. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for sustainable organic growth over the next decade, including affordable renewable additions in our resource plans, the transmission needed to enable those carbon-free resources and responsible community transitions as we retire coal plants. We've recently issued a requests for proposals in Minnesota, Colorado and at SPS seeking approximately 6,000 megawatts of new renewable generation, a portion of the 10,000 megawatts that have been approved in our jurisdiction.We'll submit our recommended portfolios of generation assets to our commissions by the middle of this year and anticipate decisions in the second half of this year. We also expect to issue additional RFPs in Minnesota and Colorado this year and next year for the remainder of our approved needs. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that we have a geographical advantage in the clean energy transition due to the strong wind and solar resources in our service territory. This access to low cost renewable energy should also give us further advantage in developing green hydrogen and other clean fuel projects, which are becoming more feasible as a result of federal support from the Infrastructure and Jobs Act and the IRA. Late last year, we submitted hydrogen hub concept papers for both the Rocky Mountain and the Upper Midwest regions to the Department of Energy to compete for awards from the $8 billion hydrogen hub program.In December, we received favorable notice from the DOE for our concepts and we're encouraged to submit full applications in April. In addition, our pink hydrogen production pilot at our Prairie Island nuclear generating station is expected to be operational this year. Finally, we expect to bring forward opportunities this year to utilize clean fuels and green hydrogen blending at both our gas-fired generation stations and in our gas network for Home and Building heating. As we continue to utilize innovative technologies to decarbonize our business, we are well-positioned to take advantage of potentially significant hydrogen capital investment opportunities in the future. As the penetration of renewable assets in our states increases, we're also interested in pursuing advanced storage opportunities to balance our electric system needs.Today, we're excited to announce a new partnership with Form Energy to develop two long-duration energy storage pilot projects. Form Energy's 100-hour battery technology could be a critical component to our decarbonization strategy providing the resiliency and reliability that we need on the system to support our significant renewable portfolio. We plan to deploy a 10 megawatts multi-day storage system at a retiring coal plant in both Minnesota and Colorado. These projects are expected to be online as early as 2025. And as we wrap up, I want to thank the thousands of employees who worked in below zero temperatures, sustained high winds in several feet of wet, heavy snow, keep the lights on and the houses warm during our recent winter storms.Your efforts exemplify our company values of connected, committed, trustworthy and safe, and I believe that our dedicated employees and partners are what distinguishes Xcel Energy with our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian.Photo by David Thielen on UnsplashBrian Van Abel: Thanks Bob. Good morning, all. We had another strong year recording earnings of $3.17 per share for 2022 compared with $2.96 per share in 2021. This represents EPS growth of 7.1%, slightly above our long-term growth rate target of 5% to 7%. The most significant earnings drivers for the year included the following; higher electric and natural gas margins increased earnings by $1.05 per share, primarily driven by regulatory outcomes and riders to recover capital investments. In addition, a lower effective tax rate increased earnings by $0.15 per share, but keep in mind, production tax credits lowered the ETR, PTCs are flowed back to customers through lower electric margin are largely earnings neutral. Offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense which reduced earnings by $0.40 per share reflecting our capital investment program, higher O&amp;M expense which decreased earnings by $0.24 per share, higher interest expense and other taxes, primarily property taxes, decreased earnings by $0.23 per share and other items combined to reduce earnings by $0.12 per share.Turning to sales, our weather-adjusted electric sales increased by 1.8%, largely due to higher C&amp;I sales driven by strong economic activity in our service territories. We anticipate a modest slowing of our sales with growth of 1% in 2023. Shifting to expense, O&amp;M expenses increased $170 million for the year, driven by cost related to technology and customer programs, storms, vegetation management inflation and additional actions due to weather. We also invested in our employees, ensure we retained our top talent. While we expect inflationary pressures to remain, we continue to focus on our continuous improvement programs, which we expect to drive increased productivity and efficiency. As a result, we anticipate O&amp;M expenses will decline approximately 2% in 2023.We made progress on a number of regulatory proceedings. In the Minnesota Natural Gas rate case, the ALJ recommended the commission approve our settlement which reflects a rate increase of $21 million, an ROE of 9.57% and equity ratio of 52.5%, the decoupling mechanism and a property tax tracker. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. In the Minnesota electric rate case, the commission accepted our proposal to reduce our requests from MISO capacity revenue and establish our tracker. Hearings were completed in December and we continue to meet with the parties to see if we can reach a constructive settlement. However, we have a strong case and are comfortable with a fully litigated outcome absent this settlement. We anticipate a commission decision later in 2023.In November of 2022, we filed an electric rate case in Colorado seeking a net increase of $262 million based on an ROE of 10.25% and equity ratio of 55.7% in a 2023 forward test year. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the third quarter. We also filed a New Mexico electric rate case seeking a rate increase of $78 million based on an ROE of 10.75%, equity ratio of 54.7%, the forecast touch here in the early retirement of the Tolk coal plant. We anticipate a commission decision and implementation of final rates in the fourth quarter. As far as future filings, we plan to file our Texas rate case later in the quarter and Wisconsin in the second quarter. As we have discussed in the past, the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant customer benefits, key elements include the following; tax credit transferability will provide $1.8 billion of liquidity increasing cash flow and reducing equity needs.We've met with companies in our service territory and expect to enter into bilateral tax credit sale contracts later this year. Our FFO to debt metrics improved by 100 basis points during the forecast period, the solar PTC and tax credit transferability improve the competitiveness of our renewable bids and we anticipate pricing will decline in solar projects by 25% to 40% in wind projects by 50% to 65% due to the new and extended tax credits, which is great for our customers as we embark on this clean energy transition. Finally, we don't anticipate any material impact from AMT as a result of makers' depreciation and existing tax credits on our balance sheet. We are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance range of $3.30 to $3.40 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 5% to 7%.We have updated our key assumptions to reflect actual year-end results which are detailed in our earnings release. With that, I'll wrap up with a quick summary. We had a strong operational and financial year in 2022. We delivered 2022 earnings within our guidance range, the 18th consecutive year and increased our dividend for the 19th consecutive year. We received approval of our research plans in Colorado and Minnesota, which results in approximately 10,000 megawatts of new renewables. The Inflation Reduction Act has passed a significant benefits for our customers in the company. We are reaffirming 2023 guidance, consistent with our long-term earnings growth rate. We remain confident we can continue to deliver long-term earnings and dividend growth within the upper half of our 5% to 7% objective range as we lead the clean energy transition and keep bills low for our customers.This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now take questions.See also 11 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in 10 Years and 11 Most Undervalued Bank Stocks.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Our full year adjusted EPS of $7.85, adjusted segment operating profit of $6.6 billion, and trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC of 13.6% demonstrate once again the great work of our global team of dedicated colleagues who manage unprecedented market disruptions to deliver an outstanding year. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $5.3 billion. This strong cash flow and the disciplined management of our balance sheet allow us to continue to reinvest in our business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures and return cash to shareholders.Story continuesIn total, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2022. Next slide, please. With the expectation of continued strong cash flow, today, we are announcing a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. We are proud of our record of 91 years of uninterrupted dividends and 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. And I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued support of ADM. Next slide, please. When I examine 2022, our ability to drive structural growth in earnings and improvement in ROIC was supported by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise, particularly the progress we made on our productivity and innovation objectives. Our productivity work in 2022 included enhancing our operational resilience, including through stabilizing our plant operations and streamlining our operating systems.In order to meet growing customer demand and drive efficiencies, we delivered multiple projects to enhance our operational footprint, from modernization to improving and scheduled downtime to capacity expansions. We completed our Marshall, Minnesota modernization, opened a new mill house in Clinton, completed our Quincy refinery expansion and improved output and yields at our Rondonopolis diesel plant in Brazil. We also continued to optimize our North American milling footprint. As you know, we also introduced a new $1 billion challenge in 2022. There is no clearer demonstration of how our colleagues and culture are driving returns than the fact that thousands of ADM team members from around the globe took the initiative, step up and identified opportunities that unlocked more than $1.6 billion in cash in 2022.On innovation, our accomplishments include a focus on capturing the benefits of organic growth investments and M&amp;A as we continue to get closer to our customers and extend our capabilities to meet growing global demand for our products. Our Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry, with 18% constant currency revenue growth for the full year. We delivered an impressive 26% in year-over-year revenue growth in BioSolutions. The portfolio of acquisitions we made in the prior year continued to deliver OP above our financial projections and we advanced targeted production capacity expansions to meet growing customer demand. We announced expansions of our alternative protein capabilities in Decatur, Illinois, and starch production in Marshall, Minnesota.We completed our alternative protein expansion in Serbia and are able to launch our expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain. And we continue to expect our joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota to be operational by this year's harvest. Slide 6 please. Now let's look ahead. We have a robust plan for driving enduring value creation in 2023 and beyond. In productivity, our work has a common theme, changing the way we work by standardizing, digitizing and automating our manufacturing plants and our offices alike. I previously mentioned our successful Marshall modernization. That was the blueprint for our wider work to unlock value across our production footprint through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics.We have now approved the scope for the first 2 years of the program, encompassing 18 manufacturing facilities. We continue to expect double-digit returns from this important initiative. And we are continuing to advance 1ADM, which is enabling us to improve our processes and expand capabilities across the value chain. 2022 was an important year for our 1ADM business transformation. We completed several rollouts and we are seeing benefits in areas ranging from indirect procurement to go-to-market strategies to grain merchandising. In 2023, we will continue to expand the breadth and scope of this work, which is empowering our businesses to deliver profitable revenue growth and higher margins. Next, we are focused on maintaining our structural growth momentum via our innovation work.As you might recall, we have spoken in the past about our strategic growth platforms: sustainability, differentiated grain, alternative proteins, BioSolutions, microbial solutions and microbiome modification. These growth opportunities go through a natural evolution. When new, we launch them at the corporate level. As they mature, they become more embedded in our businesses. Differentiated grain is now firm part of our Ag Services and Oilseeds segments everyday work. BioSolutions is growing within carbohydrate solutions. Alternative proteins and microbiome are pillars of nutrition. With these efforts maturing in the businesses, we are able to focus on other opportunities. One of the most important is decarbonization, which is a critical component of our sustainability growth platform and is driving the evolution of our carbohydrate solutions business.Our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity of our assets and value chain in order to be the preferred partner in low-carbon intensity feedstocks for a growing demand base. We have made several announcements to mark milestones towards this goal in recent years, including our regenerative agriculture efforts, which enrolled 1 million unique acres over the past year; our Strive 35 goals; our initiatives to connect and expand our carbon capture and storage capabilities; and our heat and energy project indicator. We are looking at multiple other pathways to reducing our carbon intensity, like more sustainable energy sources for our facilities. And our efforts aren't just in the U.S. We have plans for other regions as well, including some EMEA projects we hope to speak about in the future.All of these projects contribute to our ability to offer low carbon intensity feedstocks and that is allowing us to continue to advance our work to transition our dry mills to produce sustainable aviation fuel; help scale up the scaled food products with new sustainable attributes, like the ingredients we will sell to Pepsi from the regenerative agriculture agreement we announced last year, and propelled the expansion of BioSolutions with joint ventures like with LG Chem. And even as we advance our decarbonization plan, we are always looking at new ways to help solve our world's challenges for food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, we are continuing to explore opportunities around precision fermentation, which we used to call microbial solutions, in which microbes rapidly grown in fermenters fed by dextrose, transform the sugars into a wide variety of products for food, feed and fiber.That's a longer term horizon for ADM, but it gives us a hint of the kind of opportunities we see in the years ahead. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?Vikram Luthar: Thank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 7. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year with substantially higher year-over-year results in Q4. Ag Services results were higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Low water conditions reduced North American export volumes, partially offset by the South American team, which executed well to deliver higher margins and volumes. Global trade results were lower than the strong fourth quarter of 2021 with lower ocean freight results partially offset by higher results in EMEA origination and destination marketing. The business benefited from a $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Reserve Louisiana Export facility. Crushing results were more than double those of the prior year period.In North America, strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins. In EMEA, oil demand powered strong rapeseed margins more than offsetting higher energy costs compared to the prior year. Expanding margins drove negative timing impacts in the quarter of approximately $40 million. RPO results were significantly higher year-over-year as the business continued to execute well to meet demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the U.S. and biodiesel globally. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, we expect AS&amp;O results for Q1 to remain strong, similar to last year's very strong quarter led by continued strength in crush margins and RPO.Ag Services is likely to be lower year-over-year, particularly in light of very strong global trade results in the prior year quarter. Slide 8, please. Carbohydrate Solutions had a strong 2022, with full year results higher than 2021. For the quarter, results were substantially lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 due to pressured industry ethanol margins. The starches and sweeteners sub-segment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher year-over-year results. The North America business delivered solid volumes and strong margins in both starches and sweeteners, partially offsetting lower ethanol margins. The EMEA team effectively managed risk and delivered improved results on better margins in a continued dynamic environment.The global wheat milling business delivered higher margins driven by solid customer demand. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower as higher ethanol inventory levels pressured margins especially compared to the very strong margin environment in the fourth quarter of 2021. Looking at the first quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions, we expect continued solid demand and strong margins for starches, sweeteners and wheat flour. Ethanol margins are currently pressured due to high industry inventory levels. If industry stocks come back down, results for the quarter could be similar to Q1 of 2022. If margins remain pressured, results would likely be lower. On Slide 9, the Nutrition business continued its strong growth trajectory in 2022.pipeline,storage tanks and buildings of a refinery - industrial plant for fuel productionADM demonstrated that it remains the provider of choice in Nutrition for systems as our growing pipeline and continued strong win rates delivered full year revenue growth of 18% on a constant currency basis. The business continued to outperform industry growth levels and delivered 11% higher profits for the full year on a constant currency basis. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew 11% on a constant currency basis. Q4 operating profits were significantly lower than the prior year quarters. Human Nutrition results were lower than those of the fourth quarter of 2021. Flavors results were similar to the prior year as strong revenue growth helped offset demand fulfillment challenges. Specialty Ingredients continued to see strong demand for its product portfolio, including plant-based proteins, offset by inventory adjustments.Health &amp; Wellness was higher year-over-year, driven primarily by the bioactives portfolio, including the results from the Deerland acquisition. Animal results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the lower margins in amino acids, driven by recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet Nutrition volumes were lower in Latin America, partially driven by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results were stronger driven by APAC and Latin America partially offset by the impact of softer demand in EMEA. As we look ahead, we expect overall Nutrition results in Q1 to be lower than the prior year's record first quarter, with Human Nutrition delivering similar year-over-year results on strong flavors and SI growth and lower Animal Nutrition results primarily due to weaker margins in amino acids.I want to take a moment to expand on our view of Nutrition in 2023. Nutrition is expected to continue on a positive growth trajectory for full year 2023, including 10% plus profit growth and a similar level of revenue growth. The growth is likely to be led by Human Nutrition and to be weighted in the back half of the year as the first half will see headwinds in Animal Nutrition due to the continued impacts of weaker margins in amino acids and because we will see increasing recovery in demand fulfillment as we move through the year. Slide 10, please. Other business results for Q4 was significantly higher than the prior year's fourth quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM investor services, and captive insurance experienced favorable underwriting results and lower claim settlements versus the prior year.In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $299 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence related to growth initiatives. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year primarily due to higher contributions from foreign currency-related hedge activity and lower railroad maintenance expense. Corporate results also included losses related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Wilmar exchangeable bond and severance totaling $6 million. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates. We expect corporate cost for 2023 to be around $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expense.Other business performance should be higher than 2022, offsetting a significant portion of the increased corporate costs as higher interest rates positively impact our ADM IS business. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 16% compared to 21% in the prior year. The decreased rate was driven primarily by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings in addition to lower discrete tax expense versus the prior year. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 17%. For 2023, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 16% and 19%. Next slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $5.3 billion are up significantly versus $3.9 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 25%, and we continue to have ample available liquidity.Our strong cash flows and balance sheet have enabled continued investment in the business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for the full year. We currently plan to maintain capital expenditures at about $1.3 billion in 2023 and continue to have significant financial capacity to pursue strategic growth objectives. We have been continuing to return capital to shareholders. We distributed $900 million in dividends and repurchased almost $1.5 billion of shares in 2022. We are planning $1 billion in opportunistic buybacks for 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan?Juan Luciano: Thank you, Vikram. Next slide, please. 2022 was a truly outstanding year for ADM. As we look forward to 2023, we expect another very strong year. There are a number of market factors that we see as relevant for shipping our performance. We still see tightness in supply and demand balances in key products and regions. We see strong demand for vegetable oil, driven largely but robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Resilient food demand should drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling. We see continued strong demand for ethanol, including positive discretionary blending economics. And as Vikram mentioned, we expect 10% plus constant currency OP growth from Nutrition. We have a strong playbook powered by our deep expertise and our unparalleled footprint and capabilities to manage a dynamic market environment.Our healthy balance sheet provides ongoing optionality as we continue to pull the levers under our control to deliver results. And we expect positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company that will help us drive value in 2023. Taken together, we expect to deliver another very strong year in 2023.

74,0c826696-7cc3-3635-9156-d3a2ed7d686b,MNST,2023-01-28,Diageo (DEO) 1H FY23 Earnings & Sales Rise on Strong Demand,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/diageo-deo-1h-fy23-earnings-154603735.html,1674834363,STORY,['MNST'],"[Diageo plc DEO reported interim results for the first half of fiscal 2023, ended Dec 31, 2022, wherein pre-exceptional earnings per share improved 15.2% year over year to 98.6 pence (in local currency). This was backed by robust sales growth, organic operating margin expansion, productivity savings and favorable currency impact.Although the company predicts a challenging operating environment for fiscal 2023, it remains confident of the resilience of its business and its ability to navigate through these headwinds. The company is confident about the long-term growth potential of the total beverage alcohol sector and expects to expand its value share by 50% in the sector to 6% by 2030.The company notes that it is on track to deliver on its medium-term guidance for fiscal 2023-2025, wherein it targets organic sales growth of 5-7% and organic operating profit growth of 6-9%.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 13.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 4.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research 1H FY23 HighlightsOn a reported basis, net sales increased 18.4% year over year, driven by strong organic growth and favorable currency effects. Organic net sales were up 9.4% year over year due to growth across all regions. The company’s diversified footprint, advantaged portfolio, strong brands and favorable industry trends of premiumization aided top-line growth.Organic volume improved 1.8% year over year. Price/mix grew 7.6% year over year, reflecting a high-single-digit price contribution to net sales growth. The company’s premium plus brands contributed 57% to net sales growth and 65% to organic sales growth. Its super-premium-plus brands aided organic net sales by 12%.In North America, Diageo’s largest market, sales accelerated 19% year over year on organic sales growth of 3% and strength across all markets. On a year-over year basis, DEO witnessed sales growth of 13% in Europe, 20% in the Asia Pacific, 9% in Africa and 34% in Latin America and the Caribbean.Strong growth in Europe was driven by organic growth of 10% and the hyperinflation adjustments related to Turkey. Sales in the Asia-Pacific reflected gains from strength across most markets, notably South East Asia, Travel Retail Asia and the Middle East and India. Growth across all markets, supported by price increases, aided sales growth in Africa. Latin America and the Caribbean sales growth reflected gains in Brazil, Central America, and the Caribbean and Mexico, mainly on price increases and premiumization.On a year-over year basis, Diageo also reported substantial growth across most categories, with growth of 28% slated for tequila, 19% for scotch, 10% for Spirits, 5% for Rum, 9% for beer and 8% for ready-to-drink. However, Vodka sales declined 2%. Gains in the beer business were driven by growth across all regions and double-digit growth of Guinness in Ireland, Great Britain and North America.The reported operating profit improved 15.2% year over year due to an improved organic operating profit and the positive impact of currency rates. The reported operating margin declined 92 basis points (bps) as the aforementioned gains were more than offset by exceptional operating items, acquisitions and disposals and other items.Organic operating profit rose 9.7% year over year, with the organic operating margin expanding 9 bps. Organic operating profit benefited from leverage in operating costs, driven by disciplined cost management, despite inflation. Moreover, growth was driven by supply productivity savings and price increases, which more than offset the higher cost inflation on the gross margin. Organic operating margin also reflected strong operating margin expansion in the Asia Pacific and Europe, partially offset by a decline in North America.Story continuesFinancialsIn the first half of fiscal 2023, Diageo delivered net cash from operating activities of £1,248 million, marking a decline of £699 million year over year. DEO reported strong free cash flow of £817 million, down £758 million from the last-year level due to strong working capital outflow, higher cash tax and interest, as well as increased capital investments.Diageo is committed to its disciplined approach to capital allocation, primarily to enhance its shareholder value. DEO increased the interim dividend 5% to 30.83 pence per share. This reflects its strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term health of its business.Additionally, Diageo expects to complete the remaining £0.3 billion of share repurchases as part of the return of capital program of up to £4.5 billion in February 2023. Further, it expects incremental share buybacks of £0.5 billion in fiscal 2023.For fiscal 2023, the company expects capital expenditure of £1-£1.2 billion. Moreover, it expects to report strong free cash flow in the second half of fiscal 2023 compared with the first half due to the lapping of more normalized working capital outflows witnessed in the second half of fiscal 2022.Fiscal 2023 OutlookIn North America, the company expects organic net sales growth to normalize through the second half of fiscal 2023 compared to double-digit growth in the year-ago period. In Europe, organic net sales growth is likely to moderate in the second half of fiscal 2023 as the company’s laps the on-trade channel re-opening and recovery in the prior year. The company anticipates continued organic net sales growth for the Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa in the second half of fiscal 2023, although at a moderated pace relative to strong growth in fiscal 2022.The company expects to continue its revenue management initiatives, including pricing actions, throughout fiscal 2023, to overcome the challenging inflationary environment. It expects marketing investment to increase more than sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2023. The company anticipates the organic operating margin to benefit from continued premiumization trends, everyday efficiencies and operating expense leverage, offset by strong investments in marketing.The company estimates the tax rate before pre-exceptional items to be 22-24% in fiscal 2023. The effective interest rate is likely to be 4% in fiscal 2023.Looking for Solid Stocks?

(NYSE:LUV) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 26, 2023Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. . At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Ryan Martinez : Thank you, operator and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then leave plenty of room for Q&amp;A. Joining me on the call today is our President and CEO Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson, Executive; Vice President and CFO Tammy Romo, and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green. A quick reminder, that we will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectation of future performance. And our actual results could differ from expectations. Also, we had special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to our press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information. And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.Bob Jordan : All right. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, we're disappointed to report a Q4 net loss, as we were on track to produce a healthy fourth quarter profit prior to December 21. We provided an 8-K investor update earlier this month that quantify the preliminary estimate of the financial impacts, so a Q4 loss is likely not a surprise. But I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the operational disruptions. And first and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and all their holiday plans. We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event, again, like we had last month, and we are highly focused on our customers and our plan going forward.Story continuesAnd customer refunds and reimbursements remain a top focus. While not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs. Well, in terms of the events themselves, we canceled more than 16,700 flights from December the 21 to the December 31. The first few days through December the 23 were specific to the winter storm, and we began to have additional disruptions in the operation on December the 24. As the largest carrier in roughly half of the top 50 U.S. travel markets, we were impacted by rolling storms to an extraordinary degree. We experienced gridlock and many of our largest airports along with a high frequency of short notice cancellations, which created urgent and repeating efforts to repair the aircraft routings and then our pilot and flight attendant schedules.Given the overwhelming volume of flight cancellations over multiple days, combined with manual workstreams, we determined that the best course of action to get back on track operationally was to reduce our December 27 through December 29 flight activity by roughly two thirds. And that allowed us time to reset the operation to normal flight levels beginning on December the 30. But based on what we know at this point, our processes and technology generally worked as designed. But we were hit by an overwhelming volume of closing cancellations, which put us behind and creating crew solutions, which in turn pushed us to manual efforts and solutions and Andrew will cover that in detail more here in just a minute. So we've got several streams of work underway.Immediately following the disruption, we move swiftly to put mitigation efforts in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and to help fortify our operational resilience. We created an early indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals and alert if we approach predefined operational thresholds. We established supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to support crew recovery efforts at the first sign of a potential workload backlog. We enhanced our existing tools for crew members to communicate electronically to crew scheduling during irregular operations. And we're in the process of swiftly updating and upgrading our crew recovery tools and system to solve the backlog repair of crew member schedules, which was one of the key issues during the disruption.Where the short term risk mitigation steps in place are underway, we're taking additional steps to review the events and determine any additional changes to our plans. We worked early on with a board of directors and they've established an operations review committee that is working with our management to understand the events and help oversee the company's response. We've engaged a third-party global aviation firm Oliver Wyman, for a third-party assessment of the event and help make recommendations of additional mitigation elements for us to consider. And that work will conclude here over the next several weeks. And with that assessment and our own, we will reassess our 2023 plans, keeping in mind that we already had a robust operational modernization plan in place for 2023 and Andrew will walk you through that in greater detail as well.I want to reiterate that Southwest has a very long history of innovation and continuous improvement. We've been investing up to $1 billion per year on technology, both recurring and investments been included and we have implemented numerous large scale technology and business projects over the past five years, including things like the first implementation of the Amadeus Reservation System in North America, co-developing an innovative network planning system. That's now part of the Amadeus product portfolio, ETOPS certification and processes for Hawaii flying, new aircraft maintenance systems, a DDS platform capabilities and connection to three other platforms, a new pair product, and automated ancillary services capabilities, and we're in the process of wrapping up the replacement of our revenue management system, which actually involves three RM systems simultaneously in production, which is an absolute technical feat.That list is not meant to be comprehensive, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what we've done and what's underway. We're also currently budgeted to spend $1.3 billion of our 2023 annual operating plan on investments, upgrades and maintenance of our IT systems, which is higher than what we spent in 2022. The recent disruptions will likely accelerate some of our plans to enhance our processes and technology, but I suspect that the operational modernization opportunities that Andrew outlined at Investor Day have largely captured the key workstreams and we will dedicate the capital needed to execute in a timely and efficient manner. We currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans. We were properly staffed for 2022 flight schedules including the holidays and we continue hiring this year to be properly staffed We currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans.We were properly staffed for our 2022 flight schedules, including the holidays, and we continue hiring this year to be properly staffed for our 2023 flight schedules. Our plans call for adding over 7,000 new employees in 2023, which is actually a decrease of nearly 40% from 2022 hiring levels. We have the order book from Boeing that we need in 2023. And with the short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, we believe we are well prepared to execute our network restoration plans this year. Nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets. And that network restoration should significantly help our operational resilience efforts over the long term. Andrew will also cover that in more detail.Finally, we continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people. And I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to reach agreements with several of our unions recently, including our flight instructors, our facilities maintenance techs, our customer service agents and, just earlier this week, a tentative agreement with our dispatchers. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our ramp and ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants. And we intend, as always, to have competitive market compensation packages for our people. In closing, we still made tremendous progress in 2022. And despite some impact here in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are holding ourselves accountable to the plans that we outlined at our early December Investor Day, and it is still our goal to achieve the long-term financial targets that we outlined.And I know that our people are up to the task. I'm just extremely proud of them for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines, and they remain absolutely our greatest asset, the heart and soul the company and a tremendous source of pride for me personally. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.Andrew Watterson : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will focus the majority of my comments on the operational disruptions to provide some additional color to what Bob shared. We experienced a historic event with a combination of challenges we hadn't experienced before. However, as Bob mentioned, our crew scheduling software didn't stop working during the disruptions, but a combination of our processes and the technology couldn't keep up with the pace of cancellations at the height of the weather disruption. That forced crew scheduling into fully manual mode to develop solutions, and they simply couldn't keep up with the volume of changes. Based on what we know today, it appears that the last domino to fall was when we could no longer use our automation for crew scheduling.Automation works very well for us, but when a problem gets stated, the automation doesn't have the ability to look backward as it tried to solve future problems. To simplify, the decision support tool helps us solve two issues. One, repair the assignments of individual crew members; and two, solve crew coverage problems for individual flights by reassigning crew members and using reserve crew members. If a crew member's individual schedule is not repaired before the next assignment begins, then we aren't able to use the automation to repair the individual schedule. Consequently, without updated crew member schedules, the software can't reassign crew members to solve for flights with crew coverage issues. So the disruption uncovered a functional gap in our technology.However, this issue is in the process of being addressed. In terms of the moving parts of our point-to-point network, you can think of it in 3 buckets. You have the flight network, the aircraft network and the crew network. We feel very confident in the flight network and schedules we have published for sale, and we are very adequately staffed to operate our fourth quarter flight schedules. We feel very confident in our aircraft network, and we have a sophisticated technology product that we call the Baker that produces new aircraft solutions during irregular operations. At no time during the disruption did the point-to-point journeys of the aircraft present us with an unsolvable problem. For our crew network, the functional gap that was revealed in our crew scheduling software is in the process of being addressed and should be updated in a matter of weeks, which represents quick work by GE Digital and our teams to address the most notable cause of the event that we are currently aware of.So in terms of where we go from here -- this happen again, our access fall into three buckets: immediate mitigation efforts aimed at the last domino to fall; department level assessments and actions; and a systemic review supported by a third-party. Bob covered the immediate mitigation for implemented, our dashboard, supplemental staffing, crew communication tool enhancements, et cetera. He also covered a third-party review of the events and the Board's involvement in working with management to oversee our response. I want to briefly cover the second bucket, which is department actions. Each department has undertaken its own analysis to identify additional measures the departments can make to improve its management of significant disruptions while leaving the cross-departmental improvements to the systemic analysis conducted with a third party.Some examples of the department efforts include implementing a new crew scheduling phone system targeted for Q1 of 2023, create a network disruption pod and NOC, or network operation control center, to better integrate crew data and to fly cancellation decisions; increased the number of crew schedulers;, evaluate our cold weather preparedness and items such as assessing VIP procedures, protocols and tools to increase throughput; ensuring we have sufficient ground support equipment fuel that is viable in subside temperatures. This list isn't meant to be comprehensive either. Just to share you -- just to share with you that we have already identified some smaller scale opportunities for improvement. And we will have taken actions even before we get to the third-party recommendations.But in terms of the review by Oliver Wyman, we think it is a valuable exercise to understand how the accumulation events led us to the final result. And we still want to see if there are opportunities to improve performance on bad weather days to integrate and to our modernize operation efforts. We recently had an opportunity to test some of the new mitigation efforts implemented recently during the FAA technology outage earlier this month with a Notice to Air Missions or NOTAM system. Our NOC worked around the clock in constant contact with the FAA and the industry to make sure that our NOTAM was restored and valid before we pushed any of our flights. We took the time to ensure verification, safety and compliance, which is why we had not dispatched flight before the FAA ground stop.And it is another example that we will not sacrifice safety. We did not sacrifice safety during the December event, the NOTAM event, and we simply won't going forward. Safety is paramount. And we used our new warning indicators. We deployed additional head count to assist crew scheduling, even though we didn't end up needing them. And we executed target cancellations that help protect how we ended that day to assure a good start the following morning. So while we had a difficult start to that day, thanks to the swift actions taken and enhanced processes in place, we were number one in the industry in on-time performance the next day. Part of the organizational changes when I stepped into the Chief Operating Officer role was to combine network planning with the operations functions in order to further align commercial and operations objectives.And we recently announced a related org change by promoting -- VP network planning, to SVP network planning and network operations control. The goal of this move is to create a tighter feedback loop between scheduled design and schedule execution in order to add resiliency and reliability to our network. This is another action that I believe will help us tremendously. Since the disruptions in late December, our operational performance has been solid. The month of January has seen several ATC outages, historic precipitation in California, where we are the largest carrier, and multiple snowstorms in Denver. Through Monday 23, we are number two in on-time performance out of 10 airlines, trailing American Airlines by less than 1 percentage point.As a reminder of what we shared at Investor Day, I want to recap two areas: our operations focus areas and our capacity plan. First, much of what we are talking about in terms of operational improvement and technology upgrades, I addressed at our December 7 Investor Day. In particular, in the areas of operating quality and frontline staff and tools. In the area of operating quality, I noticed a focused area called network design recovery. While it was not planned as part of our 2023 delivery at that point, we had begun work in that area at the time of Investor Day. We had already selected over Wyman to assist us beginning this January. As part of our reevaluation of our 2023 priorities, we'll accelerate this work. In the area of frontline staffing tools, I noted focus areas of mobility/digital tools and continuous improvement.Again, these were specifically slated to deliver by the end of 2023 but will be evaluated again as part of the reassessment of our plans, given the challenges with crew communications we experienced. I want the third-party review to conclude before I opine on what exactly needs to be done and over what time line, but we have good line of sight to potential improvements in several operations areas that span multiple years, including 2023. Now we need to finalize our plan for 2023 and determine what sequence of improvements are most appropriate in terms of technology and tools investment. And secondly, our 2023 capacity growth is now up to 16% to 17% year-over-year, but this is apples to apples in line with the old 15% that we outlined in Investor Day.Nothing has materially changed in our capacity plans for this year. The increase is simply due to lower capacity in Q4 2022 due to the flight cancellations. We were headed all along toward network restoration, and the December events had nothing to do with staffing levels or our capacity plans. Speaking to 2023 capacity plans, it is nearly all going back in the key Southwest markets and adding market depth. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansions in the pandemic. And as leisure demand remains strong and business demand improves, we have opportunities to build this back up. And this is lower risk capacity growth primarily in markets where we have the number one or number one share in a strong Southwest Airlines customer base.Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done. And in doing so, it should help fortify the operation with better itineraries, depth and reaccommodation options for customers, crews and aircraft when we do have weather or delays that create regular operations. So we plan to continue our investment in the network this year. And on the topic of 2023 schedules, last month, we extended our flight schedule for sale from July 11 to August 14. This included the -- in the Southwest points of strength as well as bringing back longer-haul markets, all part of our continued network restoration and accounts for anticipated travel demand for the peak summer travel period. Denver grew at just over 300 flights a day, the highest ever daily total account for any Southwest Airport, and Baltimore hits approximately 220 days departures, which is higher than summer 2019.We will peak with total daily flights of nearly 4,400 in July 2023. Our next schedule through October 4 will be published on February 9. I want to wrap up by reiterating that we are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating the type of operational event we had last month. And we are also focused on moving forward and running a great operation each and every day. So while there will be lessons learned, we aren't losing focus on the fact -- on the blocking and tackling that is necessary to efficiently operate our network. I'm confident that our people will continue to do just that, and I'm thankful for their focus on running a safe and reliable operation and providing excellent customer service to our customers. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't commend the negotiating teams of TW 557 who represent our flight instructors; and AMFA, who represents our facilities maintenance technicians.These negotiating teams worked tirelessly to reach agreements for their memberships, and I am pleased we can reward these employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality-of-life enhancements. I'm also pleased that we just recently reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, who represents our flight dispatchers, and they will be voting on their TA soon. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups that await a tandem agreement to vote on, and we intend to continue to pay competitive market compensation packages to our employees. So with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.Tammy Romo: Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional comment on our 2023 outlook. As a result of the operational disruptions in late December, driving a $620 million negative after-tax net impact, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $226 million, excluding special items. These results are clearly disappointing and not where we expected to be. Our quarterly performance leading up to December 21 was strong and trending in line with our previous guidance expectation aside from CASM-X, which I will cover in a minute. As Bob mentioned, we still made tremendous progress in 2022 despite the operational setback in late December generating full year 2022 net income of $723 million, excluding special items.Despite the negative revenue impact from the flight cancellations in December, we generated record fourth quarter operating revenues. Brian will speak to our revenue performance and outlook here shortly, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuel, our fuel hedge performed well last year, especially in a volatile market environment. In total, our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit was roughly $950 million with roughly $170 million in fuel expense savings in fourth quarter alone. For 2023, we are 56% hedged in first quarter, 51% hedged in the second quarter and 47% hedged in second half 2023, which equates to 50% hedged for the full year. Based on the January 20 forward curve, we now estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, up $0.25 from our previous guidance and our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, up $0.05 from our previous guidance.Our first quarter guidance includes $0.16 of hedging gains and a hedging premium expense of $0.06 per gallon. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 39% hedged with a fair market value of nearly $561 million in total for 2023 and 2024. We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 with the goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection. Moving to our non-fuel cost. We experienced a significant cost increase in fourth quarter primarily as a result of the December operational disruptions, including a lower capacity from the flight cancellations. The year over three-year negative impact to fourth quarter CASM, excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, our CASM-X was 23 points.In addition to the impact from lower ASM, the majority of this headwind was driven by the estimated redemption value of rapid reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers. There was also premium pay and additional compensation for employees, but that made up a much smaller portion of the 23-point CASM-X impact. Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, our fourth quarter CASM-X was roughly 4 points higher than the high end of our previous guidance range of up 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. This was primarily due to additional labor accruals at year-end. As a reminder, we have been accruing for all open labor contracts since April 1, 2022, and these accruals are dynamic as we continuously evaluate market compensation.Looking forward, we continue to experience year-over-year inflationary cost pressures as well as cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels. We now estimate first quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year, which is approximately 2 points higher than our previous guidance of flat to up 2%. This 2-point increase is due to the continuation of premium pay for a portion of January relating to the December operational disruptions as well as an increase in labor accruals for open contracts. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year compared with previous guidance of down 1% to 3%. The vast majority of the change in guidance is related to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 capacity as well as higher fourth quarter 2022 cost attributable to the December 2022 operational disruption.We have also increased our labor accruals this year, which results in a slight offset year-over-year. Putting aside the effects of the December operational disruptions, we continue to expect our second half 2023 CASM-X trends to improve from first half 2023 year-over-year. Turning to our fleet. We ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which is net of 26-700 retirements. We received a total of 68 aircraft deliveries from Boeing MAX 8, which was two more than our previous expectation of 66 aircraft. However, we are still short 46 aircraft from the 114 contractually scheduled 2022 MAX deliveries due to Boeing supply chain challenges and the timing of the -7 certification. These 46 orders are reflected as 2023 deliveries in the order book included in our press release this morning.However, we don't expect to be caught up on MAX deliveries by the end of this year. We continue to expect 100 MAX-8s this year, which remains our planning assumption, and we continue to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft which will bring our fleet count to 843 at the end of this year. We have also recently exercised options for delivery in 2024, as outlined in our press release. Our full year 2022 CapEx was $3.9 billion, relatively in line with our previous guidance. In regards to our CapEx plans for this year, we continue to estimate spend to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Bob and Andrew touched on our current thoughts regarding technology spend this year in light of the operational disruption.But I want to reiterate that we are focused on executing our operational modernization plans outlined at Investor Day, which includes our current expectation to spend approximately $1.3 billion this year, including both capital and recurring spend on technology investments, upgrades and system maintenance. And our total CapEx range should allow for additional CapEx investments as needed. Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion after paying a total of $3.1 billion to retire $2.9 million in principal of debt and finance lease obligations during 2022. This includes the $1.2 billion principal prepayment of our 2023 notes, which leaves a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments this year.Our leverage is at a very manageable 47%, which we expect to decline over the next several years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges. While the last several weeks have been tough, we have not lost sight of the priorities and focus areas that we outlined at Investor Day. In addition to the operational modernization plans we already mentioned, we are eager to wrap up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Although it's disappointing, we expect another loss in first quarter this year due to a carryover revenue drag from the operational disruption, we remain steadfast in our focus to generate consistent quarterly profitability.And even with the first quarter headwinds, our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. Furthermore, we remain determined to achieve our long-term financial targets to grow our profits, margins and returns while delivering on our commitment to provide outstanding customer service and reliable operations that have been a source of tremendous pride over our 51-year history. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.Ryan Green : Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide a bit more detail on fourth quarter trends and our revenue outlook for first quarter. First, as Bob mentioned, we are very focused on taking care of our customers impacted by the operational disruptions last month. We've sent gestures of goodwill. We processed all bags for return to customers. We processed nearly all customer refunds and have completed more than 80% of the reimbursement requests we've received from customers for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. We're processing the remaining requests as quickly as possible and plan to have those largely completed by next week. We will continue working hard every day until all requests are resolved. Turning to our trends.At our Investor Day in early December, we shared that our fourth quarter revenue outlook remains strong. Leisure revenue trends were strong, both in load factors and yields and for both holiday and nonholiday time periods. Managed business revenues also continue to be strong, and all of that held true right up to the operational disruptions that began on December 21, and we were tracking right in line with our operating revenue guidance to that point. But in the last 10 days of the month, we incurred an estimated $410 million revenue penalty due to the operational disruptions. As the end of December is typically a low demand period for business travel, we experienced less of an impact on business travel trends than with leisure. We still came in at the better end of our managed business revenues fourth quarter guidance range at down 20% compared with fourth quarter of 2019.And despite the $410 million impact, we still generated record fourth quarter revenues of $6.2 billion and a record passenger yield of $0.177. We saw other positive contributors in the fourth quarter from our loyalty program with fourth quarter records and new co-brand card acquisitions and retail sales. In addition, we benefited from the continuation of increased take rates for upgraded boarding, and our portfolio of new cities and development markets also performed in line with expectations in fourth quarter, absent the event. So in all, there was plenty to be encouraged by in terms of underlying trends in the fourth quarter. We continue to feel good about our 2023 revenue plan. Admittedly, we are starting off first quarter with a $300 million to $350 million headwind, which we assume is attributable to the operational disruptions in December.However, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, and we believe the vast majority of the first quarter impact is isolated to January and February travel. For March 2023, leisure booking and yield trends appear strong and in line with what we would expect from a high-demand travel month. And based on recent improvements in close-end booking trends, we expect March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Beyond that, we expect that our GDS and Southwest business initiatives will provide the opportunity to grow managed business revenues sequentially beyond March. So we are optimistic about both the improving sequential trends we're seeing as well as the early read on March bookings. And based on these trends, we currently expect first quarter operating revenues to increase in the range of 20% to 24% year-over-year.And then finally, while we have limited visibility further out on the booking curve, we continue to see no noticeable signs of a slowdown in macro travel demand and our booking trends. Our commercial focus areas and initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day remain unchanged. We continue to focus on driving value from network restoration, new market maturation, Southwest business and GDS, our new fare product, revenue management system modernization and in-flight customer experience enhancement. In closing, I want to acknowledge that we are mindful that we have a few new headwinds in 2023, both on the revenue and the cost side. And as a result, we will continue to work even harder on our revenue plans and revenue generation this year. Ultimately, we need to offset higher costs, and revenue is part of that equation.We still believe there is strong demand ahead of us, and we're encouraged by the revenue trends we currently see in March. So with that, I turn it back over to Ryan Martinez.Ryan Martinez: Thank you, sir. We have analysts queued up for questions.

79,be594b92-f7ec-3f1c-b269-4939e479d328,LUV,2023-01-28,Southwest’s CEO and CFO face investors for the first time following the holiday travel deluge,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-ceo-cfo-face-investors-122933296.html,1674822573,STORY,['LUV'],"[Good morning,Southwest Airlines celebrated the holidays with flight cancellations, computer system issues, and dissatisfied customers. And it was costly. In Q4 2022, the airline incurred an $800 million pre-tax negative impact on earnings. There was a net loss of $220 million, or $0.37 loss per diluted share.One of the hardest things for a CEO and CFO to do after a disappointing quarter is address investors in an earnings call. However, in the case of Southwest Airlines, it was also important to address the fact that customers were stranded in airports and employees had to stand on the frontline during the days of chaos.“When I consult clients, I start with their values,” says leadership expert Nicole Price, CEO of Lively Paradox, a professional coaching business. “I professionally believe that it was the right decision [by Southwest] to make amends for operational errors,” Price explains. “Southwest openly states: 'Our focus on people includes giving the same concern, respect, and care to each one of our people, whoever they are.'” And these values are said to be people over profit-based, not the reverse, she says.“First and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and all their holiday plans,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday’s earnings call. “We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event.” The company is focused on reimbursements and refunds, he said. Southwest has also given travelers affected 25,000 frequent-flyer points. “While I’m not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs,” he said.Jordan has offered multiple apologies to customers and employees since the massive flight disruptions. The airlines canceled more than 16,700 flights from Dec. 21-31, he said on the call. On Dec. 20, Southwest (NYSE: LUV) closed at $36.39, and at $36.60 on Dec. 21. The low for the time period was $32.19 on Dec. 28. LUV closed at $35.70 on Thursday.Story continuesThe first few days of disruption through Dec. 23 were specific to the winter storm, then Southwest began having additional disruptions in the operation on Dec. 24, Jordan said. The airlines had difficulty with crews and airplanes that were far from where they should have been. The software used couldn't keep up with the volume of changes resulting in manual crew scheduling, according to Southwest.“It’s the CEO's responsibility to answer in this way as this issue wasn’t a financial one, it was an operational one,"" Price says.Regarding finance, Price also listened to Southwest CFO Tammy Romo’s remarks on the call with investors and gave me her assessment. “What worked was that she stuck to the facts of the situation,” Price explains. “She shared those facts in a logical and reasonable way. The explanations did not sound like excuses—just explanations.”Romo joined Southwest in 1991 and held several financial leadership positions before becoming CFO in 2012. The Q4 earnings results are “clearly disappointing and not where we expect it to be,” she said on the call. Performance leading up to Dec. 21 was “strong” and trending in line with previous guidance expectations, Romo said. Southwest generated a full year 2022 net income of $723 million, excluding special items, she said. The company has allotted $1.3 billion for a technology spend, which includes upgrades and ongoing maintenance of the system, Romo said.A significant cost in the quarter was driven in part by ""the estimated redemption value of rapid reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers,” she explained. Romo said the balance sheet remains strong.“I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges, she said.Price’s coaching has a particular focus on practicing empathy in leadership. “Investors struggle to concern themselves with empathy when there’s a profit loss,” she says. However, if Romo wanted to have a more empathetic response she could have reminded the audience of Southwest’s values and aligned the decision to compensate customers to those values, Price says. In addition, Romo could have “found a way to connect the intangible value of customer sentiment to projected sales (she mentioned March projections look good),” Price says.Southwest is testing software fixes created after the operational disruption. The airline has also hired consulting firm Oliver Wyman to review its processes. Now that the earnings call is over, the next group of people Southwest's C-suite will need to talk to is the U.S. Department of Transportation, which has launched an investigation into December’s chaos.Announcement: Next week, CFO Daily is diving deep into what it takes to become a CFO. Please forward this to someone you know who is destined for the top job and encourage them to sign up here.Have a good weekend.

The ETF is also above both its 50-day EMA and 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average). If SPY can trade and hold above this downtrend it may be a strong signal that the market is on the verge of a new bull market.If the market does breakout, one place to invest will be stocks with improving earnings. Utilizing the Zacks Rank, we can identify stocks with earnings expectations being revised higher, improving our odds of buying market-beating stocks. Alternatively, even if the market doesn’t breakout, stocks with upward earnings momentum should provide some downside risk protection.Technical AnalysisTechnical analysis is a valuable tool for investors, providing them with the ability to identify entry and exit points for improved risk-reward outcomes. While it may not have the ability to predict the future, it remains one of many indications for investors to consider.The 50-day EMA is still below the 200-day EMA. Technical traders often use the 50/200 EMA crossover as a filter for the long-term trend of the market. With the 50-day still below the 200-day EMA, we may still consider the market in a downward trend. However, if price does trade above this breakout level, it may very well initiate the EMA crossover signal.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor CorporationNucor Corporation NUE is a manufacturer and seller of steel and steel products. Nucor’s steel mills produce specialty steel products including hot rolled, cold rolled, galvanized sheet steel, and beam blanks among many others. More recently, Nucor is experiencing strong growth in the non-residential construction and the heavy equipment market. Nucor has been expanding its production capacity through strategic acquisitions, bringing the total facilities up to 123 in Canada and the United States.  Nucor stock has been on a tear over the last two years, up 248% over that period, trouncing the broad market, and significantly outperforming the Steel-Producers industry average. According to Zacks estimates, it looks like this rally could be set to continue.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNUE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating a strong trend higher in earnings revisions. Interestingly, the steel market and Nucor’s earnings expectations are not particularly enticing for the coming quarter, as sales and earnings are projected to shrink -26% and -53% respectively, but FY expectations are beginning to turn in a big way.While the current quarter earnings expectations have been revised lower over the last 90 days, the current year has seen the opposite. FY23 earnings have been revised from $11.01 per share 90 days ago to $12.96 today. And they have been revised higher over every time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther boosting the stock, is Nucor’s buyback program, which has purchased 3.1 million shares over the last quarter and 20.6 million over the last year. NUE has returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends over the last year. NUE stock currently yields a 1.2% dividend.Nucor has a 1 year forward P/E of 13.4x, above the industries average of 9.5x, and above its ten-year median of 10.5x.Phillip Morris InternationalPhilip Morris International PM is a manufacturer and seller of cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine related products outside of the US, in 180 countries. In 2008 the company was spun off from Altria Group MO, although Philip Morris US still functions as a subsidiary of Altria Group. Additionally, PM shares a licensing agreement with MO for the sale of IQOS (non-combustible tobacco product) in the United States.The tobacco and now smoke free giant has outperformed the industry and the broad market over the last year. This outperformance is due in part to PM’s strong pricing power and its successful shift to smoke free products. Notably, smoke free products, also referred to as RRP (reduced risk products), sales have jumped 12% over the last quarter, and now make up 30% of total revenue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhilip Morris currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a strong history of upside earnings surprises. Earnings estimate revision on the face look a bit mixed, but over the next year are being upgraded. Current quarter expectations have been revised just slightly lower from $1.33 per share to $1.29 per share over the last 90 days, but next quarter estimates are being revised higher. Additionally, next year’s estimates have seen more significant revisions, up to $5.91 per share vs $5.65 90 days ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPhilip Morris has a one year forward P/E of 17.6x, just below the S&amp;P’s average of 18.2x, and above its five-year median of 15x. PM stock also offers a very nice dividend payment, yielding 4.9%.Cleveland-Cliffs Cleveland-Cliffs CLF, formerly Cliffs Natural Resources, is another Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). CLF is the largest producer of steel pellets in North America, and largest producer of flat rolled steel in its region. CLF primarily sells products to integrated steel companies in Canada and the United States, and owns mines in Minnesota and Michigan.Cleveland-Cliff earnings estimates have seen some very interesting trends in revisions and should be looked at closely in the table below. Current quarter earnings have been mostly revised lower over the last 90 days, which of course isn’t encouraging. But next quarter, current year, and next year earnings have all been revised significantly higher over the last 30 days. Next quarter, you can see was first revised lower from $0.37 to just $0.06 per share, but was then higher up to $0.25. You can see the same trend, a revision lower 60 days ago followed by revisions higher 30 and 7 days ago, in current year and next year. An interesting, and promising development for the steel producer.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCLF currently has a one year forward P/E of 10x, above its 5-year median of 6x, and below its Mining sub-industry of 12x. CLF stock has had a volatile last five years, oscillating between strong outperformance, and deep underperformance against the broad market, somewhat typical of commodities companies who experience strong cyclical tendencies. Based on Zacks figures, it seems likely that the recent period of outperformance may continue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionThe broad market is at a precipice. Either it breaks out above this technical pattern or reverses lower and shakes all the newfound market bulls. While these three stocks should perform well in a new bull market, thanks to Zacks analysis, they will likely also perform well if the market remains shaky. Zacks earnings revisions are a strong indication of individual stocks with potential to outperform the market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It may not have been easy to hold on to HCA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?HCA Healthcare's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at HCA Healthcare's main business drivers.Effective May 8, 2017, the company’s name was changed to HCA Healthcare, Inc.  from HCA Holdings, Inc. It is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the U.S. Headquartered in Nashville, TN, it operates hospitals and related health care entities.At the end of 2021, the company operated 182 hospitals and approximately 2,200 ambulatory sites of care, including surgery centers, freestanding emergency rooms, urgent care centers and physician clinics, in 20 states and the United Kingdom.The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. It operates in two geographically organized groups – the National and American Groups.The National Group includes 96 hospitals across Alaska, California, Florida, southern Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.The American Group includes 79 hospitals across Colorado, northern Georgia, Kansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas. The company also operates six hospitals in England that are included in the Corporate and Other group.The company's general, acute care hospitals with 48,030 licensed beds provide a wide range of services to cater to different medical specialties, such as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics as well as diagnostic and emergency services. As of Dec 31, 2020, HCA Healthcare’s five psychiatric hospitals with 593 licensed beds offered a full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in HCA Healthcare ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $6,752.78, or a gain of 575.28%, as of January 27, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 170.16% and the price of gold increased 11.71% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for HCA.HCA Healthcare’s shares have outperformed the industry in a year. Revenues are bouncing back, courtesy of a surge in admissions, outpatient surgeries and other procedures. Multiple buyouts aided it in increasing patient volumes, enabled network expansion, added hospitals to its portfolio and boosted business scale. Revenues are estimated to grow by 3% year over year in 2022. The company has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. As of Sep 30, 2022, it had $3.1 billion left under its buyback authorization. However, the company's escalating operating expenses have been weighing on the margins. A lowered 2022 guidance for earnings per share ($16.40-$17.60, a fall of 19.7% from the 2021 figure) remains a concern. Also, declining operating cash flows indicates weaknesses in operations. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Shares have gained 6.02% over the past four weeks and there have been 1 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

And by the way, when you do, you're not going to always get it right,"" Solomon said at the World Economic Forum's annual gathering last week.He then reeled off Goldman's growth numbers: average revenues up 44% over a three-year period, a 39% jump in book value per share since 2019 that outpaced peers and a bigger dividend than rivals.The company is being ""prudent"" on expenses by laying off thousands, Solomon said. It will also shed some of the $59 billion of alternative investments that weighed on earnings.But shareholders want to know more about the Wall Street giant's plans after results fell short of expectations and one unit lost $3 billion over three years.Solomon offered few specifics on future strategy, but those details may come at the company's investor meeting on Feb. 28 in New York.""Investors remain skeptical,"" said Joe Rava, an equity analyst at abrdn, which owns shares in the bank.David Konrad of Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods was one of several analysts who recently cut Goldman's share price target, noting that it suffered from ""a perfect storm of declining revenues in a challenging market.""And for UBS analyst Brennan Hawken, who rates Goldman at neutral, the idea of buying the stock on expectations of a higher price-to-earnings ratio ""is really, really hard right now.""Story continuesStill, Goldman shares are up 3.6% over the past year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 banking index and peers.Since taking the helm in 2018, Solomon has tried to diversify Goldman beyond its traditional powerhouses of trading -- which languished after the 2008 financial crisis -- and investment banking. But those divisions have become even more dominant, comprising 69% of the firm's revenue at the end of last year, versus 58% the year Solomon took over.The CEO also championed Marcus, a retail banking business that faltered even as it attracted more than $100 billion in deposits.The company slashed Solomon's pay by 29% to $25 million for 2022. It cited a ""challenging operating environment,"" but also noted his ""effective leadership,"" according to a filing.Goldman's moves into consumer lending and transaction banking were ""head scratchers,"" said Kush Goel, senior research analyst at asset manager Neuberger Berman, which owns the bank's stock. Instead, it should have followed rival Morgan Stanley, which earns a steady stream of income from wealth-management fees, he said.Goldman's asset and wealth management unit generated 34% of its revenue in the fourth quarter, while Morgan Stanley derived 63% of its revenue from comparable divisions.""Goldman Sachs has set a very clear strategic direction,"" said Tony Fratto, a company spokesman. The bank ""is making strong progress on that vision"" by bringing in greater fees from asset and wealth management, maximizing its position in banking and markets, and seeking pretax profits for platform solutions, he said.Goldman's strengths in dealmaking and trading also make it more vulnerable to economic and market volatility than competitors, said Hawken at UBS.Solomon, who rose to the top job from investment banking, said that division is ""doing great,"" despite fees falling 48% last year as deals dried up. ""There's no capital markets opportunity -- that's not permanent,"" Solomon said.In October, Goldman scaled back ambitions for Marcus by placing it under the newly-merged asset and wealth division. It also swept parts of the business into a new unit called platform solutions, which houses transaction banking, credit cards and financial technology.While platform solutions made up only 3% of Goldman's revenue, it accounted for about 64% of the $2.72 billion the bank set aside last year for potential credit losses. The company said it was required to boost provisions to meet accounting standards.David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said ""investors will probably need some hand holding"" to see the path to greater profits.Jim Lebenthal, a partner at Cerity Partners who manages client portfolios including shares of the Wall Street behemoth, said it should play to its strengths.""Going back to what has made Goldman great for decades will allow the firm to reset and recover,"" he said.(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen and Saeed Azhar; Additional reporting by Niket Nishant and Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Anna Driver)]"

Davidson Sr. Research Analyst Linda Bolton Weiser joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss quarterly earnings for Hasbro and Mattel, what’s next for Hasbro’s digital gaming business, job cuts, consumer spending, and the outlook for the toy sector.Video Transcript- Hasbro announced layoffs yesterday. The Rhode-Island-based company will cut as many as 1,000 jobs. It's a sign of uncertainty, of course, outside of tech.For more on what this means for the toy sector ahead of Hasbro's fourth quarter report, let's get to DA Davidson's Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Linda Bolton Weiser. Linda, it is good to see you.So Hasbro, of course, the layoffs are only part of the story. They also gave a pretty dismal forecast for the fourth quarter. And it seems like, bottom line, they're just not selling as many toys. What's going on here?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, in fact, the toy demand in the United States is actually pretty strong. Through the first nine months, point of sale at retail was up in the low single digits against a really strong year last year.So the problem is more with inventory reductions by retailers. So when there were shortages of toys last Christmas and 2021, the retailers really stocked up a lot in the first part of 2022. And then by the time the summer rolled around and consumer demand was a little bit pinched because of inflation, then they had too much inventory.So it's not so much the health of consumers buying toys. It's more the retailer inventory reductions that has caused the low sales performance, the sales declines from the toy companies.- Linda, what role is Mattel playing in just the disappointing results over at Hasbro? Mattel has been doing better, I would say, at least the past three quarters fundamentally compared to Hasbro.LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Yeah, Mattel went through a turnaround and restructuring a few years ago and is generally in much better health right now. But Mattel is well will have down sales in the fourth quarter. So they're not immune to the retailer inventory reductions. But in general, Mattel has been healthier.Story continuesAnd, of course, Hasbro now is not really so much a toy company. 60% of Hasbro's profit comes from their Wizards and Digital Gaming business.- Is Wizards and Digital, frankly, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is that enough to really kind of be the bridge for Hasbro here?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, in the fourth quarter, their Wizards and Digital Gaming segment was actually up 22% year-over-year. So they did have a very favorable comparison. They had some launches. So it was the toy division that had the biggest decline, which was down over 25% in the quarter.- Linda, Hasbro has really been dragged on various YouTube toy channels and on social media on how it's been operating that Wizards business. Do you think they have permanently ruined it?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, no, we're still optimistic about the long-term growth of the Wizards business, which is Magic-- The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons. And they did exhibit really strong growth of over 20% in the fourth quarter, which, I think, is evidence of the long-term health of that business.- Is there a continued shift right now in kind of a consumer spending pullback, if you will, of some of those discretionary dollars? Is there more of a shift from toys to tablet? And what I mean by that is kind of this tabletop playing to playing on a tablet and digital gaming instead. And how does that impact a company in Hasbro and perhaps the broader toy segment?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, in terms of their Wizards and Digital Gaming business, in terms of that whole segment, actually, about 80% of the revenue is still tabletop. So that really shows you that Magic-- The Gathering, for example, is largely still played with actual physical cards. So that's still a very important part of it.And really little children, little infant babies don't play with tablets and electronic devices as much. And the consumption curve for toys by age has already shifted down to a very low age. That occurred 10 or 15 years ago. So that's not really a negative impact on the toy industry at this point.- Linda, what does this tell us about anything about how Mattel is going to do or is doing?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, both companies, Hasbro and Mattel, had lowered their guidance previously for the fourth quarter. Mattel has announced their reporting date. And they haven't preannounced a disappointment.So we're hopeful that Mattel can actually do better. They've exhibited a lot more control over being able to forecast their financial results than Hasbro has recently. So we're optimistic they can at least come within the range, sort of, of what the Street is expecting. But that is for the declines in the fourth quarter. So it's really affecting Mattel as well. But you can see that the Mattel share price is not even down so much today because I think people recognize the difference a little bit between Hasbro and Mattel.- All right, DA Davidson Analyst Linda Bolton Weiser joining us this morning. Thanks so much. We'll see if some of the movie and entertainment content is enough to move some more of those toys as well here this year. We appreciate your time this morning.]"

Thank you for joining Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. Your host will be Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Kowlzan. Please proceed when you are ready.Mark Kowlzan: Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Again, I'm Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today is Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our packaging business; and Bob Mundy, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin the call with an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'm going to be turning the call over to Tom and Bob, who'll provide further details. And then I'll wrap things up, and we'd be glad to take questions. Yesterday, we reported fourth quarter 2022 net income of $212 million or $2.31 per share. Excluding special items, fourth quarter 2022 net income was $215 million or $2.35 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 net income of $262 million or $2.76 per share.Fourth quarter net income -- fourth quarter net sales were $1.98 billion in 2022 and $2.04 billion in 2021. Total company EBITDA for the fourth quarter, excluding special items, was $409 million in 2022 and $463 million in 2021. Excluding special items, we also reported full year 2022 earnings of $1.04 billion or $11.14 per share compared to 2021 earnings of $894 million or $9.39 per share. Net sales were $8.5 billion in 2022 and $7.7 billion in 2021. Excluding special items, total company EBITDA in 2022 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 net income included special items primarily for certain costs at the Jackson, Alabama mill for paper to containerboard conversion-related activities. Details of all the special items for the year 2022 and 2021 were included in the schedules that accompanied the earnings press release.Story continuesExcluding special items, the $0.41 per share decrease in fourth quarter 2022 earnings compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lower volumes in our Packaging segment $1.14 and Paper segment $0.02. We also had higher operating costs of $0.48, primarily from inflation on energy, chemicals, labor and benefits, supplies, repair materials and services and other indirect and fixed costs. Freight and logistics expenses were unfavorable $0.13 along with higher depreciation expense, $0.09, higher converting costs, $0.06 and higher scheduled maintenance outage expenses of $0.01. These items were partially offset by higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment of $1.18 and Packaging segment -- and Paper segment rather of $0.21.A lower share count resulting from share repurchases $0.08; lower interest expense, $0.04 and a lower tax rate, $0.01. Results were $0.13 above the fourth quarter guidance of $2.22 per share, primarily due to higher prices and mix in the Packaging segment, lower freight and logistics expenses, a lower share count resulting from share repurchases and a lower tax rate. Looking at our Packaging business. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $392 million with sales of $1.8 billion resulted in a margin of 21.7% versus last year's EBITDA of $461 million and sales of $1.9 billion or a 24.5% margin. For the full year 2022, Packaging segment EBITDA, excluding the special items, was $1.8 billion with sales of $7.8 billion or a 23.8% margin compared to full year 2021 EBITDA of $1.7 billion with sales of $7.1 billion or a 23.9% margin.Demand in the Packaging segment was below expectations for the quarter, causing us to run our containerboard system to these lower demand levels. Our employees did a very good job with their cost management and process optimization efforts at these lower production rates to offset the negative volume impact. Total economic-related downtime for the fourth quarter was approximately 231,000 tons. The scheduled maintenance outage and conversion work at our Jackson, Alabama mill was completed successfully during the fourth quarter, and we restarted the mill earlier this month after being down as a result of the lower demand. The number three machine achieved its first phase design capacity and is producing a very high-quality virgin linerboard. However, based on current containerboard demand levels, we decided to move the second phase of the conversion work from this spring to next year in 2024.I'll now turn it over to Tom, who will provide further details on containerboard sales and the corrugated business.Thomas Hassfurther: Thank you, Mark. Domestic containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix together were $1.19 per share above the fourth quarter of 2021 and flat compared to the third quarter of 2022. Export containerboard prices and mix were down $0.01 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and down $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022. Corrugated product shipments were down 8.7% per work day and down 10.2% in total with 1 less workday compared to last year's fourth quarter. Outside sales volume of containerboard was 131,000 tons below last year's fourth quarter and 38,000 tons below the third quarter of 2022. The lower demand in our Packaging segment was driven by several items. The inventory correction in both boxes and our customers' product has been more prolonged than what we originally anticipated at the start.Inflationary pressures on the consumers have also added to the problem by reducing the consumers discretionary spending capabilities. In addition, consumer behavior changed very quickly as we exited the extreme COVID period, resulting in more of a preference towards travel, entertainment and experience versus that of tangible goods. Containerboard and box demand continues to be negatively impacted from the deterioration in U.S. and global economic conditions, rising interest rates and a cooler housing market. As we move from the fourth quarter into the first quarter, we estimate the rate of shipments per day to be fairly similar as we expect many of these conditions to continue. However, there are 4 additional shipping days in the first quarter, so total actual shipments will be higher when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.In spite of the numerous issues currently impacting demand, we continue to perform at levels above pre-COVID and anticipate our first quarter shipments to exceed first quarter 2019 shipments by approximately 6% on a per day basis. Now I'll turn it back to Mark.Mark Kowlzan: Thanks, Tom. Looking at our Paper segment. EBITDA, excluding special items in the fourth quarter was $39 million with sales of $154 million or a 25.7% margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 EBITDA of $26 million on sales of $143 million or an 18.4% margin. For the full year 2022, Paper segment EBITDA, excluding special items, was $132 million with sales of $622 million or 21.3% margin compared to the full year 2021 EBITDA of $72 million with sales of $600 million or a 12% margin. Prices and mix were up 21% from last year's fourth quarter and moved 3% higher from the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to implement our previously announced price increases. Sales volume was about 11% below last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to paper sales from the Jackson Mill's #1 machine, which we included in last year's results as well as having -- we optimized our product and customer mix since that time as we transitioned away from paper volume at Jackson mill.As expected, volume was down approximately 11% versus the seasonally stronger third quarter of 2022 and that also included the remaining inventory from the Jackson mill. The management team and all of the employees of the Paper business have done a tremendous job over the last several quarters to optimize our inventory, product mix and cost structure in order to deliver outstanding results for 2022, and I'm confident that we can maintain this momentum through 2023. I'll now turn it over to Bob.Robert Mundy: Thanks, Mark. Cash provided by operations during the quarter totaled $420 million with capital expenditures of $247 million and free cash flow of $173 million. Other cash payments during the fourth quarter included dividend payments of $116 million, cash tax payments of $56 million and net interest payments of $31 million. We also spent $380 million during the quarter to repurchase just over 3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $126.70 per share. That brings our total repurchases, over the last 5 quarters, to almost 5.5 million shares at an average price of $130.62 per share. Repurchases of our outstanding stock and dividend payments made during the past year, represent 63% of cash from operations or 91% of net income that was returned to shareholders in 2022.For the full year 2022, cash from operations was $1.5 billion. Capital spending was $824 million, with free cash flow of $671 million. Our final recurring effective tax rate in 2022 was 24.5%, and our final reported cash tax rate was 20%. Regarding full year estimates of certain key items for the upcoming year, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $475 million, and DD&amp;A is expected to be approximately $485 million. We estimate dividend payments of $450 million and cash pension and post-retirement benefit plan contributions of $53 million. Our full year interest expense in 2023 is expected to be approximately $72 million and net cash interest payments should be about $74 million. The estimate for our 2023 book effective tax rate is 25%.Currently, planned annual maintenance outages at our mills in 2023, including lost volume, direct costs and amortized repair costs, it's expected to be in total, $0.67 per share versus $0.99 per share in 2022. The current estimated impact by quarter in 2023 is $0.11 per share in the first quarter, $0.14 in the second, $0.22 in the third and $0.20 per share in the fourth quarter. I'll now turn it back over to Mark.Suwin/Shutterstock.comMark Kowlzan: Thank you, Bob. The hard work of our employees, along with strong relationships between us and our customers and suppliers delivered outstanding results for PCA in 2022. New annual company records were achieved for revenue, cash from operations, net income and earnings per share. And as Bob just mentioned, 91% of our net income was returned to our shareholders from dividend payments and stock repurchases. We successfully completed or substantially completed significant cost reduction and process improvement projects at our mills including a 30-megawatt steam turbine and first phase of the #3 machine conversion to containerboard at the Jackson mill. This effort included fiber flexibility projects at the Wallula and Jackson Mills and many other key initiatives.We also completed numerous high return and high efficiency improvement projects in our corrugated products plants that will allow us to better optimize our entire packaging business for the future and deliver profitable growth and mix enhancement opportunities for our customers and shareholders. The significant capital investments we've made during the year had complete involvement of PCA personnel from project conception, preliminary and detailed engineering, all the way through to project implementation and start-up. These projects and initiatives achieved numerous tactical and strategic benefits while improving our industry-leading return on invested capital to just under 20%. As we've discussed on these calls many times before, by the end of 2022, we would be winding down several years of significant strategic capital investments that position us very well to meet the future needs of our many customers in a very cost-effective manner.We also finalized the optimization of our paper business while delivering excellent financial results that we expect to sustain us well into the future. As economies around the world continue to deal with numerous issues and uncertainties, virtually every individual industry is being negatively impacted in some manner. At PCA, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet which provides the financial flexibility to react quickly to most situations or opportunities in the future. We will also continue our commitment of a balanced approach towards capital allocation in order to maximize our profitability and returns to our shareholders. Looking ahead, as we move from the fourth and into the first quarter in our Packaging segment, as Tom mentioned, we expect box demand on a per day basis to be similar to the fourth quarter levels, although we expect higher total volume with corrugated products plants having 4 additional shipping days.Prices will move lower as a result of recent decreases in the published domestic containerboard prices and we're assuming lower export prices as well. Paper prices should move slightly higher with sales volume fairly flat. Labor costs and certain indirect costs will increase as some containerboard mill operations were temporarily idled during the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate higher labor and benefits costs and other timing-related expenses that occurred at the beginning of a new year as well as higher prices for many chemicals, particularly starch and caustic soda. However, we expect lower wood and recycled fiber prices, lower energy prices and lower scheduled maintenance outage expenses. Lastly, we expect higher interest and nonoperating pension expenses and a higher tax rate, but we will see some benefit from our recent share repurchases.Considering these items, we expect first quarter earnings of $2.23 per share. With that, we'd be happy to entertain any questions, but I must remind you that some of the statements we've made on the call constituted forward-looking statements. The statements were based on current estimates, expectations and projections of the company and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including the direction of the economy and those identified as risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K and in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. And with that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions, please.See also 11 Best Aluminum Stocks To Buy and 15 Biggest Nursing Home Companies in the US.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,246 million.The lower-than-expected fourth-quarter 2022 results were caused by higher operating and customer engagement costs. Weakness in International Card Services and Commercial Services businesses affected profit levels. The negatives were partially offset by continued business momentum, better volumes and higher Card Member spending. AXP added 3 million proprietary cards in the quarter.The company intends to hike dividends by 15% to 60 cents per share, starting from the first quarter of 2023.American Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American Express Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | American Express Company Quote Q4 Operational PerformanceDue to higher spending, network volumes jumped 12% year over year to $413.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Total interest income was $3,965 million in the fourth quarter, up 65% year over year.

Setting aside such a huge amount is expected to help the company navigate through a volatile global economy.Total expenses of $11,278 million increased 15% year over year, primarily due to higher client engagement costs, a significant amount of net loss on Amex Ventures equity investments and higher compensation expenses in the reported quarter.Segmental PerformancesThe U.S. Consumer Services segment recorded a pre-tax income of $1,286 million for the fourth quarter, witnessing a marginal increase from $1,281 million a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense increased to $6,523 million from $5,294 million in the prior-year period, courtesy of a rise in Card Member spending and increased net interest income.Story continuesThe Commercial Services segment delivered a pre-tax income of $547 million, which decreased 24% from a year ago. Total revenues net of interest expense were $3,557 million, which climbed from $3,091 million, attributable to higher Card Member spending.The International Card Services segment recorded a pre-tax loss of $15 million for the fourth quarter against a pre-tax income of $40 million a year ago, due to the strengthening U.S. dollar.

109,a07bd883-913c-3bae-ad9c-8db9b2223aba,HOLX,2023-01-28,"Hologic, Inc. (HOLX) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hologic-inc-holx-hits-fresh-141502209.html,1674828902,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Have you been paying attention to shares of Hologic (HOLX)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $82.96 in the previous session. Hologic has gained 10.9% since the start of the year compared to the -17.1% move for the Zacks Medical sector and the -25.8% return for the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on October 31, 2022, Hologic reported EPS of $0.82 versus consensus estimate of $0.62.For the current fiscal year, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $3.49 per share on $3.83 billion in revenues. This represents a -42.03% change in EPS on a -21.21% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $3.95 per share on $4.06 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.06% and 6.09%, respectively.Valuation MetricsHologic may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Hologic has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 28.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.6X versus its peer group's average of 17.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Hologic currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Hologic fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Hologic shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does HOLX Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of HOLX have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is iRadimed Corporation (IRMD). IRMD has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of C, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. iRadimed Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 20.83%, and for the current fiscal year, IRMD is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share on revenue of $53.37 million.Shares of iRadimed Corporation have gained 27% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 28.58X and a P/CF of 42.07X.The Medical - Instruments industry is in the top 37% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for HOLX and IRMD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The consensus estimate suggests a year-over-year rise of 47.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues of $34.3 billion indicates a 2.2% improvement from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteIn the December-end quarter of 2022, the demand for refined petroleum products improved significantly due to continued growth in fuel consumption. Being one of the world’s largest refiners, Phillips 66 is likely to have benefitted from higher demand for its refined petroleum products in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is expected to have reaped the rewards of a better macro environment in its downstream business. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for realized refining margin on a worldwide basis is pegged at $21.04 per barrel, indicating an increase from the year-ago reported level of $11.60 per barrel. This is likely to have positioned Phillips 66 for huge profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Phillips 66 this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. As you can see, that is not the case here.Story continuesEarnings ESP: Phillips 66 has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are currently pegged at earnings of $4.34 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Phillips 66 currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies from the Energy space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarterly reports:PBF Energy Inc. PBF currently has an Earnings ESP of +9.17% and a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PBF Energy is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 16.

117,d0a3df52-36cc-3db3-9c3e-d32b0a2635ea,PSX,2023-01-28,7 Undervalued Income Stocks to Buy in January,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-income-stocks-buy-210415831.html,1674594255,STORY,"['SNA', 'UMC', 'AFL', 'PSX', 'SWK', 'BTI', 'RHI']","[Although the wild volatility of 2022 delivered some tempting market ideas for the new year, investors should also make some room for undervalued income stocks to buy. Fundamentally, dividend-paying enterprises offer tremendous relevancies because they help keep your portfolio right side up. And because of last year’s downpour, investors can scoop up quality names for cheap.Moving forward, it’s possible that the Federal Reserve could ease off its monetary tightening policy or perhaps slash interest rates. Such an action would likely spark upside mobility in risk-on asset classes, thereby rewarding growth-oriented enterprises. However, this projection isn’t guaranteed, which is why undervalued income stocks to buy remain intriguing.Besides, hurtling toward another ambiguous environment, anything can happen. You can mitigate some of the unpleasantries with the undervalued income stocks to buy listed below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRHIRobert Half$79.24AFLAFLAC$72.68SNASnap-on$241.17UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.84SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$87.69PSXPhillips 66$106.95BTIBritish American Tobacco$38.22Robert Half (RHI)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comUnder strained market environments such as the present juncture, you must take what Wall Street gives you. For instance, one of the hot topics – that’s actually a downer – in the economy right now is mass layoffs. With many high-paying white-collar jobs suffering the corporate axe, the resumes will start flying. Invariably, in my view, this circumstance should benefit the employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI).To be sure, RHI hasn’t enjoyed a great performance in the market. In the trailing year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Nevertheless, it’s one of the undervalued income stocks to buy. Again, the fundamental backdrop favors Robert Half. Increasingly, we may see rising desperation among white-collar workers, thus driving demand for the company’s services.Story continuesFinancially, the market prices RHI at nearly 13 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 15.8 times. As well, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics and a decently stable balance sheet. Though Robert Half’s forward yield of 2.16% isn’t anything to write home about, it’s also a very dependable payout.AFLAC (AFL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA specialist in the field of supplemental insurance, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) represents a boring business. Still, boring businesses tend to make solid candidates for undervalued income stocks to buy. Moreover, the wild events of the coronavirus pandemic will likely support rising demand for Aflac’s protective solutions.Essentially, the Covid-19 crisis forced Americans (and citizens of other privileged nations) to pop their delusional bubbles. No longer will once-in-a-century pandemics remain the exclusive domain of the foreign and exotic. Instead, Covid-19 made us all realize that the smelly stuff can roll downhill very quickly. And while we can’t do much about random catastrophes, we can protect ourselves financially.Aside from a great story, AFL objectively ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices Aflac shares at a trailing multiple of 9.13. For comparison, the sector median stands at 12.83 times.Finally, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.35%. No, it’s not the most generous yield but it’s a reliable payout. Indeed, the company features 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Snap-on (SNA)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAnother arguably boring idea, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) probably doesn’t get much airtime. However, that could change soon. With the Biden administration focused on repairing and revamping the nation’s various infrastructure networks, Snap-on could soar in relevance. Per the company’s public profile, it manufactures and markets high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry.While so many publicly traded securities stumbled in 2022, SNA did largely the opposite. In the trailing year, Snap-on gained over 13% of equity value. Further, in the company’s most recent third-quarter earnings report, it topped earnings and revenue estimates. Interestingly, analysts rate SNA a consensus moderate buy. And their average price target implies an upside potential of over 15%.Currently, the market prices SNA at both a trailing and forward multiple of 14.5. For both metrics, Snap-on trades conspicuously below the sector median multiple. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 2.71%. Thus, from a relevancy and dividend standpoint, SNA represents one of the undervalued income stocks to buy in January.United Microelectronics (UMC)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockDue to the severe global supply chain disruption impacting the broader technology space, it’s no surprise that semiconductor firm United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) suffered steep losses in 2022. In the trailing year, UMC gave up nearly 27% of equity value. That said, modern societies always move forward. Therefore, UMC could make for an interesting pickup among undervalued income stocks to buy.Indeed, the rest of the markets seem to think so. Since the January opener, UMC stormed out of the gates to a nearly 21% upside performance. Currently, Wall Street analysts rate United as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target implies a 24% upside potential from here on out. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, UMC also enjoys very positive sentiment among hedge funds.As well, the market prices shares at 9.7-times forward earnings, well below the sector median of 18.6 times. Further, United benefits from a strong balance sheet and excellent profit margins. Its forward yield of 3.59% represents the icing on the cake. It’s easily one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockArguably, when most people look for ideas to invest in, manufacturers of power tools don’t come readily to mind. However, with the aforementioned Biden administration pushing its infrastructure-building initiatives, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) could enjoy upside success. Notably, analysts from Data Bridge Market Research project that the power tools market could reach a valuation of $51.45 billion. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2021.To be fair, the market hasn’t been friendly to SWK. In the trailing year, shares plunged more than 50%, which is horrendous, needless to say. However, investors appear to see incredible value in SWK now. Since the January opener, the underlying company gained over 16% of market value. To add more encouragement, hedge fund sentiment for the power tools specialist ranks as very positive.Right now, the market prices SWK at a trailing multiple of 9.7. This compares quite favorably against the sector median of 20.6 times. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 3.62%, making it one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAlthough I’m starting to go back to the well a bit too many times with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), if you’re seeking undervalued income stocks to buy, it’s probably one of the best for more aggressive investors. Fundamentally, what’s attractive about the company centers on its downstream component of the energy value chain. Focusing on refining and marketing, it’s directly connected to where the economic rubber meets the road.In my estimation, there will be plenty of rubber meeting the same congested road soon. With major enterprises now demanding their remote workers to come back to the office, oil firms must be licking their lips. While worker bees might put up a fuss, under a recessionary environment, it’s wise to just toe the line. Otherwise, you could be on the unemployment line.Objectively, PSX ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy based on its trailing multiple. Presently, the market prices shares at 4.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median pings at 8.4 times. With a forward yield of 3.63%, it’s very difficult to ignore Phillips 66.British American Tobacco (BTI)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockSaving the most controversial name on this list of undervalued income stocks to buy, agnostically-minded investors may want to consider British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI). Politically, socially and ideologically, the tobacco industry commands as much respect as a dental practice with no anesthesia. Still, British American is evolving with the market, particularly with its cleaner-profile vaping/e-cigarette products.Cynically, it’s also possible that the associated mental health pressures stemming from a recession may lead to an increased usage of adult liberties. I’m not just talking about “analog” cigarettes but also the increased use of vaping products. Based on the available evidence, vaping is less harmful than smoking but it’s not 100% safe.On the financial front, BTI makes a case for undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.72. In contrast, the sector median stands at 12.2 times. Finally, British American offers a forward yield of 7.76%.

Only the retired Shaun White has more X Games men’s snowboard halfpipe titles with eight.Nobody on Friday night attempted a triple cork, which was first done in competition by Japan’s Ayumu Hirano last season en route to the Olympic title. Hirano placed sixth Friday.“It was a tough night, pretty interesting conditions,” James said. “Had to adjust the game plan. The show goes on.”In a format introduced three years ago, athletes were ranked on overall impression over the course of a three-run jam session for the entire field rather than scoring individual runs.Earlier, Olympic gold medalist Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand repeated as women’s snowboard slopestyle champion, passing Olympic bronze medalist Tess Coady of Australia on the final run of the competition. Sadowski-Synnott, the only snowboarder or skier to win Olympic, world and X Games slopestyle titles, capped her finale with back-to-back 900s.The competition lacked 2014 and 2018 Olympic champion Jamie Anderson, who announced her pregnancy last month.Canada’s Megan Oldham landed the first triple cork in women’s ski big air competition history to beat Olympic silver medalist Tess Ledeux of France, according to commentators. Oldham, a 21-year-old ex-gymnast, was fourth at the Olympics.Eileen Gu, the Olympic champion from China, did not compete but is entered in halfpipe and slopestyle later this weekend.ON HER TURF: U.S. freeskier Maggie Voisin on grief, loss, finding motivationOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

What’s next? Who knows. I’ll still be skiing, I’ll still be around.”Goepper was part of a historic U.S. medals sweep in men’s ski slopestyle’s Olympic debut in 2014 in Russia. He went in as the favorite and ended up with bronze behind Joss Christensen and Gus Kenworthy. All three have now retired.A month before the 2018 Olympics, Goepper began revealing in interviews that he dealt with depression, a drinking problem and suicidal thoughts in 2014 and 2015.“He called one night, and he said, ‘Mom, I’m thinking about going to get a bottle of vodka and go sit in my car in Lambs Canyon [Utah] and drink the whole thing,’” his mom, Linda, said in a 2018 X Games interview. “Lambs Canyon was where another skier had committed suicide [2010 Olympic aerials silver medalist Jeret “Speedy” Peterson in 2011]. I knew that Nick was in trouble.”He spent two months in rehab in fall 2015.He returned to take Olympic silver in PyeongChang, jumping from eighth place after the second of three runs.After winning his men’s ski slopestyle record-breaking fourth and final X Games Aspen title in 2021, Goepper took another Olympic silver last year behind countryman Alex Hall.“[Winning three Olympic medals] is something I never dreamed of,” Goepper, who was 17 when the IOC added slopestyle to the Olympic program in 2011, said after last year’s medal. “If you asked me as a 16-year-old if this is what would be happening right now, I would tell you that you’re crazy.”Goepper, from the small farming town of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, sold candy bars and mowed lawns to pay for ski passes at a nearby resort (“a glorified bunny hill”), a determination that eventually led to major corporate sponsorships.Story continuesOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

Jared Golden (D-ME), crossed party lines to vote in favor.While the bill has little chance of being considered by the Senate and even less chance of reaching President Biden’s desk, the measure put the issue of SPR management at the top of Washington’s agenda for at least two days as the reserve sits at its lowest level since 1983.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) kicked off the debate Thursday, saying the bill was necessary to “ensure this vital American energy asset — and American security interests — will not be drained away for non-emergency, political purposes.”Under the bill, other than during an emergency situation, a president wouldn’t be able to tap the reserve unless it simultaneously released a plan to increase oil production in the U.S.Meanwhile, Democrats stood largely unified in opposition with Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) releasing a statement immediately after the vote, saying it was called at the behest of oil companies and it would “raise gas prices and impede the President’s ability to continue lowering costs at the pump for working families.“Private security contractors patrol the U.S. Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Bryan Mound, Texas May 20, 2008. (REUTERS/Donna W. Carson)'An effort to attack the president'Numerous amendments were considered from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) offered an idea to ban offshore drilling in her home state, but dismissed the overall process in an interview.“The whole conversation starts in this place that I think is rather cynical and just an effort to attack the president,"" she said. Still, she acknowledged there is some value in discussing the SPR overall, but suggested little would come of it.Story continues“I don't know that that's the most pressing conversation to have,” she said.The Biden administration made its first big withdrawal from the SPR in November 2021 of 50 million barrels in response to high gas prices. It followed up with over 180 million barrels over the course of 2022 in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Those were in addition to other scheduled regular withdrawals and cycling of the SPR.Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) has taken over the influential House House Energy and Commerce Commitee. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Supporters of the administration's strategy say the moves in 2022 were crucial to reducing gas prices by over $1.50 a gallon in recent months. The national average for gas prices sits at about $3.50 per gallon, with some observers expecting the price to rise in the coming months possibly to over $4 a gallon as demand picks up in the spring.Last month, the administration announced plans to begin replenishing the reserve, but rejected some initial offers because of pricing, with crude oil around $80/barrel.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters on Monday she is not worried about reaching the administration’s goal of buying 60 million barrels in the coming months, teasing an announcement that she promised “very soon.” Granholm added that Biden would veto the House GOP bill in the unlikely event it reaches his desk.This week’s vote follows a Jan. 12 vote around the SPR and China, which received wide bipartisan backing, a feat that was not repeated this week.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.United Therapeutics and Zoetis are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that UTHR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.UTHR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.10, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 31.35. We also note that UTHR has a PEG ratio of 1.56. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.84.Another notable valuation metric for UTHR is its P/B ratio of 2.64. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 16.82.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to UTHR's Value grade of B and ZTS's Value grade of D.UTHR stands above ZTS thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that UTHR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The newly published report, Liquidity pressures put funding in the crosshairs at community banks, is available on S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro, a trusted source for community banking data.Developed by the company's Financial Institutions Research team, the report utilizes S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's deep data on bank financials, M&amp;A and interest rate monitoring to produce insightful content that examines and forecasts trends for community banks. The S&amp;P Capital IQ Pro platform also offers community banks a wide variety of other solutions, including commercial prospecting tools, demographic data, mapping capabilities, branch-level data and news on the sector to help with market analysis, peer benchmarking, regulatory and board reporting, risk management and business development workflows.""Healthy loan growth, higher interest rates and modest increases in deposit costs have resulted in far stronger community bank margins in 2022. However, liquidity pressures have begun to emerge and will likely cause community banks to record notably higher funding costs in 2023 as institutions increase their reliance on more expensive wholesale funding and certificates of deposit (CDs),"" said Nathan Stovall, director of financial institutions research at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. ""Credit costs will also likely rise off historically low levels serving as a headwind to earnings but are expected to fall short of losses witnessed during a severe downturn.""Key highlights from the report include:CD balances and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB) are expected to steadily grow in 2023 as community banks seek to fulfill their liquidity needs, translating into notably higher deposit costs for the group. Earning-asset yields will also reprice higher but will fail to expand at the same rate as funding costs in 2023, causing margin expansion to stall for community banks.Community banks are projected to record a deposit beta, or the percentage change that banks pass on to all depositors, of 10% for the full year 2022, up from 6% through the first nine months of 2022. We expect the group to record a beta of 28% in 2023, leading to a cumulative beta of 22% by the end of 2023.Net charge-offs are expected to jump in 2023 off a historically low base to 0.19% of average loans.Provisions are expected to rise to 11.8% of net revenue in 2023, up from just 6.4% in 2022. From 2013 to 2019, community banks' provisions equated to 9.6% of net revenue on average.Story continuesTo request a copy of the Liquidity pressures put funding in the crosshairs at community banks, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.Scope and methodologyS&amp;P Global Market Intelligence analyzed nearly 10,000 banking subsidiaries, covering the core U.S. banking industry from 2004 through the third quarter of 2022. The analysis includes all commercial and savings banks and savings and loan associations, including historical institutions, as long as they were still considered current at the end of a given year. It excludes several hundred institutions that hold bank charters but do not principally engage in banking activities, among them industrial banks, nondepository trusts and cooperative banks.The outlook is based on management commentary, discussions with industry sources, regression analysis, and asset and liability repricing data disclosed in banks' quarterly call reports. While taking into consideration historical growth rates, the analysis often excludes the significant volatility experienced in the years around the credit crisis.The outlook is subject to change, perhaps materially, based on adjustments to the consensus expectations for interest rates, unemployment and economic growth.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: S&amp;P Global SPGI, MarketAxess MKTX, Penske Automotive Group PAG, Citizens Community Bancorp CZWI and Franklin Electric Co. FELE.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Watch on Dividend Hikes to Reward InvestorsThe bearish sentiment in U.S. stock markets prevails mostly due to multi-decade high inflation. Worried investors who have lost a massive amount of wealth since late 2021 continue to take refuge in safe investments that could preserve their capital and earn regular returns.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of December dropped to 6.5% after record highs in September and August 2022. Though the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting monetary policy began to yield results, its 2% inflation mark for a balanced economy seems a distant reality. The cenral bank will continue to increase the overnight interest rate, though the pace of rate hike in terms of percentage points could be lower, keeping in mind the recent developments.In its fight against inflation, the Fed raised the key interest rate seven times in 2022 and is expected to continue to do the same in 2023, thereby making it the highest in 15 years. Due to the high borrowing cost, which Americans are not comfortable with, it is expected that there will be slower growth and higher unemployment in recent times.Globally, geopolitical tensions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and Russia have created the worst energy crises in recent decades, causing a global supply-chain disturbance. Slowdown in growth and high inflation prevail in many countries due to high energy prices. Also, China has slowly started to recover from the last COVID resurgence. The country will take time to regain former efficiency. All these have disrupted the global supply-chain mechanism.Story continuesThus, investors seeking regular income in such an unstable situation may invest in matured businesses with a regular dividend payout. These stocks have shown profitability due to their proven business model, which helps them stay afloat during adverse economic conditions.Investors can expect a regular flow of income along with the preservation of capital against volatile market conditions. The company, which tends to reward its investors with a high dividend payout, comparatively outperforms non-dividend-paying stocks during market volatility.On that note, let us look at companies like S&amp;P Global, MarketAxess, Penske Automotive Group, Citizens Community Bancorp and Franklin Electric Co. that have lately hiked their dividend payments.S&amp;P Global is a NY-based company.

134,66787de6-0979-3826-b394-02aa4ad96617,MA,2023-01-28,Recession fears may be ‘overblown’ as consumer credit card debt grows: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/recession-fears-may-overblown-consumer-204900393.html,1674852540,VIDEO,"['AXP', 'V', 'MA']","[Bob Napoli, William Blair Co-Group Head of Financial Services and Technology, joins Yahoo Finance Live with his insights on what credit card companies' earnings may tell us about a possible recession.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: December survey revealing that Americans are carrying more credit card debt. 35% of US adults carry credit card debt from month-to-month. That's up from 29% in 2021. Now, consumer spending has remained strong despite fears of a recession. That is clearly evident in the Q4 earnings report that we just got from American Express.Amex cardholders are spending 24% more at restaurants than they were a year ago. Spend on lodging and airlines both seeing double-digit growth. Shares of Amex moving to the upside today-- big pop that we saw in shares, up nearly 11%. Joining us now is Bob Napoli, he's the William Blair Co-Group Head of Financial Services and Technology.Bob, it's great to see you here. So you have an outperform rating on American Express. We've gotten Visa and Mastercard also this week. You have an outperform rating on those as well. We've all been very concerned about a slowdown, about consumers pulling back. Are those fears clearly overblown because of these results?BOB NAPOLI: Well, again, the concerns are overblown because the consumer is under leveraged and they have jobs. And generally, when you have low consumer debt as a percentage of their income and they're employed, they're going to keep spending. So I think the fears of a bad recession are overblown.JARED BLIKRE: And just thinking about some of their key initiatives, especially with respect to their premium offerings, how does that affect the changes that have really happened to some of their user-- just to society overall, and travel habits, spending habits, saving habits that have changed over the last few years? How are their premium initiatives attacking that?BOB NAPOLI: Well, their premium initiatives-- they've added-- I guess they're targeting a higher percentage of younger-- 60% of new card members this year. They added a record amount of new card members, up more than 10% this year. 60% of those are millennials and Gen Zs.Story continuesAnd millennials and Gen Zs are really good at knowing how to use those rewards. And Amex has targeted things like Netflix, and gyms, and travel rewards to those younger consumers. Now, the rebound in travel certainly has been good for American Express as well.But they've developed those cards. I mean, those consumers are-- they're paying fees. I mean, American Express card isn't cheap. They pay a good annual fee. But they give you the rewards and high quality service that makes people willing to pay those fees.SEANA SMITH: Bob, when you take a look at these numbers from Amex, clearly, cardholders spending more on experiences-- spending was up 24%-- or they increased spending by 24% at restaurants than they did a year ago, clearly spending more on travel like you're saying. Do you see that spending pattern, those trends changing at all over the next couple of months as consumers maybe do brace for some sort of a slowdown?BOB NAPOLI: Well, you're going to see you're going to have tougher comps. So you're going to get more gradual increases in spending. I mean, the growing almost 30% revenue, that's not a sustainable level. I think double-digit revenue growth for Visa, Mastercard, for the payment space is sustainable.But you are going to see, as we lap those easier-- those tougher comps because of the rebound in COVID, you are seeing in the first quarter-- actually, you've seen really strong spending coming out of the gate in the month of January. Some of that is due to a year ago, we had Omicron.But spending continues to be strong. If we do get a bad recession, yeah, you'll see a pullback in consumer spending. I think where Amex is at the high end, you'll probably see less. But also, you still have more to go in international. I mean, China just reopened. Japan reopened in October.You saw a 50% increase in spending-- travel spending in Japan. China is the biggest travel market in the world. And you're going to see-- I mean that's going to be gradual over the course of this year where you'll see the rebound in China, which will carry over into Asia, which hasn't rebounded yet.So there's still more to go on the travel side. The consumer is employed. I mean, the Fed, I think a couple more rate increases and they're most likely done. So I think we're in a good place. The potential for a soft landing, I think, has increased.JARED BLIKRE: And I want to ask you-- a lot of companies talking about the strong dollar now. American Express has unique exposure to foreign currency. And I believe, at least historically, that has really benefited them whenever they have to change some of these money from dollars into euros, vice versa. How is that dynamic playing out with the currency-- with the volatility that we've seen in the dollar over the last year?BOB NAPOLI: Well, the volatility in currency-- actually, I think Visa and Mastercard probably benefit a little bit more of that. They have a higher percentage of international than Amex does. I mean the cross-border travel for Visa and Mastercard is a very, very profitable revenue stream.But the strength in the dollar is actually mixed, I would say, for those companies. But it certainly helps their earnings as you translate the foreign earnings into US dollars, they're worth more as the dollar weakens. But I do see some slowdown in some of the benefits on foreign exchange volatility for Visa, Mastercard. I see all three benefiting from the weaker dollar.SEANA SMITH: So, Bob, you have an outperform rating on all three. Clearly, you are bullish about what we could see over the next 12 months. If you had to pick one of those names, which one is positioned best?BOB NAPOLI: Well, the one that is the best stock to own and our top pick for this year is American Express. And the reason for that is that it's trading at a 50% discount to Visa, Mastercard. Visa, Mastercard are some of the best franchises in the world with the biggest-- with very large moats. But Amex is right there with them.And should it trade at a discount? Yes. A 50% discount is ridiculous. A discount to the S&amp;P 500 when Amex fundamentally has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over any period of time that you want to look at-- 5, 10, 15, 20 years-- you know, Amex is just not getting the respect it should. Sure, it's getting a little more today, but it's still only at 13 times next year's earnings. This stock should trade at 17 times an S&amp;P multiple, at least-- probably a premium to the S&amp;P.JARED BLIKRE: No respect-- a Rodney Dangerfield joke.BOB NAPOLI: Exactly.JARED BLIKRE: From back in the day, that's what came to mind there. Thank you. Great insights as always. Bob Napoli.]"

136,66cd7636-331a-4ef6-acde-c79c022286c5,MA,2023-01-28,Credit card giants see consumer spending 'remarkably resilient' amid recession fears,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-card-giants-see-consumer-spending-remarkably-resilient-amid-recession-fears-173202481.html,1674840722,STORY,"['AXP', 'V', 'MA']","[Quarterly results from credit card giants Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and American Express (AXP) out this week added further evidence consumers remain in good shape amid elevated inflation and swirling recession fears.""We aren't seeing recessionary signals,"" American Express CEO Stephen Squeri told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi on Friday.These comments echo similar notions set forth by Squeri's peers at Mastercard and Visa just a day before.""While macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty persists, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient,"" said Michael Miebach, Mastercard CEO, in the company's earnings statement on Thursday. ""We are well prepared to adjust our investment profile quickly if needed.""Visa CFO Vasan Prabhu told analysts on the company's call Thursday afternoon, ""business trends have been remarkably stable."" At the end of the firm's fiscal year — which wrapped up in September 2022 — Visa planned for no recession hitting its business in fiscal 2023. Right now, the company sees ""no evidence"" of a change in that trend.Shares of American Express were up about 10% on Friday following its quarterly results, while Visa stock gained about 2%. Mastercard, which reported results before the open on Thursday, saw shares little-changed.Results from these companies come as fears over an impending recession in the U.S. abroad continue to dominate the conversation for investors.The latest reading on GDP growth out Thursday showed the U.S. economy finished 2022 in a stronger-than-expected position.Retail sales data for December out earlier this month, however, suggested some moderation to cap last year.In a note to clients, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev said both Mastercard and Visa provided volume data that showed slowing consumer purchases between November and December. However, unlike Mastercard, Visa added purchasing volume from January.“Healthy U.S. January trends should offer a sigh of relief amid broader slowdown concern,” Dolev wrote.Story continuesStill, the divide between corporate readouts on real-time activity and economists modeling higher interest rates and a loss of growth momentum are clear across markets.NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 27: People wait in long lines to enter the Harry Potter store in Flatiron on December 27, 2022 in New York City. According to a report by Mastercard, holiday sales rose to 7.6 % which is higher than was expected by lower than previous years. (Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images)In a note to clients on Friday, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote: ""Calling a recession in real time is never a simple task. The data rarely all point in one direction at the same time. We start with the simple question: are there reasons to expect a recession? In this case, the answer is a resounding yes.""In Ashworth's view, last year's rise in interest rates and the firm's tracking of forward-looking economic behavior suggests the odds of recession starting within 6 months are 98%.""If the model is wrong, that would turn out to be one hell of a false positive,"" Ashworth wrote. ""That's why we are sticking with our forecast that the US economy will experience a mild recession beginning soon.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

V reported fiscal first-quarter 2023 earnings of $2.18 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 by 8.5% and our estimate of $1.97. The bottom line improved 21% year over year.Net revenues amounted to $7.9 billion, which advanced 12% year over year in the quarter under review. The top line outpaced the consensus mark by 3.4% and our estimate of $7.6 billion.The solid quarterly results benefited on the back of steady domestic volumes and transactions coupled with a continued rebounding of cross-border travel. Growing net flows and value-added services also contributed to the upside. Other additional tailwinds to its quarterly results included those of high currency volatility and lower-than-expected client incentives.Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVisa Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Visa Inc. Quote Operational PerformanceVisa’s payments volume grew 7% year over year on a constant-dollar basis in the December quarter. Processed transactions (implying transactions processed by Visa) totaled 52.5 billion, which rose 10% year over year but lagged our estimate of 52.8 billion.On a constant-dollar basis, the cross-border volume of Visa climbed 22% year over year in the quarter under review. Excluding transactions within Europe, its cross-border volume (that boosts a company’s international transaction revenues) advanced 31% year over year on a constant-dollar basis.Service revenues improved 10% year over year to $3.5 billion during the December quarter on the back of better payment volume. The metric came higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $3.4 billion.V’s data processing revenues of $3.8 billion grew 6% year over year in the quarter under review, missing the consensus mark of $4 billion and our estimate of $3.9 billion.International transaction revenues advanced 29% year over year to $2.8 billion, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate of $2.6 billion. Other revenues of $587 million climbed 31% year over year, which came higher than the consensus mark of $511 million and our estimate of $522.7 million.Story continuesClient incentives (a contra-revenue item) of Visa escalated 18% year over year to $2.8 billion in the quarter under review. The metric amounted for 26% of Visa’s gross revenues of $10.7 billion.Operating expenses of $2.8 billion increased 25% year over year, higher than our estimate of $2.5 billion. The increase was due to elevated personnel costs and litigation provisions. Non-GAAP operating expenses escalated 15% year over year. Interest expense came in at $137 million, up 2.2% year over year.Balance Sheet (as of Dec 31, 2022)Visa exited the December quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $13.3 billion, which dropped 15% from fiscal year-end Sep 30, 2022.Total assets of $85.4 billion dipped 0.1% from the 2022 fiscal year-end.V’s long-term debt amounted to $20.5 billion, which inched up 1.4% from fiscal year-end Sep 30, 2022.Total equity grew 3.8% from the 2022 fiscal year-end to $36.9 billion.Cash FlowsVisa generated net cash from operations of $4.2 billion in the December quarter, which declined 1.4% year over year.

Client incentives are expected to remain at the upper side of the 26.5%-27.5% of gross revenues band. The strength in domestic payments volume and processed transactions are expected to stay in the fiscal second-quarter 2023. While the discontinuation of Russian operations might spare processed transactions growth, it is likely to have an adverse impact on payment volume growth rates in the upcoming quarter.Non-GAAP non-operating expenses are projected to lie within $40-$50 million in the second quarter.Operating Expense Outlook Through Fiscal 2023Non-GAAP operating expense is likely to witness a declining trend throughout fiscal 2023. From the expense growth recorded in the fiscal first-quarter 2023, the growth of expense on a nominal dollar basis is anticipated to decline two or three points in the fiscal second-quarter 2023. The non-GAAP operating expense growth rate in the third quarter is likely to face a further reduction of two to three points, while the same in the fourth quarter might witness another two to three-point decline.Zacks RankVisa currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A total of 11.34 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 10.93 billion.GDP Data Boosts Investors’ SentimentWall Street opened lower on Thursday but reversed soon following an onslaught of economic data that included the advance estimate report on the fourth-quarter gross domestic product, which came in higher than the consensus estimate. The U.S. economy grew 2.9% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter, higher than economists’ expectations of a rise of 2.8%, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Although the GDP growth in the fourth quarter slowed slightly, the economy has now expanded more than the normal rate for the second consecutive quarter. U.S. GDP grew 3.2% in the third quarter, following two straight quarters of declines.The impressive data gave the much-required boost to investors’ confidence and raised hopes of a softer landing in 2023 instead of the economy slipping into recession.Story continuesInvestors are also hopeful about the Fed going slow on its pace of interest rate hikes on signs that inflation is easing as they wait for the central bank’s policy meeting scheduled in February. The impressive GDP reading helped sent stocks on a rally with the S&amp;P ending at the highest level since December.Earnings Season Gains PaceIt has been a mixed earnings season so far and investors have been closely watching quarterly reports from big companies to gauge the economy’s health. On Thursday, investors digested another batch of mixed earnings reports.Corporate earnings released after the closing bell on Wednesday and before the bell on Thursday helped boost investors’ confidence after Microsoft Corporation MSFT issued lackluster guidance earlier this week.On Thursday, shares of Tesla, Inc.

(NYSE:CCI) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript January 26, 2023Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Crown Castle Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ben Lowe, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.Ben Lowe: Thank you, Kate and good morning everyone.

Tables reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures are available in the supplemental information package in the Investors section of the company's website at crowncastle.com. So with that, let me turn the call over to Jay.Jay Brown: Thanks, Ben and thank you everyone for joining us on the call this morning. As you saw from our results, 2022 was another successful year for Crown Castle and the positive trends across our business remain intact. With fourth quarter 2022 results coming in as we expected and no changes to our 2023 outlook, I plan to keep my prepared remarks brief before handing it over to Dan to talk through the numbers in a bit more detail. As I reflect on 2022, I am proud of what our team accomplished. We led the industry again with nearly 6.5% organic tower revenue growth as our customers upgraded existing tower sites with additional spectrum and added equipment to thousands of tower sites they were not previously on to support nationwide deployment of 5G.Story continuesAnd we deployed 5,000 small cells to support initial network densification efforts while growing our fiber solutions revenue by 2%. The positive operating trends in 2022 exceeded our initial expectations for the year and offset the impact of the rapid increase in interest rates, demonstrating the resilience of our business model and strategy. As a result, we were able to deliver strong bottom line growth that supported more than 9% dividend per share growth. As we discussed when we initially provided guidance in October, we believe that a positive operating momentum will carry into 2023, driving another year of expected strong growth with 5% organic growth in towers and a doubling of our small cell deployments to 10,000 nodes. With respect to tower leasing trends, the established national wireless operators are deploying mid-band spectrum in earnest as a part of the initial phase of their 5G build-out.To-date, only about half of our sites across our top three customers have been upgraded with mid-band spectrum, providing a significant opportunity for additional revenue growth as additional sites are upgraded over time before their focus will likely shift to more infill with new co-locations. Adding to the substantial long-term growth opportunity, we continue to support DISH with their nationwide build-out of a new wireless network. And I believe we are in a great position to continue to capture an outsized share of that opportunity. Turning to small cells, we expect to double the rate of small cell deployments this year to 10,000 nodes with over half co-located on existing fiber to meet the growing demand from our customers as 5G networks will require small cells at scale.With approximately 60,000 nodes on air and another 60,000 contracted in our backlog, I believe 2023 will represent the first year in a sustained acceleration of growth for our small cell business. We also continue to see opportunities to add to the returns we are generating from small cells by leveraging the same shared fiber assets to pursue profitable fiber solutions growth and we expect to return to 3% growth as we exit 2023. Looking at the bigger picture beyond this year and why I am so excited about our growth opportunity, we are still in the early innings with 5G as the industry is only a couple of years into what we expect will be a decade-long growth opportunity. Our customers are seeing significantly higher levels of monthly data consumption as consumers upgrade to 5G, providing the need for significant network investment for years to come to keep pace with this persistent growth in mobile data demand.As we have seen in our industry throughout its history, generational upgrades to the wireless network occur in phases with an initial push to provide nationwide coverage followed by periods of continued network augmentation and densification that has led to long periods of sustained growth. We believe we are in the initial phase of the 5G build-out with many phases to follow over the coming years. Consistent with their past practice, we believe our customers will first deploy their spectrum on the majority of their existing sites as they are currently doing before shifting their focus to cell site densification to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing it over shorter and shorter distances. The nature of wireless networks requires that cell site densification will continue as the density of data demand grows and we expect 5G densification to require both towers and small cells at scale to fill in the network.Real estate, Investment, HousePhoto by Tierra Mallorca on UnsplashWith that view in mind, we have invested more than $40 billion of capital to-date in towers and more recently, small cells and fiber that are mission-critical for wireless networks to capture as much of this growth opportunity as possible. Importantly, we are already generating a 10% return on our total invested capital with the opportunity to increase that return over time as we add customers to our tower and fiber assets and grow our cash flow. As a result, I believe Crown Castle is an excellent investment that will generate compelling returns by providing investors with access to the most exposure to the development of next-generation networks in the U.S. with our comprehensive offering of towers, small cells and fiber, providing the opportunity to benefit from the best growth and lowest risk market, an attractive total return profile with a current yield of 4% and a long-term annual dividend per share growth target of 7% to 8% and the development of attractive new assets that we believe will extend our runway of growth and create shareholder value.And with that, I will turn the call over to Dan.Dan Schlanger: Thanks, Jay and good morning everyone. We generated another year of solid growth in 2022 and we expect the strong operating trends across our business to continue as we see a long runway of 5G investment in the U.S. The elevated leasing activity across our customers contributed to another year of industry leading tower revenue growth in 2022 of nearly 6.5% and to 9% growth in our annual dividends per share. Before discussing the 2022 results and 2023 outlook, I want to draw your attention to some enhancements we made this quarter to the disclosure in our supplemental information package. In response to feedback we have heard from our investors, we provided organic billings growth detail by line of business for towers, small cells and fiber solutions to help investors better understand the composition of organic growth trends.This enhanced disclosure includes historical organic growth information going back to 2019. In addition to expanding our disclosure, we also reorganized the supplemental information package, in many cases, by line of business to make it easier for readers to follow. We hope you find this additional information and the new layout to be helpful. Now turning to the full year 2022 financial results on Slide 4 of our earnings presentation, site rental revenues increased 10%, adjusted EBITDA growth was 14% and AFFO increased by 6% for the year. The 10% growth in site rental revenues included 5% growth in organic contribution to site rental billings, consisting of nearly 6.5% growth from towers, more than 5% growth in small cells and 2% growth in fiber solutions.Turning to Page 5, our full year 2023 outlook remains unchanged and includes site rental revenue growth of 4%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% and AFFO growth of 4%. We also expect organic billings growth of approximately 4% when adjusted for the impact of the previously disclosed Sprint cancellations. The 4% consolidated organic growth consists of 5% growth in towers, 8% growth in small cells and flat revenue in fiber solutions. As we discussed last quarter, we expect the rationalization of a portion of Sprint's legacy network to result in some movements in our financial results that are not typical for our business. Our expectations for non-renewals and accelerated payments associated with this network rationalization activity are unchanged with approximately $30 million of new non-renewals and $160 million to $170 million of accelerated payments during 2023.We expect the majority of the non-renewals to occur in the first quarter and therefore impact year-over-year billings growth in each quarter this year. We expect the accelerated payments associated with this decommissioning activity and related services work to be concentrated in the second quarter. As a result, we expect the second quarter to represent the high watermark for adjusted EBITDA and AFFO in 2023. Turning to financing activities, we finished 2022 with leverage in line with our target of approximately 5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. For full year 2023, our discretionary CapEx outlook is also unchanged with gross CapEx of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion or approximately $1 billion net of expected prepaid rent. Based on our current backlog of small cells that includes a significant mix of co-location nodes, which have higher returns and require less capital relative to anchor builds, we expect to be able to finance our discretionary capital with debt while we are maintaining our investment grade credit profile.Earlier this month, we added to our strong balance sheet position when we issued $1 billion in senior unsecured notes with a 5% coupon to term out borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Following this financing transaction, we have more than 85% fixed rate debt, a weighted average maturity of over 8 years, limited maturities through 2024 and approximately $5.5 billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facility. So to wrap up, we are excited about the strength of our business and our ability to execute on our strategy to deliver the highest risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by growing our dividend over the long-term and investing in assets that will help drive future growth. We have delivered 9% compound annual and dividend per share growth since we established our 7% to 8% dividend per share growth target in 2017.And I believe that we are positioned well to return to 7% to 8% dividend per share growth as we move beyond the Sprint decommissioning impacts in 2025. With that, Kate, I'd like to open the call to questions.See also 11 Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks To Buy and 12 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $10.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE:MRK) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 10th of April to $0.73. The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.8%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Merck Merck's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Based on the last payment, Merck was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 39.9% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 36% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendMerck Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.68 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.92. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.7% over that duration. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Merck has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 42% per annum. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.We Really Like Merck's DividendOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Agrochemical Companies in the World. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is about to enter a full twelve months upended global agriculture supply chains. Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's top agricultural and food products exporters, and a conflict between them cast doubt on the integrity of the global supply chain. As an illustration of the importance of both countries in the global food supply chain, data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that as of August 2022, Russia and Ukraine were responsible for producing 13% of the world's wheat - with the lion's share of 10% going to Russia. This made Russia the world's largest wheat exporter and Ukraine the fifth largest.Similarly, data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that apart from wheat, Ukraine was the world's largest sunflower producer, the second largest producer of sunflower oil and sunflower meal, and the fourth largest producer of barley. Why is this important? Well, the Ukraine invasion has led to supply diversification across a host of sectors, such as energy, and including agriculture. This has had an effect on the stock market as well. For instance, shares of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

160,5a516493-a112-357b-a72b-89413610e452,MOS,2023-01-28,Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) Is Increasing Its Dividend To $0.20,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mosaic-nyse-mos-increasing-dividend-160758384.html,1674835678,STORY,['MOS'],"[The board of The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.20 on the 16th of March, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.6%. Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic Mosaic's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. However, Mosaic's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to fall by 54.0% over the next year. If the dividend continues along the path it has been on recently, we estimate the payout ratio could be 9.0%, which is comfortable for the company to continue in the future.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.50 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 4.8% over that duration. It's encouraging to see some dividend growth, but the dividend has been cut at least once, and the size of the cut would eliminate most of the growth anyway, which makes this less attractive as an income investment.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowWith a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Mosaic has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 63% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.We Really Like Mosaic's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Mosaic is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The earnings easily cover the company's distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 2 warning signs for Mosaic you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit unpleasant. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.Blake Moret: Thanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. I'm pleased with our team's exceptional focus and execution as we delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability. Organic sales and earnings were both up year-over-year and better than we expected this quarter. Rockwell's continued investments in resiliency and agility, along with a gradually improving supply chain environment, helped more than offset many of the headwinds we faced heading into Q1. Orders and backlog were up sequentially in the quarter. Order cancellation rates were flat to prior quarter and remain in the low single digits through January. We are encouraged by the continued strength of our end user demand across all business segments and regions.Story continuesTotal sales grew almost 7% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 10% year-over-year, better than our expectations despite a very dynamic supply chain environment. Currency translation reduced sales by 4% and acquisitions contributed about a point of growth this quarter. Consistent with our prior assumptions, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry was impacted by access to specific electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased about 7% versus prior year with growth in all regions and product lines. We had another quarter of remarkable order growth in our independent cart technology business, driven by large multi-year deals across many industries including EV, material handling and semiconductor.I'll cover some of these strategic wins in a few minutes. Software and Control organic sales grew almost 16% versus prior year. Better than expected growth was driven by our team's ability to quickly redesign and requalify certain Logix products to secure additional components supply with the support from key suppliers. We also continue to see a gradual improvement in electronic component supply. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 10% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was a healthy 1.21 and was consistent across solutions, services and Sensia businesses. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales had another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We are seeing a significant uptick here in large multisite and multiyear deals, both in software and services.One of our Information Solutions wins this quarter was with a leading potato processing company, where a combination of our Kalypso digital consulting and enterprise analytics capabilities helped the customer increase throughput and reduce energy costs across multiple production lines. We're proud to be an important digital partner to this global company as they focus on doubling their revenue over the next five years. Our recent software acquisitions continue to land us new logos across various industries and regions. These include Plex wins in metals, food and beverage and automotive and numerous enterprise asset management wins Fiix's cloud-native offering in Asia, where we are leveraging the distribution network to amplify our sales with local customers.On the Connected Services side, we continue to build momentum with enterprise cybersecurity wins with customers across food and beverage, life sciences and consumer packaged goods, prioritizing their investments and resiliency of their operations. One of our key cyber wins this quarter was with one of the world's largest global consumer goods companies, who chose Rockwell's differentiated portfolio of hardware, software and services along with the capabilities of our partner Claroty to manage OT security at hundreds of their sites globally. This multiyear deal will also contribute to our double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue. Q1 ARR grew 14%. Segment margin of 20% was up over 100 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected.Adjusted EPS grew 15% year-over-year. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 end market performance. All three industry segments saw strong year-over-year growth and were above expectations, consistent with the continued gradual improvement in electronic component availability. In our discrete industries, sales were up low teens. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We continue to win new and follow-on orders with both the brand owners and the supporting EV ecosystem, including vehicle and battery OEMs and system integrators. A good example of Rockwell's strong position in EV this quarter is our win with a leading battery supplier. Our independent cart technology was selected for the battery cell assembly and formation process to support Ford's BlueOval greenfield plants in Kentucky and Tennessee.We talked about our strategic partnership with Ford at our Investor Day last November, and we are excited about the progress we are making together. Semiconductor sales grew over 20% versus prior year. This is another vertical where we are able to expand our offerings to new applications, including independent cart for wafer transport and Logix-based automation for silicon carbide wafer manufacturing. In eCommerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down low teens versus prior year. Some of our largest eCommerce customers are in the process of shifting their investment from greenfield to brownfield, and we expect continued investments in upgrading existing facilities, including next-gen sortation systems over the course of this fiscal year.One of our large multiyear wins in eCommerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell's smart machine architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale. Another important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic's disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications. Moving to our Hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year.As I mentioned earlier, we saw a number of large cybersecurity wins in this vertical, underscoring customers' focus on resiliency and security in their operations. Life Sciences sales grew mid-single digits in the quarter. In addition to software, we saw a high number of cybersecurity wins in this end market this quarter with several important wins coming from Europe. Tire was also up mid-single digits in the quarter. Let's turn to Process. This segment grew mid-single digits versus prior year, led by growth in metals and oil and gas. We rarely talk about our metals vertical, but we had an important sustainability win with Cornish Lithium, a pioneering mineral exploration and development company, who chose Rockwell's PlantPAx process control system for its demo plant to convert lithium concentrate into high-grade refined lithium used for battery production.15 fastest growing industries in the worldChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comWe are excited to partner with Cornish Lithium on this energy transition journey. Turning now to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. Similar to last fiscal year, our performance here is a reflection of electronic component availability rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 8% year-over-year, Latin America sales were up 6%, EMEA sales increased by over 13% and Asia Pacific was up 16%. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. Given our Q1 performance, our record backlog and a gradually improving supply chain we are increasing our top line and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2023. While we are encouraged by the improving electronic component landscape, the macroeconomic environment is still very dynamic and we continue to take a conservative approach in our operations.Our fiscal 2023 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 12%. Organic sales growth of 13% at the midpoint assumes continued supply chain improvement. The majority of our fiscal 2023 shipments are already in backlog. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2 points. Nick will touch more on this later. ARR is still expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 17% versus prior year and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Nick?Nick Gangestad: Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 6.7% over last year, Q1 organic sales were up 9.9% and acquisitions contributed 80 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4 points. About 7 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 20.2% and was significantly higher than our expectations. The majority of our margin improvement versus our expectations was driven by the higher revenue from the redesign activity and improved electronic component availability that Blake discussed earlier. The 110 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend.Corporate and other expense was $27 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.46 was ahead of our expectations and grew 15% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on the later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.1%. This was in line with our expectations and aligned with our full year estimate of an 18% adjusted effective tax rate. Free cash flow of $42 million was $91 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pre-tax income. As in recent quarters, working capital continued to grow sequentially. We expect one more quarter of working capital increases this year. We expect working capital balances to decline slightly in the second half of the year as our supply chain gradually improves.One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $156 million. On December 31st, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits in Software and Control and Lifecycle Services, with Intelligent Devices growing 7% year-over-year. As Blake mentioned earlier, orders grew sequentially in Q1 as we saw a healthy demand driven by continued strong project activity with our customers. We continue to see customer ordering patterns consistent with the longer lead times we have for portions of our portfolio. We expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and different products improve.Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin declined by 130 basis points year-over-year due to higher resiliency spend and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by positive impact from higher price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 630 basis points compared to last year on positive price cost, the favorable year-over-year impact of Plex and higher sales. Lifecycle Services margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Similar to Q2 fiscal year 2022, we expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand through the balance of the year. The next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2022 to Q1 fiscal 2023. Core performance was up $0.55 on a 9.9% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in earnings per share.This was slightly better than our expectations. The year-over-year impact was due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Incentive compensation was a $0.10 headwind, slightly more than our original plan and driven by our increased growth and earnings expectations for the year. Our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05. Let's move on to the next Slide, 11, guidance for fiscal 2023. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to about $8.7 billion in fiscal 2023 or 12% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 11% to 15% or 13% at the midpoint of our range. We expect volume to be 9 points of growth and price to be 4 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our Q1 outperformance and is based on our current view of electronic component availability and the rate at which we can deliver on our backlog.By quarter, we expect organic growth rates in Q2 and Q3 to be the highest of the year with each up in the mid to high teens year-over-year, while Q4 revenue is expected to grow organically single digits. While we expect sales to be up sequentially in Q2, we expect margins to be similar to Q1 levels due to higher sequential spend on new product development, resiliency and the timing of our annual merit increase. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 200 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21%, up from prior guidance of about 20.5%. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year, with most of the favorability coming from the price actions we took in fiscal 2022.As expected, the majority of our year-over-year price/cost benefit this year is coming in the first half of the year. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of around 35%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 18%. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $10.70 to $11.50. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 17% adjusted EPS growth, up from the prior guidance of approximately 12% at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal 2023 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal 2023 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2023 is now expected to be about $130 million.We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.4 million shares. We've also included on Slide 12 an adjusted EPS walk from our previous guidance to our current guidance at the midpoint for your reference. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&amp;A. Blake?Blake Moret: Thanks Nick. In this dynamic environment, we are positioning ourselves and our customers for a more resilient, agile and sustainable future. Automation has never been more important in solving our customers' biggest challenges. A large percentage of these global investments are being made in the U.S., where we have the strongest market share, the best channel and decades-long relationships. Shoring is real for many of our most important verticals, and we see these investments, along with the early benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, reflected in our continued, strong order rates. We are accelerating the pace of our innovation, including new product introductions across all key product platforms and our recent acquisitions.These were showcased at our very successful automation fair in Chicago, where we welcomed over 18,000 customers, partners and employees to an amazing demonstration of the value provided by Rockwell and our friends. I was also able to meet our new CUBIC team in Denmark a few weeks ago, and I am excited about the new opportunities to expand our sustainability portfolio with an increased presence in renewables, CUBIC's largest customer segment. Importantly, I'm happy with how our culture is both embraced and enriched by our recent additions. And I'm excited to see how we deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come. Aijana will now begin the Q&amp;A Session.Aijana Zellner: Thanks, Blake. Thank you.

S&amp;P up just about a quarter of a percent. The NASDAQ up about 1% with tech outperforming for the majority of the week.Let's take a look at some of the day's top movers. Hasbro-- let's talk about that stock-- is tumbling today as the company reported prelim fourth-quarter results. We're looking at losses of just about 8%. Now the toymaker expecting fourth-quarter revenue, which includes that very important holiday season for this business, to fall 17% from the year prior.Now, Hasbro also signaling that the tech industry is not the only sector start far from to rebalance its workforce. The 100-year-old toy company planning to cut 15% of its global workforce. Hasbro hoping cutting those positions, a thousand positions, could save it up to $300 million annually by 2025.And, Jared, in those cuts, the president and COO is going to be leaving as well. They clearly needed to adjust their business to cut some costs. Wall Street seems to be a little bit mixed in terms of what we could expect from Hasbro over the next couple of months. Jefferies is saying it's going to be a painful period, but they're more confident that Hasbro is going to come out with higher margins, that you will be rewarded if you stick with it.On the flip, side Truist a little bit more of a negative view. They're not too optimistic that that growth is going to continue.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with some of these companies in the retail space because the layoffs, they hit the tech space first, some of those fringe jobs. Then they hit the manufacturing space, the industrials, and then the retail takes a hit. So we'll have to see if that happens.Story continuesJust taking a look at the YFi Interactive here, I was looking at a retail screen-- we've got that up-- over the last five days. Lots of green right there, but you contrast it with the industrials. I was taking a look at them as well. Boeing doing really well, but I think it's kind of-- or excuse me, Boeing has done very well this year, but I think they're kind of an outlier giving their checkered history and their bounce back from the 737 Max disaster.DAVE BRIGGS: The news, of course, about Boeing that they, unlike Hasbro, complete opposite reaction to the economy. They are adding 10,000 workers this year. So you ask yourself, what is happening overall with the workforce in this country?Outside of tech, we haven't seen a whole lot of layoffs. That's why Hasbro raised so many eyebrows. You had 3M as well cutting 2,500. So it looked like the trend was starting to pick up, and then Boeing comes out with this massive number.They're not alone. United will hire 2,500 pilots this year. Southwest, as much struggles as they've had, they will hire this year. We just learned that Chipotle-- burrito season, which is March to May. I did not know there was a burrito season.SEANA SMITH: Me neither, and I'm excited about it.DAVE BRIGGS: They are hiring 15,000 workers. So it will be interesting as we push forward towards another jobs number next week. What are we going to see? Doesn't look like a big tick down on the unemployment rate. These layoffs have been relatively small, for the most part. In particular, Boeing's hires outweigh just about all the layoffs we've seen over the last week.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And it will also be interesting to see whether or not some of these companies who are hiring, whether or not they'll be able to find the workers that they need or the workers that they are hoping to get, given the labor shortage.All right, elsewhere in retail, let's talk about Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because news coming out of the potential bankruptcy filing here. The stock closing up just about 1% today. Bloomberg reporting that the retailer has been unable to find a bankruptcy buyer and could be facing liquidation. Our own Brian Sozzi also reporting this afternoon that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is closing all of its Harmon brand stores.We're looking at gains today. Dave, it almost seems like the safest way to put this, bankruptcy seems imminent. It's all just a question of time at this point and what exactly it's going to look like.Without question. I think my biggest questions are more, what are they going to do with the assets? What are they going to do with the real estate? That is a massive amount of real estate across this country.I thought interesting side note. If, in fact, they do file, who will benefit from their exit? Well, the note from Oppenheimer today says Target stands in line to benefit the most from the exit. So they got a little pop from that, and I think Target could also benefit, quite frankly, if Party City has to file as well. See a little bit of their business.Jared, it looks inevitable. More a question of when, not if.JARED BLIKRE: I think so, and something surprised me. I was just looking at the YFi Interactive at our retail heat map once again. I was just showing this. I sorted by performance because Bed Bath &amp; Beyond too small to be seen. Guess what? It's positive on the year, one point-- up 1.6%, and that's after the nasty drubbing that it's taken over the last few days. Basically a penny stock, so not much more to comment on there.If they have to liquidate, it's going to be a situation that we haven't seen like-- we were talking about some analogs in the global financial crisis. I think Circuit City was a name, and there are some others there. So we'll see.]"

Boeing employs about 136,000 workers in the United States.Boeing acknowledged it will ""lower staffing within some support functions"" - a move meant to enable it to better align resources to support current products and technology development. It declined to comment on how many jobs it will cut in 2023.Most of the growth will occur in Boeing's business units, as well as engineering and manufacturing, to meet airlines' growing demand.The company plans to increase deliveries of the 737 MAX from 374 aircraft in 2022 to between 400 to 450 planes this year, with deliveries of the 787 expected to hit between 70 and 80 aircraft.European rival Airbus said this week it plans to add 13,000 employees this year. About 7,000 of those jobs are set to be newly created positions, with about 9,000 of the new hires based in Europe.Boeing did not comment on how many net new jobs would created in the United States in 2023.The U.S. planemaker is nearing pre-pandemic workforce levels, which stood at 161,000 people at the end of 2019. During 2020, the workforce fell to about 141,000 employees after Boeing announced job reductions.""Hiring is not a constraint anymore,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts Wednesday.

On today's call are Kathy Warden, our Chair, CEO and President; and Dave Keffer, our CFO. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kathy. Kathy?Kathy Warden: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Northrop Grumman team delivered another year of strong performance in 2022, positioning our company for the coming year and beyond. A growing global demand environment and the team's success in capitalizing on competitive opportunities drove exceptional bookings. Top line growth accelerated throughout the year, driven in part by improving labor trends. I'll note that we set our sales and EPS guidance ranges at the beginning of 2022, and even in a dynamic macro environment, we navigated the challenges to deliver at or above the high end of those ranges, and then importantly, to deliver capability for our customers. This performance highlights our solid operating execution, our ability to win new business and the alignment of Northrop Grumman's portfolio to our customers' priorities.Story continuesWe enter 2023 with a backlog of more than 2x our annual sales. This strong backlog, along with increasing demand and rising global defense budget supports our expectations for continued growth. Given this and supported by robust headcount growth, we have increased our 2023 sales guidance range from our October outlook. We are projecting solid segment margin performance that takes into consideration inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, consistent with the expectations we outlined on the October call. And we expect a greater than 20% compound annual growth in our multiyear cash flow outlook that supports continued investments in the business and significant returns of capital to shareholders. Before providing more details on our outlook, I'm going to highlight a few notable achievements from the previous year that underscore the tenets of our long-term strategy and illustrate our positioning for the future.In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope proved its status as the world's most powerful space telescope and an engineering marvel. It achieved full operational status, shared first images in July and continues to discover and inspire with its incredible insights into distinct galaxies. This project is just one example of the technology innovation and leadership our team brings to our customers. And it has provided an excellent platform for attracting talent to our industry and our company. In 2022, we continued to win new competitive awards across the company, achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Two notable new awards are the space development agencies tracking and transport layers. As our customers look to expand their resilient national security space capabilities, these programs leverage our advanced space solutions for low earth orbit and showcase our ability to compete and win programs across a range of missions.We also completed over 40 successful launch and space missions in the year, exemplifying our end-to-end capabilities in the space market and our ability to perform at scale. Further, our solid rocket boosters helped propel NASA's base launch system as part of the Artemis 1 mission with the largest human-rated solid rocket boosters ever built. We also received a $2 billion award for GEM 63 solid rocket boosters in support of Amazon's Project Kuiper. Together, SLS and Kuiper validate the robust investments that we've made in solid rocket motor capabilities. We also delivered advanced architectures that integrate sensors to provide unprecedented situational awareness for our customers. One example is our IBCS solution. After successful testing in the fourth quarter, IBCS is poised to transition from LRIP to full-rate production in 2023.IBCS integrate systems that weren't designed to work together, creating a seamless air and missile defense network and allowing customers to better utilize their defense assets. This capability is needed more than ever to address advanced threats and it's one where we've seen a significant increase in interest across our global customer base with 10 additional countries expressing interest in obtaining this system. We continue to keep our focus on innovating and leveraging our strong position in advanced technology. This includes the development of a new radar for the F-35. This radar is capable of defeating current and projected adversarial air and surface threats and is compatible with variants of the F-35 aircraft. And we capped off a strong year with the historic unveiling of the B-21 Raider.The B-21 is a multifunctional platform with unmatched range, stealth and survivability, and it will be the backbone of future U.S. air power for decades to come. We continue to perform well on the program and remain on track for first flight later this year. As the program transitions into low rate initial production, we are working to address macroeconomic conditions, especially related to inflation and their impact on material, suppliers and labor. Importantly, I want to highlight that our B-21 unit cost projections remain below the government's independent cost estimates. The program has strong support from the U.S. Air Force, Congress and our suppliers. And in the words of Secretary Austin from last month's rollout, ""This aircraft is proof of the department's commitment to building advanced capabilities that will fortify America's ability to deter aggression today, and in the future."" Our 2022 achievements underscore the breadth of our portfolio across a wide range of domains and technologies and the strong performance of the entire Northrop Grumman team.Mark Agnor/Shutterstock.comAs we look forward, defense budgets are on the rise, and we see our global customers continuing to seek proven solutions to address rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated threats. We are meeting their urgent needs in areas such as air and missile defense solutions, medium and large caliber ammunitions and armaments, advanced radar capabilities and global surveillance to name just a few. And we are partnering to expand our opportunity set and positioning our international business for future growth. We clearly saw increased demand in 2022, and we continue to expect to grow our international business over the next several years. In the U.S., we are encouraged by the continued strong support for National Security, including overwhelming bipartisan support for a 10% spending increase in the fiscal year 2023 defense budget that was passed in December.Our portfolio and the capabilities we offer are well supported by the administration and Congress. Growing security challenges will test our resolve in ways not seen for a generation, and we are confident this administration and the new Congress will find ways to work together to meet them. We expect the President's fiscal year 2024 budget request to support robust funding for the highest priority capabilities outlined in the National Defense Strategy. And our strategy has positioned us well. We're clearly maintaining our technology leadership and growing our portfolio of offerings, which is aligned to customer priorities. Another key element of our long-term strategy is keeping a laser focus on performance and driving cost efficiencies throughout the business.The current macroeconomic environment reinforces the importance of doing so. An example of our effort is the implementation of digital solutions across the company. Beyond the benefit of transforming how we design, test and manufacture the next generation of systems, our digital initiatives are streamlining business functions and increasing productivity. We are also optimizing our facilities and consolidating our real estate footprint. Every day, we seek new and innovative ways to drive performance and increased efficiency while remaining agile and meeting our customers' expectations. Our capital deployment strategy supports our business strategy. We are investing to not only drive efficiencies but also to allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment.In 2022, we invested over 7% of revenue in R&amp;D and capital expenditures to provide the capability and capacity needed to address the threats of today and tomorrow. We also continue to return cash to shareholders. Last year, we increased our dividend by 10%, which was the 19th consecutive increase. And during the year, we delivered over $1 billion to shareholders through the dividend and returned another $1.5 billion through share repurchases. So looking forward to 2023, we are well positioned for continued growth, and our revenue outlook has improved from the high $37 billion range we shared in October. We now expect sales to be in the range of $38 billion to $38.4 billion, representing about 4.5% growth at the midpoint. Margins are expected to remain solid in the 11.3% to 11.5% range.We are projecting strong free cash flow growth that supports our capital deployment strategy. And we expect to return more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in 2023. Our backlog, strong recent global demand growth and our ability to deliver products that address an increasingly complex security environment give us confidence in our outlook. So with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to cover the details of our financial results and more on guidance.David Keffer: Okay. Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. I also want to thank our team for another year of strong performance in 2022. We won several new franchise programs, delivered industry-leading top line growth and bolstered our talented workforce, with the addition of over 6,000 net employees during the year. I'll spend a few minutes on our fourth quarter and 2022 results and then discuss our future expectations in more detail, including our long-term cash flow projections. We ended the year with nearly $79 billion in backlog, reflecting strong demand for our products and capabilities. We continue to convert our backlog into revenue at an accelerating rate with fourth quarter sales growth of 16%. This was enabled by our ability to continue strong hiring in Q4 as well as a higher volume of material receipts based on the timing of program demand.The team did an outstanding job of working with our supply chain to secure program material. And for the full year, our sales grew to $36.6 billion, representing organic growth of 3% and exceeding our prior expectations. Our operating performance and margins remained solid despite the continued pressures of the macroeconomic environment. Our segment operating margin rate was slightly below our expectations at 11.3% in Q4 and 11.6% for the full year due in part to the impacts of inflation, which resulted in a lower level of net earnings adjustments. But margin dollar volume was very strong given the top line outperformance. A positive EAC adjustment in the quarter was on B-21, where we recognized a $66 million pickup on the EMD phase of the program, reflecting our latest assumptions regarding future incentives in that phase.Continuing with our Q4 results. Our transaction adjusted earnings per share were $7.50, a 25% increase over the same period in 2021. Higher EPS were driven by robust growth in our segment top and bottom lines as well as a lower effective tax rate. The lower Q4 tax rate was driven by the recognition of an $86 million benefit from the resolution of a legacy Orbital ATK tax return, which we previewed in our guidance last quarter. And corporate unallocated costs were also below our expectations due to lower state taxes as a result of the R&amp;D tax amortization law not being deferred. For the full year, our transaction-adjusted earnings per share were $25.54, well ahead of our guidance range. Now turning to cash. We had an extremely strong fourth quarter, consistent with our historical pattern.For the year, we generated $2.9 billion of operating cash flow and $1.6 billion of transaction-adjusted free cash flow, in line with our expectations. This was inclusive of a full year of cash taxes associated with the R&amp;D tax amortization law as well as our final payment of deferred payroll taxes from the Cares Act legislation. Moving to our pension plans. Slide 7 in our earnings deck includes our latest assumptions. After 3 consecutive years of double-digit asset returns, our plans declined by roughly 15% in 2022, in line with market trends. Our FAS discount rate increased roughly 250 basis points to 5.54%, which was the driver of the mark-to-market pension benefit of $1.2 billion reflected in our GAAP results. These factors are also reflected in our latest pension estimates for 2023 to 2025.As we previewed last quarter and updated in our slides today, we're projecting a decline in our noncash net FAS pension income and an increase in our estimated CAS recoveries. In total, our pension plans remain strong. As a result of the higher discount rate, our funded status has improved to nearly 100%, and we continue to project minimal cash pension contributions over the next several years. Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our revenue expectations have increased from our prior estimates, with the midpoint representing nearly 4.5% growth on top of the strong level in 2022. We expect Space Systems to remain our fastest-growing business. Sales are projected in the mid-$13 billion range, up over $1 billion from 2022 levels, with GBSD and NGI contributing nearly half of the growth and the rest coming from our broad space portfolio.Mission Systems sales are expected in the high $10 billion range, up mid-single digits, driven by restricted programs in our Networked Information Solutions business. And we continue to expect flattish sales at both Aeronautics and Defense Systems. While programs like B-21 and IBCS continue to grow, headwinds remain on legacy platforms as systems are retired. We expect Aeronautics and Defense Systems to return to growth in 2024. And similar to our cadence in 2022, we expect first quarter sales of approximately 24% of our full year estimate, with sales ramping again throughout the year. With respect to margins, we expect our 2023 segment operating margin rate to be down roughly 20 basis points from 2022 levels. Challenging macroeconomic conditions, including extended lead times in the supply chain and high levels of inflation continue to put temporal pressure on margins.And while higher CAS recoveries provide a modest benefit to our cash flow in the coming years that create pressure in our overhead rates and EACs. Similar in nature to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 when we recognized a favorable impact from lower projected CAS costs, this could lead to an unfavorable margin impact when we update our rates this quarter. We notionally expect this to have a 10 to 20 basis point impact on the full year. In regard to the B-21 program, we expect the 2023 contract award for the first of 5 LRIP lots with the LRIP phase scheduled to run through approximately the end of the decade. We're continuing to work with our customer to address macroeconomic risks and enhance efficiencies in the program. As we've described in our 10-K, we do not believe that a loss on the LRIP phase is probable and therefore, no such loss is reflected in our results or guidance.Now turning to our future outlook. We expect our 2023 earnings per share to range between $21.85 and $22.45 based on approximately 153 million weighted shares outstanding. This includes $450 million of net pension income, which represents a $4.30 per share headwind compared to 2022. Partially offsetting this nonoperational headwind is strong growth in segment performance and the lower share count, which adds roughly $0.90 of additional earnings per share and lower purchase intangible amortization largely offsets the higher tax rate. Moving to cash. We expect 2023 adjusted free cash flow between $1.85 billion and $2.15 billion, consistent with our prior outlook as adjusted for current R&amp;D tax law. Although we expect discussions to continue on Capitol Hill, our guidance and multiyear outlook are now based on current tax law for all years and do not include any refunds for R&amp;D taxes paid in 2022.Capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated at $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion in 2023 and a similar level in 2024 before moderating in 2025 and beyond. This is driven by investments to support several large new business wins from 2022. Our guidance assumes we will not have an extended CR, a breach of the debt ceiling or a prolonged government shutdown as this is our current expectation. Slide 12 in our earnings deck provides our long-term cash outlook, which is predicated on continued top line growth in our business generating strong and gradually expanding operating margins and converting those margins into cash. R&amp;D-related cash tax payments should decline by about 20% per year. As I described, CapEx is expected to remain near 4.5% of sales in 2023 and 2024 before starting to decline in 2025.After investing in our business, we continue to expect to return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And we plan to be in the market for new debt issuance soon to support our capital deployment plans including the refinancing of near-term maturities. In summary, 2022 was another successful year for Northrop Grumman, and we continue to deliver value for our customers, employees and shareholders. And with that, we're ready to take your questions.See also 15 Biggest Natural Gas Pipeline Companies in the World and 13 Biggest Eyewear Companies in the World.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Treating all NFTs as financial assets will compromise the U.S.’ position as the gold standard of intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement.The immediate danger of this one-size-fits-all approach is that it will damage the commercial prospects of this emerging technology. NFTs are a medium for not only evolving the way we create, use and monetize IP, but also how artists and brands engage with their audiences. It is critical that policy efforts encourage and protect U.S. IP rights holders who are expanding their creative portfolios through NFTs.This article is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week. Diana Stern is general counsel at Palm NFT Studio.IP is a critical part of the U.S. economy. According to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), industries that intensively use IP protection, which include manufacturers, broadcasters and independent artists, account for over 41% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and employ one-third of the total workforce. American IP is worth $6.6 trillion, more than the nominal GDP of any other country in the world, and accounts for 52% of all U.S. merchandise exports, per the Chamber of Commerce’s Global IP Center (GIPC).An effective IP regime incentivizes creators and companies to generate new IP and capitalize on their rights in innovative ways. We are just starting to see how rights holders will do this by unlocking the potential of NFTs, which is part of the reason the USPTO requested information on this burgeoning industry last year.In corporate America, NFTs are crossing the chasm from novelty research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives, to meaningful digital marketing spend that outperforms traditional channels and even to entirely new ways to monetize IP portfolios. In 2022, Nike, Tiffany &amp; Co. and other household names sold NFTs resulting in tens of millions of dollars in revenue, and in Nike’s case over $1 billion in sales volume.Story continuesNFTs are contributing directly to the bottom line and transforming how companies connect with their audiences. Where in the past fan fiction may have resulted in a cease-and-desist letter or even a lawsuit from the IP rightsholder, today the preeminent U.S. comic book publisher DC Comics worked with Palm NFT Studio to create one of the largest writers’ rooms by inviting holders of its NFTs to shape the story of future comics. Companies have activated entire communities of brand ambassadors overnight through NFT drops, and holders can remain engaged over time through experiences only made available to them.Individual artists are also deepening their fan bases with engaging experiments. Digital illustrator Yam Karkai and her co-founders created the World of Women NFTs (WoW), a collection that celebrates art, representation, inclusivity and equal opportunities. WoW joined famed manager Guy Oseary’s star-studded clientele, inked a deal with Reese Witherspoon’s media company Hello Sunshine, and started a foundation dedicated to empowering women in Web3. U.S.-based artists Tyler Hobbs and Dandelion Wist Mané created QQL, a project that invites collectors to become co-creators by using the algorithm they designed to add an NFT to the collection. It successfully sold out to the tune of nearly $17 million in late 2022 when NFT sales had already cooled off, revealing potentially evergreen demand for innovative, IP-driven NFTs.See also: NFTs and Intellectual Property: What Do You Actually Own?Enforcing rightsCreators are already using copyright and trademark law to enforce their rights as they stake out their turf in the metaverse. For example, in Yuga Labs v. Ryder Ripps, a U.S. startup most recently valued at $4 billion, sued conceptual artist Ripps for trademark infringement when he made copies of their NFTs. In Nike v. StockX, Nike alleged that StockX infringed its trademarks when StockX made NFTs corresponding to physical shoes sold on its marketplace, which StockX argues is permitted under the first-sale doctrine.On the other end of the spectrum, the Creative Commons license known as CC0, whereby the work is made available for unrestricted reuse, has gained popularity within the NFT world.Not only is the U.S. IP rights regime supporting greater commercialization of IP portfolios through NFTs, but NFTs themselves can be part of the enforcement toolkit. Service of process has been given via NFT, and use cases for combating counterfeit and pirated goods are in the works.However, I would not suggest leaning into NFTs and the smart contracts we use to transact them as traditional digital rights management (DRM) tools, like software that prevents you from copying a song and sending it to a friend. You can right-click to copy and paste an image associated with an NFT. That does not mean you can use the NFT to access all the experiences verified holders can engage with, or that it will retain any value whatsoever. Ripping the image from an NFT is like having a photocopy of signed memorabilia with no certificate of authenticity. From an IP perspective, it does not mean you are now the legal owner of the image. Depending on how the NFT is licensed, you may have infringed the rights of the creator.Not all NFTs are like the IP-focused examples described here. Last year we saw the rise of financialized NFTs, including platforms where borrowers can use NFTs as collateral and projects offering high returns to “investors.” These may be subject to lending, securities and/or other financial regulations.The current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, has taken the position that most fungible tokens are securities. If the SEC and state securities regulators take a similarly sweeping view of the NFT market, it will chill the momentum of IP-driven NFTs. Regulatory constraints specific to securities would be imposed because of the technology these NFTs use, not because they are fit for purpose. Among other drawbacks, transferability of creative works would be severely limited and artists could inadvertently become investment companies.DisincentivesForcing all NFTs into a securities box will disincentivize enterprises and creators from taking advantage of new technologies and cut against the economic gains achieved by the U.S.’s IP regime. Economies with effective IP protection, like the U.S. today, are 70% more likely to produce more innovative output and nearly 40% more likely to attract venture capital and private equity, according to the GIPC.Furthermore, securities laws are not the appropriate framework for addressing the main regulatory risk present for IP-centric NFTs: potential consumer harm. Similar to other nascent industries, scammers are waiting in the wings to take advantage of newcomers and buggy beta tools.At the peak of inflated expectations for NFTs in 2021, many projects launched with grandiose claims and roadmap promises that went unfulfilled when the founders disappeared with purchasers’ funds – aka a “rug pull.” This should be stopped, and the U.S. Department of Justice demonstrated that it can – and will – effectively combat rug pulls when it brought criminal charges against the NFT projects known as Frosties and Mutant Ape Planet.See also: Should You Copyright Your NFTs? | OpinionThere is also a strong system for consumer protection in the U.S. under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General. Many rights holders are already familiar with consumer protection laws applying to their products and services, and can adjust existing guidelines, controls and review processes for NFTs.Rather than have the SEC lead the NFT space with a regulation by enforcement approach as it has with fungible tokens, the growth of NFTs should be guided by an IP-aware policy approach that addresses consumer harm while incentivizing artists, brands and fans to break open the possibilities offered by new technologies, ushering in the next wave of valuable IP.Otherwise, we will see runaway production of NFTs before we’ve seen a fraction of what U.S. creators and IP rights holders can do with them.]"

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Therefore, if you purchase Wells Fargo's shares on or after the 2nd of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 1st of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.30 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.20 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Wells Fargo has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current stock price of $46.12. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Wells Fargo's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Wells Fargo has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. That's why it's good to see Wells Fargo paying out a modest 35% of its earnings.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're discomforted by Wells Fargo's 5.3% per annum decline in earnings in the past five years. Such a sharp decline casts doubt on the future sustainability of the dividend.Story continuesAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Wells Fargo has increased its dividend at approximately 2.0% a year on average.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Wells Fargo for the upcoming dividend? Wells Fargo's earnings per share are down over the past five years, although it has the cushion of a low payout ratio, which would suggest a cut to the dividend is relatively unlikely. It might be worth researching if the company is reinvesting in growth projects that could grow earnings and dividends in the future, but for now we're on the fence about its dividend prospects.If you're not too concerned about Wells Fargo's ability to pay dividends, you should still be mindful of some of the other risks that this business faces. For example - Wells Fargo has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

NVAX is one of a handful of vaccine makers that has secured authorizations for its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine in the United States, the company still struggles to establish a foothold in the target market.Novavax developed its own novel coronavirus vaccine NVX-CoV2373, a protein-based vaccine that utilizes the company’s proprietary nanoparticle technology. The company is currently marketing two versions of NVX-CoV2373 — one marketed in partnership with the Serum Institute of India (Serum) under the trade name Covovax and another version produced by Novavax that is marketed under the trade name Nuvaxovid. In the United States, the vaccine is marketed as Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted.Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine is also its first marketed product which has also been authorized for emergency use in more than 40 countries, including the United States. The struggle for market share is due to the delayed product launch of the vaccine. The FDA filing for the protein-based vaccine, which was supposed to have been done by May 2021, was completed after multiple delays in January 2022.This delayed filing resulted in a substantial loss of market share to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA, who have not had a strong product launch but also established a strong hold on the market. By the time, Novavax was granted authorization for its vaccine, most of the population had already completed primary vaccination using Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s approved mRNA-based vaccines. The mRNA-based vaccines were also the first ones authorized by the FDA in 2020.This was also one of the likely reasons for management to slash Novavax’s total 2022 revenue guidance down to $2 billion from the previously provided range of $4-$5 billion. Like mRNA-based vaccines, Novavax vaccines have demonstrated high levels of efficacy against even mild disease.Story continuesThe vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are the only ones that have received full approval for use in adults in the United States. While Moderna’s vaccine is approved for adults aged 18 years and older, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is approved for use in individuals aged 12 years and older. Both these vaccines are also authorized for use in individuals aged six months and above in the United States. Novavax’s vaccine is currently authorized as a primary regimen in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have also secured EUA from the FDA for using their respective Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccines as a single booster dose. The bivalent vaccines of these companies are authorized for use inindividuals aged six months and older.Novavax is also lagging in the development of Omicron-specific vaccines. This makes the company vulnerable in terms of gaining a substantial market share in the targeted space.(NOTE: This article is being re-issued to correct a mistake.

In the last reported quarter, the company beat earnings by 8.74%.Factors at PlayBristol-Myers posted 5% growth in Total In-line Product Revenues in the last reported quarter. Demand is likely to have improved in the fourth quarter. The blood thinner drug, Eliquis, was one of the top revenue generators in the last reported quarter and posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. The solid performance of the drug is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, but pricing pressure is expected to have impacted sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the drug is pegged at $2.8 billion, while our estimate is $3 billion.Sales of key the immuno-oncology drug Opdivo grew 7% in the prior quarter and similar or higher levels of growth are expected for the to-be-reported quarter on consistent label expansions. In particular, higher demand across multiple indications, including Opdivo plus Yervoy-based combinations for non-small cell lung cancer, Opdivo plus Cabometyx for kidney cancer and Opdivo-based therapies for various gastric, bladder and esophageal cancers, has likely fueled sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the drug and our estimate both stand at $2.2 billion.Pomalyst posted a decent performance in the third quarter, with sales growth of 4%, primarily driven by the demand for triplet-based regimens in earlier lines, extending the duration of treatment for patient and the trend is likely to have prevailed in the fourth quarter.Arthritis drug Orencia posted a 1% rise in the previous quarter and the fourth quarter is likely to have witnessed similar levels of growth.Story continuesMelanoma drug Yervoy generated 2% growth in the previous quarter. The fourth quarter is likely to have experienced increased contributions from label expansions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the drug and our estimate stand at $585 million and $599 million, respectively.Among the new products, Reblozyl posted 19% growth in the last reported quarter and demand is likely to have been higher in the fourth quarter. Abecma and Breyanzi are likely to have seen increased uptake and sequential growth.However, Revlimid’s revenues declined 28% in the third quarter on generic erosion across several countries and foreign exchange. The decline is likely to have accelerated in the fourth quarter.Abraxane revenues also declined 33% on lower demand due to the entry of authorized generics. Revenues from this drug have most likely decreased in the fourth quarter too.Opdualag has also been approved in Europe and the drug has most likely registered a sequential increase in the fourth quarter.Operating expenses are likely to have increased in the fourth quarter due to costs associated with the broader portfolio.Key Recent DevelopmentsThe FDA recently approved its experimental candidate deucravacitinib to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, under the brand name Sotyktu. The company has most likely generated some revenues in the fourth quarter from this drug.The board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 57 cents per share, representing a 5.6% increase over last year’s quarterly dividend rate of 54 cents per share. The dividend is payable on Feb 1, 2023, to stockholders of record at the close of business on Jan 6, 2023.What Our Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Bristol-Myers this time around.

It also recommended simplifying the immunization schedule for the administration of these vaccines.The VRBPAC suggested that, based on available immunogenicity and effectiveness data, the bivalent vaccines fulfill this criterion. Data from multiple studies conducted by vaccine developers have suggested that bivalent vaccines improve antibody response compared with monovalent vaccines.In the United States, the currently authorized bivalent vaccines contain an mRNA encoding the spike protein in the original/monovalent vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.The approved/authorized COVID-19 vaccines have different compositions and immunization schedules. This has led to multiple complexities regarding using the vaccine, thereby leading to complications in vaccine administration and uptake. For instance, the vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, Modernaand Novavax must be administered as two-dose series for the primary regimen, while J&amp;J’s COVID vaccine only requires a single dose administration. The vaccines developed by Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer/BioNTech also have different dosing regimens for different age groups. Hence, there is a need to simplify the current COVID-19 vaccination regimen.The committee believes this simplification could be achieved by designing an age- and risk-based immunization schedule. The VRBPAC members suggested administering a single dose to the general population who have already been immunized and additional doses to individuals who are either at high risk or are yet to be immunized.Story continuesWhile Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna already have authorized bivalent vaccines for use in individuals aged six months and older, Novavax has stated that it requires six months to produce a new version of its protein-based COVID-19 vaccine designed to match circulating COVID-19 variants.In addition, the VRBPAC also considered proposals to adopt an annual COVID vaccination schedule similar to that adopted in the case of influenza vaccines. However, the FDA committee could not arrive at a decision due to a lack of available data supporting this proposal. The VRBPAC plans to meet later this year to discuss the same.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this refiner have returned +16.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, which Marathon Petroleum falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $5.54 per share, indicating a change of +326.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +25% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $25.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +924.9%. This estimate has changed +15.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.50 indicates a change of -34.3% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +15.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $32.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -10.1%. The $171.34 billion and $122.37 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.7% and -28.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.8%. EPS of $7.81 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.43%. The EPS surprise was +14.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is Friday, after all. A report in ""The Wall Street Journal"" detailing how Molson Coors is tapping DraftKings to build the buzz surrounding its first Super Bowl commercial in more than 30 years, the opening created by AB InBev surrendering its exclusivity to advertise in the big game. Molson then began a campaign to decide which beer, Coors Light or Miller Lite, deserves the Super Bowl spotlight. Here's where the collaboration comes in.If you have or sign up for a DraftKings account, you'll answer a dozen questions, like which beer is mentioned first? What type of dog is featured behind the bar? And then you're in. You're eligible to win a share of $500,000 in cash. And you don't have to pay to enter. It seems like an interesting collaboration. DraftKings and FanDuel will advertise in the Super Bowl.That's seven mil for 30 seconds, DraftKings cashing in up almost 7% today and more than 30% this year. Molson Coors, on the other hand, down, presumably not on this news, still up more than 3% for the year, really just shows you how much these-- not just the exclusivity for AB InBev gone, but DraftKings FanDuel going to be a real part of this Super Bowl. Now that we know it won't be the Crypto Bowl anymore, I think sports gambling will take its place.- At least for this year. I don't know if we can count crypto out in the future, though. But I mean, this is such a smart play all around. It's a smart play on DraftKings' part, obviously, because you get that exposure, 100 million eyeballs on the Super Bowl, clearly a massive opportunity here for that business.It's also very smart by Coors they're capitalizing on the rise and the popularity of sports betting, something we have clearly seen over the last several years. And that fan engagement is something that is so key, so important. It's a perfect way to combine everything that brands need to be doing in this day and age. I'm excited for it. Are you going to be doing it? Are you entering?Story continues- Of course I am. I'm going to enter by the end of the day. And beer and gambling, I mean, let's go.- You can't say no.- You want to know what's winning this year?- Win-win.- Real quick, YFi Interactive, here's beer. Here's beer. We want to show you this. All right, now here is gambling. Boom. Gambling is winning.- Gambling, the clear winner by a mile so far.]"

Tesla revealed the Cybertruck is slated to begin production later this summer, though Musk clarified on the call that volume production would only really happen in 2024.“The most important catalyst is Cybertruck,” Black said. “We've been waiting for four years, there's 1.3 million preorders. That is a huge catalyst if they can get that out by the end of the year and then early next year.”Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk gestures while wrapping up his presentation of the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck at Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, California on November 21, 2019.

Since then, however, the Ford F-150 Lightning EV pickup has been released, along with Rivian’s R1T. Later this year, GM will release its Chevrolet Silverado EV, and in 2024, Ram’s 1500 EV pickup will join the competition.While the EV pickup battlefield will be fierce, none of the competitors has anything that resembles the Cybertruck in terms of looks. Nor can they match Tesla’s EV production prowess at this time.Story continuesBlack in fact is putting his money where is mouth is, with his own Cybertruck on pre-order.“I can't wait to drive it up to Nobu in Chicago and leave it there and have all the kids take pictures of it,” he says. “It's so radical looking that you either love it or you hate it, and I think it's beautiful. I think it's going to be a huge seller.”—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Our fourth quarter concluded a challenging and volatile year that impacted our ability to deliver on our expectations and our financial performance. At the same time, we ended the year with positive momentum with consumer consumption trends and flavor solutions demand, stabilized service levels and supply and meaningful progress in starting to reshape our cost structure. While more work remains to be done, our confidence in our outlook for 2023 and beyond is strong. Our organization is focused squarely on executing on the priorities I just mentioned. All of which are important drivers in the successful execution of our strategies and the delivery of stronger results.Story continuesTurning to Slide 5, at our fourth quarter results, our sales declined 2% from the year ago period, including a 4% unfavorable impact from currency. In constant currency, sales grew 2% within our implied fourth quarter guidance range, but below our expectations. Greater-than-expected COVID-related disruptions in China unfavorably impacted our expected sales growth for both total McCormick and the Consumer segment by approximately 2%. Fourth quarter sales would have grown in the range of 4% in constant currency, excluding the impact of China on our results. We had anticipated even higher growth with fourth quarter restocking comparisons in the Americas Consumer segment further tempered our growth. As compared to last year, our fourth quarter constant currency sales growth of 2% reflected a 9% contribution from pricing actions partially offset by a 4% decline in underlying volume and product mix, an expected 2% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the exit of low-margin business in India and the consumer business in Russia and a 1% year-over-year volume decline from the China COVID-related disruption.Despite tempered fourth quarter sales performance, our underlying sales strength positions us well to accelerate sales growth in 2023. In our Consumer segment, excluding China, consumption trends strengthened, particularly in the U.S., where our fourth quarter total branded consumption grew 6%. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our sales growth was outstanding, continued momentum across all regions. Consumers increasing demand for flavor, whether through our products or our customers' product is those reflected in this performance and in our most recent proprietary consumer insights research. Our alignment with the long-term consumer trends of cooking at home, clean and flavorful eating and valuing trusted brands continues to deliver results.This alignment, combined with our broad and advantaged portfolio, plus the fundamental strength of our category continues to underscore McCormick's positioning for long-term differentiated growth in flavor. Moving to profit, our adjusted operating income decline of 10% or 9% in constant currency and adjusted earnings per share decline of 13% fell short of our expectations. Let me spend a moment on the differences to our expectation. Unfavorable product mix was a driving factor, particularly in our Consumer segment. This was primarily due to lower U.S. bites and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparison in both 2021 and 2022, which I will discuss in a moment. Our results also reflected lower-than-anticipated sales in China and an unfavorable product mix related to the sales mix between segments.In addition, with two COVID-related plant shutdowns in China, we realized lower operating leverage. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress to lower our run-rate cost in flavor solutions with the reduction of elevated costs that we have been incurring to meet high demand in parts of our business. The impact of that progress was offset in the fourth quarter by unexpected discrete one-time issues. However, we expect to see positive benefits in our results going forward. Turning to Slide 7, we are committed to increasing our profit realization in 2023. In our last earnings call, we discussed normalizing our supply chain costs and increasing efficiencies while also strengthening our ability to service customers. To that end, we have targeted the elimination of $100 million of supply chain costs over the next 2 years.We are also now taking streamlining actions across our entire organization targeting an incremental $25 million of cost savings. The combination of these actions, which is our global operating effectiveness program, is incremental to our comprehensive continuous improvement or CCI savings. Our CCI program has a well-established track record of success and we are leveraging its proven program discipline to drive results. We expect our global operating effectiveness program to drive annual cost savings of approximately $125 million, of which we expect to realize $75 million through the P&amp;L in 2023, enabling increased profit realization. We can see the results coming through and we expect the impact to scale up as the year progresses. Now, let me share more details on our actions.During last year, we transitioned to our global operating model allowing us to more effectively leverage our scale and drive cost reductions. As we further advance that model and streamline our processes, strengthen our collaboration and align our structure to work more efficiently, we are taking corresponding actions to streamline our workforce across the entire organization. We are making considerable progress on the streamlining actions we have underway. A large component of our streamlining actions is a U.S. voluntary retirement program, which is very far along with a targeted separation date of February 1. This will be followed by other actions, some of which will be involuntary. As always, we will care for employees in keeping with our shared value.Moving to the supply chain. Our top supply chain priority remains keeping our customers in supply and supporting their growth. And while we expect continued volatility in global supply chain, we have strengthened our resiliency over the past few years to achieve this priority. As we responded to demand volatility over the past several years, we incurred additional costs above inflation, service our customers and have seen inefficiencies to develop in our supply chain. Some of these costs for investments and decisions made to support continued growth for both our customers and McCormick and some are the result of a buildup that can occur in periods of disruption. In 2022, with the service levels of focus the normalization of our supply chain costs and inventory levels has taken longer than expected.As we stated on our third quarter call, during the fourth quarter, we began to implement initiatives to optimize our cost structure, increase our capacity and reduce inventory levels while strengthening our supply chain resiliency and ability to service our customers. Now for some details on these initiatives. First and foremost, while we continue to resolve some outliers, we have rebuilt and stabilized our service back to strong levels and at a high level of finished goods inventory on hand. Operating from this position enables us to maximize our performance, reduce our labor costs and pare back excessive use of co-packers within our operations. Starting with labor as we expect it to be the most significant driver of our cost reductions, during the fourth quarter, we reinstated more normal shift schedule with most locations now operating on a 24/5 pattern.This allows us to eliminate inefficient and unpopular difficult to staff shifts. Additionally, as we move away from the industry-wide labor issues seen during the pandemic, we have stabilized absenteeism and turnover rates in our workforce and returned to more standard staffing by line. During the quarter, we optimized our leadership structure throughout our facilities and upgraded the talented key roles. Simultaneously, we are increasing the capability levels of our team. We are also accelerating automation, bringing for individual pieces of equipment to a completely automated line for a high-volume packaging format. We expect through these initiatives to reduce 10% of our Americas supply chain workforce. And over the past 3 months, we have already achieved half of the planned reduction.Next, turning to our capacity. We are supporting future growth and enabling better customer service by investing to increase both manufacturing capacity and reliability in constrained areas. These investments also enable the repatriation of the production we scaled up at co-packers while continuing to meet the elevated demand. In our Flavor Solutions segment, our flavors volume, including seasonings and flavor encapsulation, has been growing at a mid single-digit rate for each of the past 3 years and demand remains strong. Our investments in additional seasoning capacity as well as spring dry capacity with the expansion of bonus footprint are on track to be online during the second quarter. Meanwhile, in our Consumer segment, we have been using co-packers for targeted high-demand packaging format such as some of our large value sized items.Now given the efficiencies gained and the investments already in flight, we have started to repatriate some of these formats. Overall, we are on track for co-pack spending in 2023 to be the lowest in the past 5 years. From an inventory perspective, we are executing on initiatives to return to historical safety stock levels which has been disrupted and raised by the supply chain issues of the last few years. We reduced both raw material and finished good inventory during the fourth quarter. While we are aware we have further progress to make, we are confident and encouraged by the results our initiatives are delivering so far. As we progress to a more normalized environment, we will realize additional benefits from these changes. For example, we expect to see reductions in expedited freight and less than truckload shipping costs and will streamline other transportation inefficiencies.With the recent opening of our new Maryland logistics center, we are able to eliminate expensive external warehouse costs before even fully realizing the inventory reduction, accelerating the expense savings. With more efficient manufacturing and lower inventory levels, we expect low material losses. We have managed through various supply chain challenges over the last several years. I am confident in our disciplined approach to resolving the increased cost within our supply chain while prioritizing meeting our customers' needs. The impact of our actions is expected to normalize our supply chain cost, enhance our efficiency and ability to meet demand, reduce inventory levels and ultimately increase our profit realization as reflected in our 2023 outlook.Our global operating effectiveness program has considerable momentum and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you after our first quarter of 2023. Now moving to fourth quarter business updates for each of our segments. Turning to our Consumer segment on Slide 8, sales performance in the quarter was impacted by factors mentioned previously, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, exits of businesses and COVID-related disruptions in China as well as trade inventory dynamics between years. These factors as well as lapping high COVID-related demand early in the year also impacted the full year performance. Importantly, on a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at a 5% CAGR, driven by the Americas region, but we are ending the year with positive momentum in our consumption trend.Now for some regional highlights on sales and consumption. Starting with the Americas, during the fourth quarter of 2021 because we were restocking, shipments were higher than consumption and we are lapping that this quarter, which impacts our sales growth. As we entered the holiday season this year and having shifted fairly in line with consumption for the first three quarters of the year, customers did not need to replenish their inventory as much despite strong consumer consumption during the holiday season. We estimate our fourth quarter sales growth rate was unfavorably impacted 6% related to these restocking comparisons. We did not fully appreciate the level of fourth quarter restocking in 2021, especially of high-margin holiday herbs and spices and the resulting impact on our year-over-year growth and as such, had expected stronger sales growth this year.That said excluding this impact, our underlying volume performance in the fourth quarter was better than in the second and third quarters. We have confidence that as we move out of the first quarter, the holiday season fluctuations this year between consumption and inventory levels as well as retailer restocking resulting from pandemic-driven dynamics will have normalized and we have an increased level of confidence in our visibility. Our total U.S. branded portfolio consumption growth was 6% this quarter, as indicated by our IRI consumption data combined with unmeasured channel was the strongest of the year. Our investments in brand marketing and stronger holiday merchandising proved to be effective. And with the stabilization of supply disruptions, restoration of our service levels continued and our fourth quarter service level was the best of the year, just shy of our pre-pandemic standards.Our consumption dollar sales, unit and volume all accelerated sequentially and our total distribution points or TDPs have stabilized. In spices and seasoning, our fourth quarter performance was the strongest of the year. Consumers are responding to our value messaging, trading up to larger sizes and according to our consumer insights are learning to navigate the current environment. We are continuing to build distribution on the Lawry's everyday spice range we launched last quarter and early results are positive. We are seeing incremental sales and profit to the category as consumers are trading up to this line for private label. In recipe mixes, we gained share for the fifth consecutive quarter and with improved packaging supply, we also gained share in hot sauce and mustard during the quarter.Across the portfolio, our trends are continuing to strengthen in the first quarter of 2023. In EMEA, we ended the year with our strongest sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our effective pricing and new product growth accelerated versus the first three quarters with our fourth quarter price realization, the highest of the year and our volume decline, the lowest. Our strong consumption momentum continued and accelerated sequentially. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we gained share versus last year and 2019 in the UK and Eastern Europe herbs, spices and seasoning. Those gains were somewhat offset by softer performance in France. In the UK, we are driving the hot sauce category with Frank's RedHot continuing to gain share again in the quarter and for the full year versus last year as well as compared to 2019.Additionally, in the UK, we advanced our recipe mix leadership during 2022 to the number one share position. As we entered 2023, we are confident in our continued momentum in the EMEA region. In the Asia-Pacific region, growth for the quarter and the year was impacted by the exit of low margin business in India, which we will lap after the first quarter of 2023 as well as the COVID-related disruption in China. Reflected in our outlook, we are expecting continued disruption into the first quarter of 2023 with an expected recovery after the Chinese New Year. While we are currently experiencing the short-term pressure, we continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of our business in China. Our brand marketing, new products and category management initiatives are driving positive momentum with more to come from 2023 and we look forward to sharing this and our growth plans at CAGNY in a few weeks.Turning to Flavor Solutions on Slide 9, sales growth reflected pricing actions as well as higher base volume growth in new products. Our sales performance has been outstanding all year, led by double-digit growth every quarter in the Americas and EMEA regions, resulting in 12% growth for the full year. On a 3-year basis, we have grown annual sales at an 8% CAGR with strong growth in all three regions. Now for some regional highlights. Our Americas fourth quarter sales growth was the strongest of the year. Growth in flavors, including snack seasonings and flavors for performance nutrition and health end market applications, as well as branded foodservice products drove our fourth quarter performance as well as our strong broad-based growth for the year.We continue to realize the benefits from the combined capabilities of FONA and McCormick with new products contributing approximately 30% more growth in Flavors in 2022 than last year. Demand continues to strengthen with branded foodservice restaurant and institutional foodservice customers and we are also expanding distribution and gaining share in both spices and seasonings and hot sauce. In EMEA, our strong fourth quarter performance in all product categories capped an outstanding year of 17% growth, including significant volume growth of 9% as well as pricing. We are winning in all markets and channels. Growth remains strong across our customer base led by the momentum with our quick-service restaurant or QSR customers, partially driven by expanded distribution and their promotional activities.In APV, we are driving further menu penetration with our QSR customers, realizing growth from strong performance of core menu item sweet flavor. We delivered solid growth in the APC region for the year despite the COVID-related disruptions in China. Across markets outside of China, we drove double-digit growth with contributions from both volume and pricing. Overall, Flavor Solutions demand has remained strong. And for certain parts of our business in the Americas and EMEA regions, our supply chain continues to be pressured to meet this high demand, driving extraordinary costs to service our customers. We appreciate our customers working with us and are encouraged by the results our collaboration is already beginning to yield. While our Flavor Solutions sales growth has been outstanding, we are not delivering profit growth in this segment.We are committed to restoring Flavor Solutions profitability, recovering margin while ensuring we keep our customers in supply and driving growth for both McCormick and our customers. We are confident we will achieve margin recovery through three actions, effective price realization. Our price increases are only now catching up to the pace of inflation and we are beginning to recover the cost inflation or pricing live last year. The successful execution of the global operating effectiveness program I just mentioned, in particular, we expect the elimination of supply chain inefficiencies and the investments in capacity to have a significant impact in the Flavor Solutions segment. And finally, continued focus on driving growth in high-margin parts of our portfolio.The strength of our Flavor Solutions portfolio and capabilities, including our customer engagement approach and culinary inspired innovation are driving our outstanding flavor solution momentum. We look to sharing more about our growth plan and margin recovery at CAGNY in a few weeks. Now some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. Turning to Slide 10, global demand for Flavor remains the foundation of our sales growth and we have intentionally focused on great fast-growing categories that will continue to differentiate our performance. We continue to capitalize on the long-term consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, healthy and flavorful cooking, increased digital engagement, trusted brands and purpose-minded practices.These long-term trends and the rise in global demand for great taste are more relevant today than ever, but the younger generation stealing them at a greater rate. McCormick is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand for great taste with the breadth and reach of our strong global flavor portfolio we are delivering flavor experiences for every meal occasion through our products and our customers' products and are driving growth. We are end-to-end flavor. We remain focused on the long-term goals, strategies and values that have made us so successful. We have grown and compounded that growth over the years, including through the pandemic and other periods of volatility. The strength of our business model, the value of our products and capabilities and the execution of our proven strategies by our experienced leaders while adapting to changes accordingly, give us confidence in our growth momentum and in our ability to navigate the dynamic global environment.As we look ahead to 2023, we will focus on capitalizing on strong demand optimizing our cost structure and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. The fundamentals that drove our industry leading historical financial performance remains strong and we are confident we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in 2023. I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world for their contributions in 2022 and the momentum they are driving in 2023. Now, I will turn it over to Mike.Mike Smith: Thanks, Lawrence and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 13, our top line constant currency sales grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This growth was tempered by a 1% unfavorable impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, a 1% impact from the exits of low-margin business in India and the customer business in Russia and a 1% impact from China consumption disruption related to COVID restrictions. In our Consumer segment, constant currency sales declined 4% with the divestiture of Kitchen Basics contributing 1% to the decline and the combined impact of exiting the businesses in India and Russia as well as the China consumption disruption, contributing 3% to the decline. On Slide 14, consumer sales in the Americas declined 4% in constant currency.Pricing actions in the region were more than offset by a volume decline, including a 2% impact from the Kitchen Basics divestiture as well as a 6% impact from lapping the restocking and retail inventory in the fourth quarter of last year and a higher level of retail inventories entering this year's holiday season. Additionally, returning to pre-pandemic promotional levels also tempered our sales comparison to the fourth quarter of last year. In EMEA, constant currency consumer sales grew 2%. Pricing actions across all markets were partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 4% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia. Constant currency consumer sales in the Asia-Pacific region declined 22%, including a 23% unfavorable impact from the consumption disruption in China as well as the exit of low margin business in India.Pricing actions in all markets across the region partially offset this unfavorable impact. Turning to our Flavor Solutions segment on Slide 17, we grew fourth quarter constant currency sales 14% primarily due to pricing actions with higher volume and product mix also contributing to growth in all regions. In the Americas, Flavor Solutions constant currency sales grew 13%, with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Higher sales of packaged food and beverage companies with strength in snack seasonings, led the growth. Higher demand for branded foodservice customers also contributed to growth. In EMEA, we drove 16% constant currency sales growth, with 10% related to pricing actions and 6% behind the mix. EMEA's Flavor Solutions growth was broad-based across this portfolio, led by strong growth with QSR and packaged food and beverage company customers.In the Asia-Pacific region, Flavor Solutions sales grew 11% in constant currency with pricing actions and higher volume contributing to the increase. Growth was driven by higher sales to QSR customers, driven by strength in their core menu items. As seen on Slide 21, adjusted gross margin declined 410 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the year ago period. I will spend a moment on the significant drivers, highlighting the ones that drove more compression than we had expected. First, approximately 60% of this decline or 250 basis points is due to the dilutive impact of pricing to offset our dollar cost increases. Next, product mix was unfavorable as compared to the fourth quarter of last year, as well as compared to our expectations for the quarter.First, in our Consumer segment. As mentioned earlier, lower U.S. spices and seasoning sales stemming from fourth quarter inventory restocking comparisons in both 2021 and 2022, as well as lower sales of higher-margin products in China due to the COVID restrictions negatively impacted mix. Sales shift between our Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments also contributed to the unfavorable product mix as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The impact of the unfavorable product mix was higher than we expected due to the shortfall in consumer sales from what we had anticipated driven by both lower U.S. and China sales. Now for the impact of supply chain challenges on gross margins. In our Consumer segment, we experienced lower operating leverage because of the sales comparisons already discussed.The impact, though, was greater than expected due to the China COVID-related plant shutdowns. In our Flavor Solutions segment, as we transition production to our new UK Peterborough manufacturing facility, we continue to incur dual running costs. We expect the unfavorable year-over-year impact of these costs to continue in the first quarter of 2023. And then for the balance of the year, expect them to be comparable to 2022. Additionally, we are still incurring elevated costs to meet high demand in certain parts of our business. While painful short-term, we know these investments to support our customers during periods of disruption are the right approach to drive long-term growth. That said, we did make progress on reducing the level of these costs in the fourth quarter.However, the impact of that progress was offset by the unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates and some discrete issues we experienced in our Flavor Solutions operations during the quarter. While we recovered quickly from these issues, they still contributed significant unexpected costs to the quarter. Finally, partially offsetting the unfavorable drivers I just mentioned were our CCI cost savings. And of note, our price increases continue to catch up with cost inflation during the quarter for both segments. This was in line with our expectations and consistent with our performance. In 2023, we plan to fully recover the inflation or pricing has lagged over the last 2 years. Now moving to Slide 22. Selling, general and administration expenses for SG&amp;A declined from the fourth quarter of last year with lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by higher distribution costs and brand marketing investments.As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A declined 270 basis points. The net impact of the factors I just mentioned resulted in a constant currency decline in adjusted operating income, which excludes special charges and transaction and integration costs of 9% and compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. In constant currency, the Consumer segment's adjusted operating income declined 5%. And in the Flavor Solutions segment, it declined 26%. Turning to interest expense and income taxes on Slide 23, our interest expense increased significantly over the fourth quarter 2021 as well as over our third quarter of this year, both driven by the higher rate environment. Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 21.3% in the year-ago period.Both periods were favorably impacted by discrete tax items with a more significant impact last year. At the bottom line, as shown on Slide 24, fourth quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share was $0.73 as compared to $0.84 for the year ago period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower adjusted operating income with higher interest expense and a higher fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate also contributing to the decrease. On Slide 25, we've summarized highlights for cash flow and the year-end balance sheet. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $652 million, which is lower than the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower net income and higher inventory levels. We returned $397 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and used $262 million for capital expenditures in 2022.Our capital expenditures included growth investments and optimization projects across the globe. In 2023, we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to 2022 as we continue to spend on the initiatives we have in progress as well as to support our investments to fuel future growth. We expect 2023 to be a year of strong cash flow driven by our profit and working capital initiatives. Our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash, funding investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and paying down debt. We remain committed to a strong investment grade rating and we have a history of strong cash generation and profit realization. With improving our gross margin, through our plan to normalize our supply chain costs and inventory levels, we will be better positioned to continue paying down debt and expect to de-lever to approximately 3x by the end of fiscal 2024.Now turning to our 2023 financial outlook on Slide 26, our 2023 outlook reflects our positive top line growth momentum and with the optimization of our cost structure, increased profit realization. We expect to drive margin expansion with strong sales and adjusted operating income growth that reflects the health of our underlying business performance as well as the net favorable impact from several discrete drivers. We expect our adjusted operating profit growth will be partially offset below operating profit by significantly higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate. We also expect there will be minimal impact from currency rates. At the top line, we expect to grow sales 5% to 7%, driven primarily by the wrap of last year's pricing actions combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023.We expect several factors to impact our volume and product mix over the course of the year, including price elasticities, which we expect to be consistent with 2022 at low levels that we have historically experienced, but in line with the current environment. A 1% estimated benefit from lapping last year's impact of COVID-related disruptions in China. Although we expect the impact will vary from quarter-to-quarter given 2022's level of demand volatility. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business in August of last year and the exit of our consumer business in Russia during last year's second quarter. And finally, the continued pruning of lower margin business from our portfolio. As always, we plan to drive growth through the strength of our brands as well as our category management, brand marketing, new products and customer engagement plans.Our 2023 adjusted gross margin is projected to range between 25 to 75 basis points higher than 2022. This adjusted gross margin expansion reflects a favorable impact from pricing, cost savings from our CCI-led and global operating effectiveness programs, partially offset by the anticipated impact of a low to mid-teens increase in cost inflation. We expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing during the year as we recover the cost inflation or pricing lag last year. Moving to adjusted operating income. First, let me walk through some discrete items and their expected impact to our 2023 adjusted operating profit growth. First, the cost savings from our global operating effectiveness program are expected to have an 800 basis point impact.The savings from this program are expected to scale up as the year progresses. Next, the benefit of lapping the impact of COVID-related disruptions in China is expected to have a 300 basis point favorable impact. The Kitchen Basics divestiture is expected to have an unfavorable 100 basis point impact. And finally, an 800 basis point unfavorable impact is expected as we build back incentive compensation. The net impact of these discrete items is a favorable 200 basis points. This favorable impact, combined with expected 7% to 9% underlying business growth, which is driven by our improved operating momentum results in our adjusted operating income projection of 9% to 11%. In addition to the adjusted gross margin impacts I just mentioned, this projection also includes a low single-digit increase in brand marketing investments, and our CCI-led cost savings target of approximately $85 million.Based on the anticipated timing of certain items, we expect our adjusted operating profit growth to be pressured in the first quarter, accelerated in the second quarter and returned to normalized cadence of delivery for the remainder of the year. The impact of cost inflation will be weighted toward the first half of 2023, with peak inflation in the first quarter. Also, in the first quarter, we expect continued pressure to sales and profit from COVID-related disruptions in China and then the benefit beginning in the second quarter from lapping last year's impact. Additionally, the exit of our consumer business in Russia will impact the first quarter. As a reminder, we began exiting it during the second quarter of last year. Finally, related to profit timing, while we expect a minimal impact from currency rates, we project an unfavorable impact in the first half of the year and expected 3% unfavorable in the first quarter and a favorable impact in the second half of the year.We are anticipating a meaningful step-up in interest expense driven by the higher interest rate environment, which will impact our floating debt. We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 million to $210 million in 2023 and spread evenly throughout the year. As a reminder, in 2022, we realized an $18 million favorable impact from optimizing our debt portfolio, which we will lap in 2023. The net impact of these interest-related items is expected to be an 800 basis point headwind to our 2023 adjusted earnings per share growth. Our 2023 adjusted effective income tax rate is projected to be approximately 22% and based on our estimated mix of earnings by geography as well as factoring in a level of discrete impacts. Versus our 2022 adjusted effective tax rate, we expect this outlook to be a 100 basis point headwind to our 2020 earnings growth.We expect our rate to be higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. To summarize, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong underlying business growth of 8% to 10%, a 2% net favorable impact from the discrete items I just mentioned impacting profit, the global operating effectiveness program, the China recovery, the Kitchen Basics divestiture and the incentive compensation rebuild, partially offset by the combined interest and tax headwind of 9%. This results in an expected increase of 1% to 3% or a projected guidance range for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 of $2.56 to $2.61. We are projecting strong operating performance in 2023 with continued top line momentum, significant optimization of our cost structure and strong adjusted operating profit growth as well as margin expansion.While this performance is expected to be tempered by interest and tax headwinds, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and that with the execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.Lawrence Kurzius: Thank you, Mike. Now that Mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to recap the key takeaways as seen on Slide 28. Our fourth-quarter sales performance despite challenges from the COVID-related disruptions in China reflects the underlying strength of our global portfolio and the continued execution of our long-term strategies. With the stabilization of service and our supply chain in addition to positive momentum and consumption trends, we expect an acceleration in consumer segment sales dollars and volume in 2023 and continued strong flavor solutions performance as the strength of our portfolio is net with outstanding demand across our customer base. We have strong growth programs, and we look forward to sharing them at CAGNY.We are committed to increasing our profit realization. The actions we have underway to normalize our supply chain costs and increase our organizational effectiveness and efficiency are already yielding results. Our global operating effectiveness program is expected to deliver $125 million of cost savings. We expect the benefits of the program to scale up through each quarter of 2023 and continue to be accretive into 2024. While actively responding to the macroeconomic challenges we are facing, we continue to operate with the same discipline and commitment to execution as we have in any other operating environment. The fundamentals that have driven our historical performance remain in place, and we are as diligent as ever in driving value for our employees, consumers, customers and shareholders in both 2023 and beyond.The compelling benefits of our relentless focus on growth, performance and people continues to position McCormick to drive sales growth. This, coupled with our focus on recovering cost inflation and lowering costs to expand margins will allow us to realize long-term sustainable earnings growth. Before turning to your questions, I want to reiterate my confidence and driving the profitable growth reflected in our 2023 outlook. And now for your questions.See also 14 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold and 10 Best Vanguard ETFs for Diversification.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Consider United (UAL),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-fast-paced-momentum-stock-135001836.html,1674827401,STORY,['UAL'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and United Airlines (UAL) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 30.4% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this airline well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. UAL meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 20.8% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for UAL is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.35. This indicates that the stock moves 35% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that UAL has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped UAL earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, UAL is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. UAL is currently trading at 0.36 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 36 cents for each dollar of sales.So, UAL appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to UAL, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

BXP is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 results on Jan 31, after market close. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in both funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues.In the last reported quarter, this office real-estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 2.14% in terms of FFO per share. BXP’s performance during the quarter reflected healthy leasing activity and bottom-line growth.Over the preceding four quarters, Boston Properties’ FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on each occasion, the average beat being 3.39%. This is depicted in the graph below:Boston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Properties, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Properties, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Boston Properties, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayPer a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the U.S. office market has been experiencing a decline in demand for office space, with overall office absorption negative in each quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter marked the 10th quarter in the past 11, wherein the overall office absorption was negative. Moreover, with remote and hybrid work systems, office space per office worker has been shrinking.The overall gross leasing activity declined for two consecutive quarters after hitting 387 million square feet (msf) in second-quarter 2022. The same for the four quarters ending fourth-quarter 2022 was recorded at 339 msf.The national vacancy, too, soared to historical highs driven by occupiers placing oversubscribed space on the sublease market. It rose 140 basis points year over year to 18.2%. The national asking rent came in at $37.38 for the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, per the Cushman &amp; Wakefield report, gross leasing for 2022 was 5% above the 20-year historical average, implying that the leasing market remains very active despite businesses continuing to downsize.Boston Properties’ portfolio of modern, class A office buildings is likely to have benefited from the flight-to-quality preference of office tenants. This makes us optimistic about BXP’s fourth-quarter results.Also, BXP’s life-science assets are anticipated to have witnessed solid demand during the quarter on the back of the growing need for drug research and innovation.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $732.9 million, suggesting growth of 6.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reading. Also, the consensus estimate for quarterly parking and other revenues is pegged at $28.02 million, implying a 21.4% increase from the year-ago period’s reported number.In the December quarter, BXP disposed of The Avant at Reston Town Center in Reston, VA, for $141 million. This move was part of the company’s capital-reallocation strategy focused on expanding into the growing Seattle market. The sellout completed the exchange in connection with the $730 million acquisition of Madison Centre in Seattle.Such efforts highlight the company’s prudent capital management practices and relieve the pressure off its balance sheet.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been revised marginally upward to $1.84 over the past week. Moreover, the same suggests an 18.7% increase from the prior-year period’s reported number.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has been unchanged at $7.51 over the past month. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a 14.5% increase year over year on revenues of $2.91 billion.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Boston Properties this time. The right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — increases the odds of a beat.

That's up from 29% in 2021. Now, consumer spending has remained strong despite fears of a recession. That is clearly evident in the Q4 earnings report that we just got from American Express.Amex cardholders are spending 24% more at restaurants than they were a year ago. Spend on lodging and airlines both seeing double-digit growth. Shares of Amex moving to the upside today-- big pop that we saw in shares, up nearly 11%. Joining us now is Bob Napoli, he's the William Blair Co-Group Head of Financial Services and Technology.Bob, it's great to see you here. So you have an outperform rating on American Express. We've gotten Visa and Mastercard also this week. You have an outperform rating on those as well. We've all been very concerned about a slowdown, about consumers pulling back. Are those fears clearly overblown because of these results?BOB NAPOLI: Well, again, the concerns are overblown because the consumer is under leveraged and they have jobs. And generally, when you have low consumer debt as a percentage of their income and they're employed, they're going to keep spending. So I think the fears of a bad recession are overblown.JARED BLIKRE: And just thinking about some of their key initiatives, especially with respect to their premium offerings, how does that affect the changes that have really happened to some of their user-- just to society overall, and travel habits, spending habits, saving habits that have changed over the last few years? How are their premium initiatives attacking that?BOB NAPOLI: Well, their premium initiatives-- they've added-- I guess they're targeting a higher percentage of younger-- 60% of new card members this year. They added a record amount of new card members, up more than 10% this year. 60% of those are millennials and Gen Zs.Story continuesAnd millennials and Gen Zs are really good at knowing how to use those rewards. And Amex has targeted things like Netflix, and gyms, and travel rewards to those younger consumers. Now, the rebound in travel certainly has been good for American Express as well.But they've developed those cards. I mean, those consumers are-- they're paying fees. I mean, American Express card isn't cheap. They pay a good annual fee. But they give you the rewards and high quality service that makes people willing to pay those fees.SEANA SMITH: Bob, when you take a look at these numbers from Amex, clearly, cardholders spending more on experiences-- spending was up 24%-- or they increased spending by 24% at restaurants than they did a year ago, clearly spending more on travel like you're saying. Do you see that spending pattern, those trends changing at all over the next couple of months as consumers maybe do brace for some sort of a slowdown?BOB NAPOLI: Well, you're going to see you're going to have tougher comps. So you're going to get more gradual increases in spending. I mean, the growing almost 30% revenue, that's not a sustainable level. I think double-digit revenue growth for Visa, Mastercard, for the payment space is sustainable.But you are going to see, as we lap those easier-- those tougher comps because of the rebound in COVID, you are seeing in the first quarter-- actually, you've seen really strong spending coming out of the gate in the month of January. Some of that is due to a year ago, we had Omicron.But spending continues to be strong. If we do get a bad recession, yeah, you'll see a pullback in consumer spending. I think where Amex is at the high end, you'll probably see less. But also, you still have more to go in international. I mean, China just reopened. Japan reopened in October.You saw a 50% increase in spending-- travel spending in Japan. China is the biggest travel market in the world. And you're going to see-- I mean that's going to be gradual over the course of this year where you'll see the rebound in China, which will carry over into Asia, which hasn't rebounded yet.So there's still more to go on the travel side. The consumer is employed. I mean, the Fed, I think a couple more rate increases and they're most likely done. So I think we're in a good place. The potential for a soft landing, I think, has increased.JARED BLIKRE: And I want to ask you-- a lot of companies talking about the strong dollar now. American Express has unique exposure to foreign currency. And I believe, at least historically, that has really benefited them whenever they have to change some of these money from dollars into euros, vice versa. How is that dynamic playing out with the currency-- with the volatility that we've seen in the dollar over the last year?BOB NAPOLI: Well, the volatility in currency-- actually, I think Visa and Mastercard probably benefit a little bit more of that. They have a higher percentage of international than Amex does. I mean the cross-border travel for Visa and Mastercard is a very, very profitable revenue stream.But the strength in the dollar is actually mixed, I would say, for those companies. But it certainly helps their earnings as you translate the foreign earnings into US dollars, they're worth more as the dollar weakens. But I do see some slowdown in some of the benefits on foreign exchange volatility for Visa, Mastercard. I see all three benefiting from the weaker dollar.SEANA SMITH: So, Bob, you have an outperform rating on all three. Clearly, you are bullish about what we could see over the next 12 months. If you had to pick one of those names, which one is positioned best?BOB NAPOLI: Well, the one that is the best stock to own and our top pick for this year is American Express. And the reason for that is that it's trading at a 50% discount to Visa, Mastercard. Visa, Mastercard are some of the best franchises in the world with the biggest-- with very large moats. But Amex is right there with them.And should it trade at a discount? Yes. A 50% discount is ridiculous. A discount to the S&amp;P 500 when Amex fundamentally has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over any period of time that you want to look at-- 5, 10, 15, 20 years-- you know, Amex is just not getting the respect it should. Sure, it's getting a little more today, but it's still only at 13 times next year's earnings. This stock should trade at 17 times an S&amp;P multiple, at least-- probably a premium to the S&amp;P.JARED BLIKRE: No respect-- a Rodney Dangerfield joke.BOB NAPOLI: Exactly.JARED BLIKRE: From back in the day, that's what came to mind there. Thank you. Great insights as always. Bob Napoli.]"

What’s next? Who knows. I’ll still be skiing, I’ll still be around.”Goepper was part of a historic U.S. medals sweep in men’s ski slopestyle’s Olympic debut in 2014 in Russia. He went in as the favorite and ended up with bronze behind Joss Christensen and Gus Kenworthy. All three have now retired.A month before the 2018 Olympics, Goepper began revealing in interviews that he dealt with depression, a drinking problem and suicidal thoughts in 2014 and 2015.“He called one night, and he said, ‘Mom, I’m thinking about going to get a bottle of vodka and go sit in my car in Lambs Canyon [Utah] and drink the whole thing,’” his mom, Linda, said in a 2018 X Games interview. “Lambs Canyon was where another skier had committed suicide [2010 Olympic aerials silver medalist Jeret “Speedy” Peterson in 2011]. I knew that Nick was in trouble.”He spent two months in rehab in fall 2015.He returned to take Olympic silver in PyeongChang, jumping from eighth place after the second of three runs.After winning his men’s ski slopestyle record-breaking fourth and final X Games Aspen title in 2021, Goepper took another Olympic silver last year behind countryman Alex Hall.“[Winning three Olympic medals] is something I never dreamed of,” Goepper, who was 17 when the IOC added slopestyle to the Olympic program in 2011, said after last year’s medal. “If you asked me as a 16-year-old if this is what would be happening right now, I would tell you that you’re crazy.”Goepper, from the small farming town of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, sold candy bars and mowed lawns to pay for ski passes at a nearby resort (“a glorified bunny hill”), a determination that eventually led to major corporate sponsorships.Story continuesOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME), crossed party lines to vote in favor.While the bill has little chance of being considered by the Senate and even less chance of reaching President Biden’s desk, the measure put the issue of SPR management at the top of Washington’s agenda for at least two days as the reserve sits at its lowest level since 1983.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) kicked off the debate Thursday, saying the bill was necessary to “ensure this vital American energy asset — and American security interests — will not be drained away for non-emergency, political purposes.”Under the bill, other than during an emergency situation, a president wouldn’t be able to tap the reserve unless it simultaneously released a plan to increase oil production in the U.S.Meanwhile, Democrats stood largely unified in opposition with Democratic Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) releasing a statement immediately after the vote, saying it was called at the behest of oil companies and it would “raise gas prices and impede the President’s ability to continue lowering costs at the pump for working families.“Private security contractors patrol the U.S. Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Bryan Mound, Texas May 20, 2008. (REUTERS/Donna W. Carson)'An effort to attack the president'Numerous amendments were considered from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) offered an idea to ban offshore drilling in her home state, but dismissed the overall process in an interview.“The whole conversation starts in this place that I think is rather cynical and just an effort to attack the president,"" she said. Still, she acknowledged there is some value in discussing the SPR overall, but suggested little would come of it.Story continues“I don't know that that's the most pressing conversation to have,” she said.The Biden administration made its first big withdrawal from the SPR in November 2021 of 50 million barrels in response to high gas prices. It followed up with over 180 million barrels over the course of 2022 in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. Those were in addition to other scheduled regular withdrawals and cycling of the SPR.Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) has taken over the influential House House Energy and Commerce Commitee. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Supporters of the administration's strategy say the moves in 2022 were crucial to reducing gas prices by over $1.50 a gallon in recent months. The national average for gas prices sits at about $3.50 per gallon, with some observers expecting the price to rise in the coming months possibly to over $4 a gallon as demand picks up in the spring.Last month, the administration announced plans to begin replenishing the reserve, but rejected some initial offers because of pricing, with crude oil around $80/barrel.Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters on Monday she is not worried about reaching the administration’s goal of buying 60 million barrels in the coming months, teasing an announcement that she promised “very soon.” Granholm added that Biden would veto the House GOP bill in the unlikely event it reaches his desk.This week’s vote follows a Jan. 12 vote around the SPR and China, which received wide bipartisan backing, a feat that was not repeated this week.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

Fundamentally, dividend-paying enterprises offer tremendous relevancies because they help keep your portfolio right side up. And because of last year’s downpour, investors can scoop up quality names for cheap.Moving forward, it’s possible that the Federal Reserve could ease off its monetary tightening policy or perhaps slash interest rates. Such an action would likely spark upside mobility in risk-on asset classes, thereby rewarding growth-oriented enterprises. However, this projection isn’t guaranteed, which is why undervalued income stocks to buy remain intriguing.Besides, hurtling toward another ambiguous environment, anything can happen.

For instance, one of the hot topics – that’s actually a downer – in the economy right now is mass layoffs. With many high-paying white-collar jobs suffering the corporate axe, the resumes will start flying. Invariably, in my view, this circumstance should benefit the employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI).To be sure, RHI hasn’t enjoyed a great performance in the market. In the trailing year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Nevertheless, it’s one of the undervalued income stocks to buy. Again, the fundamental backdrop favors Robert Half. Increasingly, we may see rising desperation among white-collar workers, thus driving demand for the company’s services.Story continuesFinancially, the market prices RHI at nearly 13 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 15.8 times. As well, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics and a decently stable balance sheet. Though Robert Half’s forward yield of 2.16% isn’t anything to write home about, it’s also a very dependable payout.AFLAC (AFL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA specialist in the field of supplemental insurance, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) represents a boring business. Still, boring businesses tend to make solid candidates for undervalued income stocks to buy. Moreover, the wild events of the coronavirus pandemic will likely support rising demand for Aflac’s protective solutions.Essentially, the Covid-19 crisis forced Americans (and citizens of other privileged nations) to pop their delusional bubbles. No longer will once-in-a-century pandemics remain the exclusive domain of the foreign and exotic. Instead, Covid-19 made us all realize that the smelly stuff can roll downhill very quickly. And while we can’t do much about random catastrophes, we can protect ourselves financially.Aside from a great story, AFL objectively ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices Aflac shares at a trailing multiple of 9.13. For comparison, the sector median stands at 12.83 times.Finally, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.35%. No, it’s not the most generous yield but it’s a reliable payout. Indeed, the company features 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Snap-on (SNA)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAnother arguably boring idea, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) probably doesn’t get much airtime. However, that could change soon. With the Biden administration focused on repairing and revamping the nation’s various infrastructure networks, Snap-on could soar in relevance. Per the company’s public profile, it manufactures and markets high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry.While so many publicly traded securities stumbled in 2022, SNA did largely the opposite. In the trailing year, Snap-on gained over 13% of equity value. Further, in the company’s most recent third-quarter earnings report, it topped earnings and revenue estimates. Interestingly, analysts rate SNA a consensus moderate buy. And their average price target implies an upside potential of over 15%.Currently, the market prices SNA at both a trailing and forward multiple of 14.5. For both metrics, Snap-on trades conspicuously below the sector median multiple. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 2.71%. Thus, from a relevancy and dividend standpoint, SNA represents one of the undervalued income stocks to buy in January.United Microelectronics (UMC)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockDue to the severe global supply chain disruption impacting the broader technology space, it’s no surprise that semiconductor firm United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) suffered steep losses in 2022. In the trailing year, UMC gave up nearly 27% of equity value. That said, modern societies always move forward. Therefore, UMC could make for an interesting pickup among undervalued income stocks to buy.Indeed, the rest of the markets seem to think so. Since the January opener, UMC stormed out of the gates to a nearly 21% upside performance. Currently, Wall Street analysts rate United as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target implies a 24% upside potential from here on out. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, UMC also enjoys very positive sentiment among hedge funds.As well, the market prices shares at 9.7-times forward earnings, well below the sector median of 18.6 times. Further, United benefits from a strong balance sheet and excellent profit margins. Its forward yield of 3.59% represents the icing on the cake. It’s easily one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockArguably, when most people look for ideas to invest in, manufacturers of power tools don’t come readily to mind. However, with the aforementioned Biden administration pushing its infrastructure-building initiatives, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) could enjoy upside success. Notably, analysts from Data Bridge Market Research project that the power tools market could reach a valuation of $51.45 billion. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2021.To be fair, the market hasn’t been friendly to SWK. In the trailing year, shares plunged more than 50%, which is horrendous, needless to say. However, investors appear to see incredible value in SWK now. Since the January opener, the underlying company gained over 16% of market value. To add more encouragement, hedge fund sentiment for the power tools specialist ranks as very positive.Right now, the market prices SWK at a trailing multiple of 9.7. This compares quite favorably against the sector median of 20.6 times. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 3.62%, making it one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAlthough I’m starting to go back to the well a bit too many times with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), if you’re seeking undervalued income stocks to buy, it’s probably one of the best for more aggressive investors. Fundamentally, what’s attractive about the company centers on its downstream component of the energy value chain. Focusing on refining and marketing, it’s directly connected to where the economic rubber meets the road.In my estimation, there will be plenty of rubber meeting the same congested road soon. With major enterprises now demanding their remote workers to come back to the office, oil firms must be licking their lips. While worker bees might put up a fuss, under a recessionary environment, it’s wise to just toe the line. Otherwise, you could be on the unemployment line.Objectively, PSX ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy based on its trailing multiple. Presently, the market prices shares at 4.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median pings at 8.4 times. With a forward yield of 3.63%, it’s very difficult to ignore Phillips 66.British American Tobacco (BTI)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockSaving the most controversial name on this list of undervalued income stocks to buy, agnostically-minded investors may want to consider British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI). Politically, socially and ideologically, the tobacco industry commands as much respect as a dental practice with no anesthesia. Still, British American is evolving with the market, particularly with its cleaner-profile vaping/e-cigarette products.Cynically, it’s also possible that the associated mental health pressures stemming from a recession may lead to an increased usage of adult liberties. I’m not just talking about “analog” cigarettes but also the increased use of vaping products. Based on the available evidence, vaping is less harmful than smoking but it’s not 100% safe.On the financial front, BTI makes a case for undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.72. In contrast, the sector median stands at 12.2 times. Finally, British American offers a forward yield of 7.76%.

Fundamentally, dividend-paying enterprises offer tremendous relevancies because they help keep your portfolio right side up. And because of last year’s downpour, investors can scoop up quality names for cheap.Moving forward, it’s possible that the Federal Reserve could ease off its monetary tightening policy or perhaps slash interest rates. Such an action would likely spark upside mobility in risk-on asset classes, thereby rewarding growth-oriented enterprises. However, this projection isn’t guaranteed, which is why undervalued income stocks to buy remain intriguing.Besides, hurtling toward another ambiguous environment, anything can happen. You can mitigate some of the unpleasantries with the undervalued income stocks to buy listed below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRHIRobert Half$79.24AFLAFLAC$72.68SNASnap-on$241.17UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.84SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$87.69PSXPhillips 66$106.95BTIBritish American Tobacco$38.22Robert Half (RHI)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comUnder strained market environments such as the present juncture, you must take what Wall Street gives you. For instance, one of the hot topics – that’s actually a downer – in the economy right now is mass layoffs. With many high-paying white-collar jobs suffering the corporate axe, the resumes will start flying. Invariably, in my view, this circumstance should benefit the employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI).To be sure, RHI hasn’t enjoyed a great performance in the market. In the trailing year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Nevertheless, it’s one of the undervalued income stocks to buy. Again, the fundamental backdrop favors Robert Half. Increasingly, we may see rising desperation among white-collar workers, thus driving demand for the company’s services.Story continuesFinancially, the market prices RHI at nearly 13 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 15.8 times. As well, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics and a decently stable balance sheet. Though Robert Half’s forward yield of 2.16% isn’t anything to write home about, it’s also a very dependable payout.AFLAC (AFL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA specialist in the field of supplemental insurance, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) represents a boring business. Still, boring businesses tend to make solid candidates for undervalued income stocks to buy. Moreover, the wild events of the coronavirus pandemic will likely support rising demand for Aflac’s protective solutions.Essentially, the Covid-19 crisis forced Americans (and citizens of other privileged nations) to pop their delusional bubbles. No longer will once-in-a-century pandemics remain the exclusive domain of the foreign and exotic. Instead, Covid-19 made us all realize that the smelly stuff can roll downhill very quickly. And while we can’t do much about random catastrophes, we can protect ourselves financially.Aside from a great story, AFL objectively ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices Aflac shares at a trailing multiple of 9.13. For comparison, the sector median stands at 12.83 times.Finally, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.35%. No, it’s not the most generous yield but it’s a reliable payout.

235,6b9b035c-4844-320a-84ad-cb17338606fa,NVDA,2023-01-28,NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock performs better than its underlying earnings growth over last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-stock-performs-110107794.html,1674903667,STORY,['NVDA'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) share price has soared 249% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 47% in about a quarter.On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, NVIDIA achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 17% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 28% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 84.13.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that NVIDIA has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, NVIDIA's TSR for the last 5 years was 252%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 7.7% in the twelve months, NVIDIA shareholders did even worse, losing 11% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 29% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NVIDIA better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  NVIDIA is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 27.6% gain over the past four weeks.Amtech Systems extended its rally, driven by its winning production-scale projects. Further, solid momentum across various applications such as Silicon Carbide wafer polishing, thermal processing for EV sensors, power module substrates and battery cooling assemblies, remains a positive. Additionally, the company’s recent acquisition of Entrepix remains noteworthy.This provider of equipment for solar panel and semiconductor makers is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -257.1%. Revenues are expected to be $21 million, down 23.2% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Amtech, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on ASYS going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The metric also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8%.The adjustments include certain non-recurring expenses/benefits like amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related expenses, among others.GAAP EPS in the reported quarter was $1.53, up 11.7% from the year-ago quarter’s EPS.RevenuesFiscal second-quarter revenues on a reported basis increased 16% year over year (up 20% at the constant exchange rate or CER) to $1.03 billion. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.6%.A Closer View of the Q2 Top LineTotal Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues improved 15% (up 20% at CER) from the prior-year period to $917 million.Total Sleep and Respiratory Care revenues in Europe, Asia and other markets fell 16% on a reported basis and 6% at CER to $266.3 million.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseResMed Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseResMed Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | ResMed Inc. QuoteMeanwhile, Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues grew 9% to $116.8 million (up 20% at CER).The revenue growth in the quarter was backed by increased demand for the company’s sleep products across its portfolio and ongoing device demand generated by ResMed’s competitors' product recall. Year-on-year movements in foreign exchange, in particular, a weaker euro, negatively impacted revenues by approximately $36 million in the reported quarter.MarginsAdjusted gross profit in the quarter under review rose 13.9% to $587 million, despite a 17.8% uptick in the cost of sales (excluding expenses related to amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring). However, the adjusted gross margin for the fiscal second quarter was 56.9%, reflecting an 83-basis point (bps) contraction.Story continuesThe decrease was predominantly attributable to an unfavorable product mix due to increased flow generator sales as well as unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 14.2% year over year to $211.7 million. Research and development expenses increased 11.8% to $69.9 million.Adjusted operating income was $305.5 million in the quarter under discussion, up 14.1% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin however contracted 36 bps year over year to 29.6%.Financial UpdatesResMed exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $253.2 million, compared with $207.2 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Total debt (short and long-term) at the end of the fiscal second quarter was 1.80 billion, compared with $795.2 million at the end of the fiscal first quarter.The cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the fiscal second quarter was $128.6 million, compared with $219.9 million in the year-ago period.   The company paid out $64.5 million as dividends during the fiscal second quarter.Our TakeResMed exited the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company recorded a robust sales performance in the quarter on increased demand for sleep and respiratory care devices. Mask sales growth was strong across the globe, reflecting a post-COVID pandemic awareness about the importance and need for respiratory hygiene and respiratory health.The company registered strong customer uptake of the re-engineered AirSense 10 Card-to-Cloud device.However, the FX headwind negatively impacted revenues by approximately $36 million in the reported quarter.The contraction of the gross operating margin as a result of escalating expenses is discouraging. The persistent supply chain constraints in a challenging freight environment are hampering ResMed’s ability to meet the growing device demand.Zacks Rank and Upcoming ReleasesResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The same for revenues stands at $70.48 billion, indicating an increase of 2.7% from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteMcKesson’s fiscal third-quarter performance are expected to reflect segmental strength.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment might have acted as a key growth driver in the quarter to be reported. The consensus mark for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $61.7 billion, indicating an improvement of 12.1% from the prior-year quarter.The segment is likely to have benefited from market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers in the to-be-reported quarter. However, branded-to-generic conversions might have weighed on the segment’s performance. Nevertheless, the company’s broad spectrum of specialty biopharmaceutical providers and manufacturers is likely to have contributed to the fiscal third-quarter performance.Growth and improvement in the primary care business and contribution from kitting, storage, and distribution of ancillary supplies to the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program are likely to have positively impacted the company’s Medical-Surgical Solutions segment.McKesson’s collaboration with the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine distribution effort highlighted the company’s role in the COVID-19 response.

Robinson Worldwide CHRW is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 1, after market close.CHRW has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 12.08%.C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseC.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. price-eps-surprise | C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for C.H. Robinson this earnings season.Q4 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for C.H. Robinson’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $5.60 billion, indicating 13.84% decline year over year. The top line is likely to have been weighed down by the lower ocean and air pricing.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for North American Surface Transportation’s revenues is pegged at $3,768 million, indicating a 3.3% decrease from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Forwarding revenues is pegged at $1,437 million, indicating a 32.9% decline from the year-ago reported figure. The downside is likely to have been caused by lower pricing and volumes in CHRW’s ocean and air services.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for All Other and Corporate (Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and Other Surface Transportation) revenues is pegged at $473 million, indicating 2.4% growth from the year-ago reported figure.However, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to a rise in personnel expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, might have dented C.H. Robinson’s bottom line in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CHRW’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 27% in the past 90 days.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for C.H. Robinson this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesC.H. Robinson has an Earnings ESP of -1.60% and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q3C.H. Robinson’s third-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.78 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15 and declined 3.8% year over year. Total revenues of $6,015.4 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,368.2 million and declined 4% year over year. The year-over-year downfall was due to the lower ocean and air pricing, partially offset by higher pricing in less-than-truckload and truckload revenues.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings:Lyft, Inc. LYFT has an Earnings ESP of +42.37% and a Zacks Rank #2.

249,201d330a-9dde-3ce5-8a8d-2266058eb575,DIS,2023-01-28,What Is The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) Share Price Doing?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-companys-nyse-dis-120023930.html,1674907223,STORY,['DIS'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Walt Disney’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Walt Disney is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $144.75, but it is currently trading at US$110 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Walt Disney’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Walt Disney look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Walt Disney. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since DIS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DIS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DIS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

This is the company's first gasoline price increase since June, though diesel prices will remain stable. The new price for gasoline will be 3.31 reais, which is equivalent to 63.91 cents.The announcement came even as the company’s next CEO, Jean Paul Prates — who was selected by the newly elected Brazilian President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva — previously stated that he does not plan to fully disconnect Petrobras' fuel prices from international market prices, but instead aims to ""unlink them from import parity."" This means that the prices may still be influenced by global market conditions, but will not be directly tied to the cost of importing fuel into Brazil.The company currently sets the fuel prices in the local market based on international rates, including the foreign exchange rate and global crude oil prices. This means that the company's fuel prices will change in response to changes in the international market, rather than being set by the import parity.Investors should know that pricing policy is a sensitive issue for the company, which caused the ouster of three CEOs during the term of the previous President, Jair Bolsonaro, after an increase in fuel prices stoked voter frustration in an election year.Zacks Rank and Key PicksHeadquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras S.A., is the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America.Currently, Petroleo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 7.1%.Woodward reported adjusted net earnings of 84 cents per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which increased 2.4% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales moved up 12% year over year to $640 million due to higher sales in the Aerospace and Industrial segment. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.2%.Factors to NoteThe company’s performance in the fiscal first quarter is likely to have benefited from strong demand in both business segments.Aerospace segment is expected to have benefited from higher commercial OEM and aftermarket sales resulting from improving passenger traffic and aircraft utilization along with higher OEM production rates.The company expects the power generation market to pick up pace, owing to rising demand for industrial turbo machinery especially in Asia and backup power at data centers. The segment is also likely to have gained from momentum in the global marine market due to increasing ship building rates and higher utilization.However, weakness in defense OEM and aftermarket sales due to lower guided weapons sales is likely to act as a headwind along with depressed natural gas truck production in China.  Global macroeconomic weakness, forex volatility and persistent supply-chain disruptions continue to remain major concerns.Woodward, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 8 cents per share, against the earnings of $2.30 per share reported in the prior-year quarter.Western Digital expects non-GAAP revenues between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.01 billion, indicating a decline of 37.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing once. It has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 3.1%, on average. In the past year, shares of WDC have lost 12.3% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s decline of 15.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to Note Ahead of Q2 ReleaseWestern Digital’s fiscal second quarter performance is likely to have been affected by weakening consumer demand owing to prevailing global macroeconomic uncertainties and rising inflation. Apart from inventory corrections by consumers, persistent supply-chain troubles and economic slowdown in China related to COVID-19 continue to remain headwinds.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in fourth-quarter calendar-year 2022 are likely to have negatively impacted hard disk drive (HDD) sales resulting in affecting the company’s performance in the quarter under review. Higher costs associated with ramping up next-generation energy-assisted hard drives amid stiff competition in the disk-drive market might have dented fiscal second quarter profits.To battle macroeconomic uncertainties, WDC is focused on reducing capital investments and operating expenses to better align cash flow and cost structure with market conditions.Coming to the product group, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flash revenues is pegged at $1.337 billion. Flash demand is under pressure due to inventory reduction at PC OEMs and lower flash pricing. The ramp-up of new 5G phones incorporating the company’s latest BiCS5 flash solutions and strength in the company’s SanDisk and WD Black product lines bode well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second quarter HDD revenues is pegged at $1.693 billion. HDD revenues are expected to have been negatively impacted by decline in demand in other capacity enterprise product channels. However, the adoption of SMR hard drives (especially 17 terabyte per capacity enterprise drive and 20-terabyte drive exabyte shipments) remains healthy and is likely to have cushioned the segment’s performance.Story continuesWestern Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseWestern Digital Corporation price-eps-surprise | Western Digital Corporation Quote What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Western Digital this time around.

This compares to earnings of $0.79 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this consumer products maker would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Colgate-Palmolive , which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, posted revenues of $4.63 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.21%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.4 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Colgate-Palmolive shares have lost about 4.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.8%.What's Next for Colgate-Palmolive?While Colgate-Palmolive has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Colgate-Palmolive: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

273,46132357-8eca-3fd1-8682-33e18cbb5e82,DVN,2023-01-28,Investors Heavily Search Devon Energy Corporation (DVN): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-devon-energy-140002111.html,1674828002,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +7.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +31.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +139.1%. This estimate has changed -8.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.04 indicates a change of -4.7% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -10.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.78 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $19.83 billion and $18.76 billion estimates indicate +66.4% and -5.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) share price has flown 220% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 40% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results, released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.Since it's been a strong week for United Rentals shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. View our latest analysis for United Rentals There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, United Rentals achieved compound earnings per share growth of 26% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 47% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on United Rentals' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that United Rentals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 37% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 20% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for United Rentals  that you should be aware of.Story continuesThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

Speaking today for United Rentals is Matt Flannery, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ted Grace, Chief Financial Officer.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Flannery. Mr. Flannery, you may begin.Matt Flannery: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Yesterday we reported record fourth quarter results to cap the best full-year financial performance in our history. And we definitely raised the bar in 2022 and we intend to raise it again in 2023. We're moving forward with a larger sales and service team, a more expansive footprint and a fleet that's significantly larger than a year ago, and that's a lot of tailwind at our back in another year of high demand. And I'll start with a recap of fourth quarter results, which kept us on a strong trajectory. We grew both rental revenue and total revenue by a solid 19% compared with fourth quarter last year. And we grew adjusted EBITDA by 26% with a 280 basis point improvement in margin, and that brought our margin to 50% in the quarter, and that came in at a very strong flow through of 65%.Story continuesWe also continued to generate significant cash. For the full year, we delivered $1.76 billion of free cash flow, and that's after investing over $3.4 billion in fleet. And none of this would have been possible without our people. First off, as you know, our top priority is always safety. And our team delivered another first-class recordable rate in 2022 in a year when we onboarded over 6,000 new employees. On the financial side, you can look at every metric I just mentioned and see the quality of Team United behind the result. For example, our revenue growth comes from keeping our customers front and center in the field. Our people are laser-focused on helping our customers succeed. And our flow-through comes from the team's ability to leverage our growth and maintain good cost discipline.Inflation was a factor, but that didn't stop us from delivering very good margins. We also reported a record return on invested capital of 12.7% at year-end. And on the ESG front, we made good progress with sustainability, including new investments in zero-emission vehicles and fleet. And the customer adoption of our new emissions tracking tool has been excellent. This is the technology we launched on our total control platform, and it's an industry first. Another highlight of the quarter was the Ahern acquisition, and I'm pleased to say the integration is going very well. We closed the deal on December 7. And then by the 16th, our new team members were already operating with the rest of the company on the same technology system. And this means our branches are sharing fleet and customer information seamlessly.One of the main reasons we like M&amp;A is the capacity we gain. And that comes in three forms: people, fleet and facilities. And we always focus on the people first, because it's critical to get that right. And we're really bullish about the talent we onboarded in this acquisition. We had over 100 of the Ahern managers at our Annual Meeting earlier this month, and they fit like a hand in glove. And they're excited to be part of United and they're raring to go. Now we're focused on optimizing the fleet and facilities. We're running on schedule, and it's boosting our resources at an ideal time to capture share. The diversity of demand that we pointed to a year ago turned out to be a major tailwind in our operating environment, and that continues to be true.And I'll share some fourth quarter data to underscore how we translated this opportunity into top-line growth. Demand in our key verticals was broad-based, with total construction up 19% year-over-year and non-res up 22%; and industrial, up 11%. We leaned into that opportunity across the board and grew rental revenue by solid double digits in all of our gen rent regions as well as all of our specialty businesses. Our specialty segment delivered another strong performance with an 18% increase in rental revenue year-over-year. And it's notable that every line of business in that segment reported solid gain led by our mobile storage business. Our greenfield investments in specialty are highly strategic and they're targeted by geography and line of business to generate attractive returns.And we opened 35 of these locations in the past 12 months, and our plan calls for at least another 40 cold starts in 2023. So that brings us to 2023. So there are plenty of reasons to feel confident about our operating environment. We have terrific internal and external momentum with good visibility into revenue. And the team's done a great job of driving strong fleet productivity to help offset the cost inflation we've experienced. Contractor backlogs are growing, and not surprisingly, the employment reports indicate that U.S. contractors continue to be in expansion mode. Industry indicators like Dodge Momentum Index show healthy growth trends in commercial construction, and this includes the planning trends for future projects. There's also a strong institutional component to the trends which we see in our business.And a number of our multi-year projects are in sectors like healthcare and education. And the industrial indicators like the PMI still have room for improvement. But the construction activity and manufacturing's going strong. We're winning business on a wide range of new plant construction including automotive and batteries, semiconductors and petrochem. And importantly, our own survey shows that customer sentiment remains strong with the majority of our customers point to growth over the next 12 months. One final indicator of market strength and an important one was at our annual management meeting. We had over 2,000 field leaders with us in Houston two weeks ago, and their take was extremely positive. And I'm throwing that into the mix because this is coming directly from people on the front lines.We took all this into consideration when we developed our 2023 guidance. And as you saw yesterday, we expect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA to hit new high water marks, including free cash flow of more than $2.1 billion, while our return on invested capital should be another milestone for us. In addition to the capacity we carried into January, we plan to invest more than $3.4 billion in gross CapEx this year. And at the same time, we'll continue to take advantage of a strong used equipment market to optimize our fleet. Longer-term outlook for our industry continues to be very favorable driven by several tailwinds that we believe are largely independent of macro conditions. And we've talked about these before, things like infrastructure spending, the Inflation Reduction Act and the return of manufacturing to North America as well as investments in both energy and power.Now, before I wrap up, I want to mention two important announcements we made yesterday regarding capital allocation. First off, we're reactivating the $1.25 billion share repurchase program that we pause when we announce the Ahern deal. We plan to buy back $1 billion of stock this year. And we'll also be instituting quarterly dividends for our shareholders, totaling $5.92 per share this year. These two decisions underscore our confidence in the durability of our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet. And together, they'll return $1.4 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023. So to come full circle, 2022 was a demand environment that through the door wide open for a record year and we ran with it. But to quote Babe Ruth, we also know that yesterday's home runs don't win tomorrow's games.So now it's onwards and upwards. 2023 is officially the start of the next quarter century in business for United Rentals, and by all accounts, this will be another memorable year. So with that, I'll ask Ted to cover the results and then we'll go to Q&amp;A. Ted, over to you.Ted Grace: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in the results we reported last night, the team did a great job delivering across the board, both in the quarter and for the full year. And importantly, as you can see in our guidance, we expect these trends to continue in 2023. Combined with the enhancements to our capital allocation strategy that we've announced this quarter, we are confident that we will continue to drive meaningful long-term value creation for our shareholders. I'll dig into this more in a bit, but first, let's dive into the quarter. Fourth quarter rental revenue was a record $2.74 billion. That's an increase of $435 million or nearly 19% year-over-year. Within rental revenue, OER increased by $354 million or 18.6%.Our fleet average  our average fleet size increased by 14.2%, which provided a $270 million benefit to revenue and fleet productivity increased by healthy 5.9%, which added another $113 million. This was partially offset by our usual fleet inflation of 1.5% or roughly $29 million. Also within rental, ancillary revenues were higher by $81 million or 23.1% year-over-year. While re-rent was essentially flat. Outside of rental, fourth quarter used sales increased by roughly 26% to $409 million as we sold some fleet we've held back on selling earlier in the year. To help accomplish this, we brought in our channel mix for used sales in Q4 to something closer to normalized levels. The net of this was our adjusted use margins increased by 940 basis points year-over-year to 61.6% supported by strong pricing.Let's move to EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.65 billion, another record and an increase of $338 million or 25.8% year-on-year. The dollar change included a $291 million increase from rental within, which OER contributed $256 million. Ancillary added $34 million and re-rent was up $1 million. Outside of rental, used sales added about $83 million to adjusted EBITDA, while other non-rental lines of businesses contributed another $18 million. SG&amp;A was a $54 million headwind to adjusted EBITDA due primarily to higher commissions and the continued normalization of certain discretionary costs. As a percentage of sales, however, SG&amp;A was down slightly year-over-year. Looking at fourth quarter profitability, our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 280 basis points to 50.0%.weerasak saeku/Shutterstock.comExcluding the benefit of used sales, flow-through was in line with recent quarters at a healthy 59%. I'll add that within the fourth quarter results, in the roughly three weeks we owned Ahern, the business contributed about $54 million of total revenue, the vast majority of which was rental and roughly $20 million of EBITDA. And finally, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $9.74 per share. That's an increase of $2.35 per share or almost 32% year-on-year. Turning to CapEx. Fourth quarter gross rental CapEx was $980 million, and net rental CapEx was $571 million. This represents an increase of $205 million in net CapEx year-over-year, which positions us well for the growth we see in 2023. Now, let's look at return on invested capital and free cash flow.ROIC was another highlight at a record 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis. That's up 50 basis points sequentially and an increase of 240 basis points year-on-year. Free cash flow also continues to be very strong, with the year coming in at $1.76 billion or a free cash margin of better than 15%, all while continuing to fund growth. Turning to the balance sheet. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.0 times on an as-reported basis, including the impact of the Ahern acquisition. More importantly, on a pro forma basis, our year-end leverage ratio was flat sequentially at 1.9 times. And finally, our liquidity at the end of the quarter was a very robust $2.9 billion with no long-term note maturities until 2027. Now, let's look forward and talk about our 2023 guidance.Total revenue is expected in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.2 billion, implying full year growth of about 20% at midpoint and pro forma growth of roughly 12%. This increase is supported by the momentum we've carried into the New Year, particularly within rental revenue and the contribution from Ahern. Within total revenue, I'll note that our used sales guidance is implied at $1.3 billion, with the expectation that we'll sell roughly $2 billion of OEC. This 35% increase in used sales year-over-year primarily reflects two things. First, is the normalization of our used sales as the supply chain continues to improve. And second, a substantially larger fleet, including the addition of Ahern to our business. We remain focused on efficiently converting this growth to our bottom line.Our adjusted EBITDA range is $6.6 billion to $6.85 billion. On an as-reported basis, including the impact of Ahern, at midpoint, this implies roughly flat full year adjusted EBITDA margins and flow-through of about 48%. On a pro forma basis, however, which we think is the more appropriate way to think about it, our guidance would imply at roughly 80 basis points of margin expansion and flow through in the mid-50s. On the fleet side, our initial gross CapEx guidance is $3.3 billion to $3.55 billion, with net CapEx of $2 billion to $2.25 billion. And finally, our free cash guidance is $2.1 billion to $2.35 billion. To be clear, this is before dividends and repurchases. Assuming these two factors are a use of cash of roughly $1.4 billion that leaves $825 million of remaining free cash flow to fund additional growth or reduce net debt.Now before we go to Q&amp;A, I want to make some additional comments on our updated capital allocation strategy. Specifically around our plans to return excess cash to our investors. As you heard Matt say, we are very pleased to be adding a dividend program to our mix. Based on an initial yield of 1.5%, we expect to pay $5.92 in dividends per share in 2023. This will translate to approximately $400 million this year or roughly 18% of free cash flow. We expect that our first quarterly dividend payment of $1.48 will be made on February 22, with all four payments expected within the calendar year. Following the transformation of the company over the last decade or so, we feel that it's the appropriate time to add this last element to our capital return strategy to help drive greater shareholder value.Not only will this help expand the universe of potential investors, we expect that it will also provide another means of enhancing total returns for our investors over time. It also reflects the confidence we have in our operating model to consistently generate considerable excess free cash flow after investing in growth. We're also very pleased to announce the restart of our share repurchase program, which we paused in November with the announcement of Ahern. The restart is probably a bit ahead of schedule, but the integration is off to a great start and the decision is well supported by the financial performance we expect this year. It's our intention to repurchase $1 billion of the $1.25 billion authorization in calendar 2023. As Matt said, these two programs combined, should return approximately $1.4 billion to our shareholders this year or about $20 per share at the same time that we continue to see substantial growth in our earnings.Finally, I want to be clear that these announcements are being made in the context of our continued commitment to a disciplined balance sheet strategy. Our financial strength has served the company and its shareholders very well, and we're not planning any changes there. So with that, we'll turn to Q&amp;A.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.United Rentals (URI) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this equipment rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for United Rentals is 16.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 15.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 4.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for United Rentals is 25.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 17.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 10.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for United Rentals have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made United Rentals a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions United Rentals well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

S&amp;P up just about a quarter of a percent. The NASDAQ up about 1% with tech outperforming for the majority of the week.Let's take a look at some of the day's top movers. Hasbro-- let's talk about that stock-- is tumbling today as the company reported prelim fourth-quarter results. We're looking at losses of just about 8%. Now the toymaker expecting fourth-quarter revenue, which includes that very important holiday season for this business, to fall 17% from the year prior.Now, Hasbro also signaling that the tech industry is not the only sector start far from to rebalance its workforce. The 100-year-old toy company planning to cut 15% of its global workforce. Hasbro hoping cutting those positions, a thousand positions, could save it up to $300 million annually by 2025.And, Jared, in those cuts, the president and COO is going to be leaving as well. They clearly needed to adjust their business to cut some costs. Wall Street seems to be a little bit mixed in terms of what we could expect from Hasbro over the next couple of months. Jefferies is saying it's going to be a painful period, but they're more confident that Hasbro is going to come out with higher margins, that you will be rewarded if you stick with it.On the flip, side Truist a little bit more of a negative view. They're not too optimistic that that growth is going to continue.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens with some of these companies in the retail space because the layoffs, they hit the tech space first, some of those fringe jobs. Then they hit the manufacturing space, the industrials, and then the retail takes a hit. So we'll have to see if that happens.Story continuesJust taking a look at the YFi Interactive here, I was looking at a retail screen-- we've got that up-- over the last five days. Lots of green right there, but you contrast it with the industrials. I was taking a look at them as well. Boeing doing really well, but I think it's kind of-- or excuse me, Boeing has done very well this year, but I think they're kind of an outlier giving their checkered history and their bounce back from the 737 Max disaster.DAVE BRIGGS: The news, of course, about Boeing that they, unlike Hasbro, complete opposite reaction to the economy. They are adding 10,000 workers this year. So you ask yourself, what is happening overall with the workforce in this country?Outside of tech, we haven't seen a whole lot of layoffs. That's why Hasbro raised so many eyebrows. You had 3M as well cutting 2,500. So it looked like the trend was starting to pick up, and then Boeing comes out with this massive number.They're not alone. United will hire 2,500 pilots this year. Southwest, as much struggles as they've had, they will hire this year. We just learned that Chipotle-- burrito season, which is March to May. I did not know there was a burrito season.SEANA SMITH: Me neither, and I'm excited about it.DAVE BRIGGS: They are hiring 15,000 workers. So it will be interesting as we push forward towards another jobs number next week. What are we going to see? Doesn't look like a big tick down on the unemployment rate. These layoffs have been relatively small, for the most part. In particular, Boeing's hires outweigh just about all the layoffs we've seen over the last week.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. And it will also be interesting to see whether or not some of these companies who are hiring, whether or not they'll be able to find the workers that they need or the workers that they are hoping to get, given the labor shortage.All right, elsewhere in retail, let's talk about Bed Bath &amp; Beyond because news coming out of the potential bankruptcy filing here. The stock closing up just about 1% today. Bloomberg reporting that the retailer has been unable to find a bankruptcy buyer and could be facing liquidation. Our own Brian Sozzi also reporting this afternoon that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is closing all of its Harmon brand stores.We're looking at gains today. Dave, it almost seems like the safest way to put this, bankruptcy seems imminent. It's all just a question of time at this point and what exactly it's going to look like.Without question. I think my biggest questions are more, what are they going to do with the assets? What are they going to do with the real estate? That is a massive amount of real estate across this country.I thought interesting side note. If, in fact, they do file, who will benefit from their exit? Well, the note from Oppenheimer today says Target stands in line to benefit the most from the exit. So they got a little pop from that, and I think Target could also benefit, quite frankly, if Party City has to file as well. See a little bit of their business.Jared, it looks inevitable. More a question of when, not if.JARED BLIKRE: I think so, and something surprised me. I was just looking at the YFi Interactive at our retail heat map once again. I was just showing this. I sorted by performance because Bed Bath &amp; Beyond too small to be seen. Guess what? It's positive on the year, one point-- up 1.6%, and that's after the nasty drubbing that it's taken over the last few days. Basically a penny stock, so not much more to comment on there.If they have to liquidate, it's going to be a situation that we haven't seen like-- we were talking about some analogs in the global financial crisis. I think Circuit City was a name, and there are some others there. So we'll see.]"

Davidson Sr. Research Analyst Linda Bolton Weiser joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss quarterly earnings for Hasbro and Mattel, what’s next for Hasbro’s digital gaming business, job cuts, consumer spending, and the outlook for the toy sector.Video Transcript- Hasbro announced layoffs yesterday. The Rhode-Island-based company will cut as many as 1,000 jobs. It's a sign of uncertainty, of course, outside of tech.For more on what this means for the toy sector ahead of Hasbro's fourth quarter report, let's get to DA Davidson's Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Linda Bolton Weiser. Linda, it is good to see you.So Hasbro, of course, the layoffs are only part of the story. They also gave a pretty dismal forecast for the fourth quarter. And it seems like, bottom line, they're just not selling as many toys. What's going on here?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, in fact, the toy demand in the United States is actually pretty strong. Through the first nine months, point of sale at retail was up in the low single digits against a really strong year last year.So the problem is more with inventory reductions by retailers. So when there were shortages of toys last Christmas and 2021, the retailers really stocked up a lot in the first part of 2022. And then by the time the summer rolled around and consumer demand was a little bit pinched because of inflation, then they had too much inventory.So it's not so much the health of consumers buying toys. It's more the retailer inventory reductions that has caused the low sales performance, the sales declines from the toy companies.- Linda, what role is Mattel playing in just the disappointing results over at Hasbro? Mattel has been doing better, I would say, at least the past three quarters fundamentally compared to Hasbro.LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Yeah, Mattel went through a turnaround and restructuring a few years ago and is generally in much better health right now. But Mattel is well will have down sales in the fourth quarter. So they're not immune to the retailer inventory reductions. But in general, Mattel has been healthier.Story continuesAnd, of course, Hasbro now is not really so much a toy company. 60% of Hasbro's profit comes from their Wizards and Digital Gaming business.- Is Wizards and Digital, frankly, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is that enough to really kind of be the bridge for Hasbro here?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, in the fourth quarter, their Wizards and Digital Gaming segment was actually up 22% year-over-year. So they did have a very favorable comparison. They had some launches. So it was the toy division that had the biggest decline, which was down over 25% in the quarter.- Linda, Hasbro has really been dragged on various YouTube toy channels and on social media on how it's been operating that Wizards business. Do you think they have permanently ruined it?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, no, we're still optimistic about the long-term growth of the Wizards business, which is Magic-- The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons. And they did exhibit really strong growth of over 20% in the fourth quarter, which, I think, is evidence of the long-term health of that business.- Is there a continued shift right now in kind of a consumer spending pullback, if you will, of some of those discretionary dollars? Is there more of a shift from toys to tablet? And what I mean by that is kind of this tabletop playing to playing on a tablet and digital gaming instead. And how does that impact a company in Hasbro and perhaps the broader toy segment?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, in terms of their Wizards and Digital Gaming business, in terms of that whole segment, actually, about 80% of the revenue is still tabletop. So that really shows you that Magic-- The Gathering, for example, is largely still played with actual physical cards. So that's still a very important part of it.And really little children, little infant babies don't play with tablets and electronic devices as much. And the consumption curve for toys by age has already shifted down to a very low age. That occurred 10 or 15 years ago. So that's not really a negative impact on the toy industry at this point.- Linda, what does this tell us about anything about how Mattel is going to do or is doing?LINDA BOLTON WEISER: Well, both companies, Hasbro and Mattel, had lowered their guidance previously for the fourth quarter. Mattel has announced their reporting date. And they haven't preannounced a disappointment.So we're hopeful that Mattel can actually do better. They've exhibited a lot more control over being able to forecast their financial results than Hasbro has recently. So we're optimistic they can at least come within the range, sort of, of what the Street is expecting. But that is for the declines in the fourth quarter. So it's really affecting Mattel as well. But you can see that the Mattel share price is not even down so much today because I think people recognize the difference a little bit between Hasbro and Mattel.- All right, DA Davidson Analyst Linda Bolton Weiser joining us this morning. Thanks so much. We'll see if some of the movie and entertainment content is enough to move some more of those toys as well here this year. We appreciate your time this morning.]"

Let's check in on some trending tickers right now. Hasbro definitely on our list. It's announced it will implement organizational changes. That is a euphemism, maybe, for cutting jobs. That's 15% of its workforce in order to reduce costs. The toymaker also issuing some weaker-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter.Revenue could fall 17-- as much as 17%. And the company said, fourth-quarter earnings will be $1.29 to $1.31. That is way below the $1.49 that analysts had been estimating. So not good, Brian Sozzi.BRIAN SOZZI: Not good. And I think back-- I did my take on Hasbro. They did an Investor Day a couple of months ago and put out really these outlandish longer term guidance ranges, which I said at the time looked completely foolish. And they look even more foolish today in the context of seeing fourth-quarter sales down 17% year-over-year.And I talked to a couple of investors in Hasbro. And they're just very disappointed by the execution at the company. They're waiting for some of these cost cuts that Hasbro has promised to really start to flow through to the bottom line. That has not happened yet.And you-- this notion that toys, I think, are recession proof could be tossed right in the trash. Brad, I went to Target the final few days ahead of Christmas, and a lot of Hasbro's board games were collecting dust on their shelves.BRAD SMITH: Look, I'm gonna look at one of the bright spots here, ""D&amp;D."" A lot of ""D&amp;D,"" ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" fans out there can be very pleased that Hasbro is saying this is still going to be a bright spot. It's also a big year for ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons,"" got a new motion picture coming out.And we know how well many of these action figures and toys will do off the back of a motion picture. I believe that drops actually sometime soon, March 31, I believe is that release date.

So that is something I think a lot of investors are watching and mining the internet for--BRAD SMITH: Flooding the market?BRIAN SOZZI: --more information. Yeah, they basically-- they saw the digital brand. They wanted to make more money for it. They flooded the market all these cards and all this extra stuff. The market wasn't supportive of them doing this. And the true hardcore gamers have backlash against Hasbro. And it has become a risk, that key brand.]"

286,f69ab9e6-ed3e-3625-b36d-360f11ea97fa,AON,2023-01-28,Aon (AON) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aon-aon-expected-beat-earnings-150003117.html,1674831603,STORY,['AON'],"[Aon (AON) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 3, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis insurance brokerage is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.67 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.12 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.46% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Aon?For Aon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Aon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Aon would post earnings of $2.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.02, delivering a surprise of +0.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Aon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the same time, the Dow added 0.08%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 7.26%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's biggest hamburger chain had gained 3.31% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 10.13% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.73% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from McDonald's as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 31, 2023. On that day, McDonald's is projected to report earnings of $2.45 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9.87%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $5.7 billion, down 5.08% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for McDonald's. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 22.19.Story continuesWe can also see that MCD currently has a PEG ratio of 3.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Retail - Restaurants industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.03 as of yesterday's close.The Retail - Restaurants industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 173, which puts it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

Now exposure overseas and the impact of inflation on the US consumer also in focus. And for more, we are joined by Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma. Brooke, lay it all out for us, please.BROOKE DIPALMA: Good afternoon, Jared. That's right, McDonald's expected to report its fourth quarter earnings results on Tuesday before market open. Analysts, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates, expecting revenue to come in at $5.75 billion, and adjusted earnings per share coming in at 2.44, $2.44 there. US same store sales expected to jump 7.62%. Some of those drivers, including menu pricing after a year of record inflation, as consumers' wallets are stretched thin. And perhaps they're looking for a cheaper meal.Staffing level improvements also expected to be on the call. Innovation on the menu, as well as customer loyalty, especially when it comes to it's My McDonald's rewards, as well as those marketing initiatives. That got so much buzz this past quarter. Those are expected to have driven up US same store sales. We saw the adult Happy Meal. We saw the return of those Halloween [INAUDIBLE]. We also saw the return of the McRib, as well as sharing seasonal promotion happening in December.So those marketing initiatives definitely emphasized in the call, and analysts hoping to hear more about the accelerating the Arches campaign, now called 2.0, as it adds more to that strategic plan to really maximize marketing, commit to its core menu, as well as add to digital drive-thru and development. Of course, unit growth also expected to be buzz on the call.As far as overseas goes, sales are expected to go up 7.56%. They said, according to Citi's John Tower-- he's an analyst. And he said that he expects easing foreign exchange headwinds and improvement in foreign exposure, specifically saying that Europe may have seen the worst of inflation. And he expects that to impact the top and bottom line here. So lots expected this Tuesday from McDonald's.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: All right, Brooke, well, of course, that is the big story. But one of the stories that got my attention when it comes to McDonald's is what's happening with straws, or maybe the lack thereof. It looks like they might be following Starbucks here, reportedly testing out a strawless lid. What can you tell us about that?BROOKE DIPALMA: Seana, I can confirm that they are, in fact, testing straws-- strawless lids, that is. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, they said McDonald's is currently testing strawless lid for our cold beverages in select US markets. These lids help optimize our packaging and will limit the use of small plastics. Now, of course, this comes as McDonald's has looked to make headway in the sustainability efforts. They set a goal to have 100% certified recycled or renewable materials by 2025. So of course, we are getting closer to that goal.Also back in 2021, they announced efforts around more sustainable Happy Meals, so no more days of those Beanie Babies, it looks like. Of course, it's been years since that happened. But this does, in fact, come nearly 2 and 1/2 years after Starbucks set out with a similar initiative. They introduced their strawless lids. And it ultimately aimed to eliminate plastic straws entirely as now it looks like McDonald's is set to follow suit here. Of course, consumers not too happy about this one.]"

And 2022, with its 8% inflation and interest rate hikes, gave dividend investors plenty of straw hats from which to choose.High-quality stocks on sale are a much better bargain than buying poor performers just because they’re cheap or the yields are high. If you can get a market leader when it’s down by 20% or more, that is the time to buy.Take a look at one real estate investment trust (REIT) that, despite a rough 2022, has a long-term history that makes it a leader among similar REITs and has already demonstrated that 2023 could be a much better year.Prologis Inc. (NYSE: PLD) is a San Francisco-based industrial REIT that owns and manages almost 5,500 industrial logistics properties across the U.S. and in 18 other countries. Founded in 1983, Prologis has been a stalwart in appreciation among REIT stocks. It has the largest market capitalization of any REIT at $112.16 billion.Since its inception in November 1997, Prologis has generated a total return of 629.27%, or 8.21% per year. Prologis’s appreciation performance has been stellar, but it’s never been known for generating a high dividend yield.From 2018 to 2022, Prologis raised its quarterly dividend several times, increasing it from $0.48 to $0.79, but the yield remained low as the share price rocketed up by 95%. The annual dividend of $3.16 presently yields 2.5%, which is well below other REITs in its peer group. For a while in 2022, the dividend yield rose as high as 3.2% but has since fallen back as share prices have risen once more.On Jan. 18, Prologis reported its fourth-quarter 2022 operating results. Net earnings per diluted share for 2022 was $4.25, compared with $3.94 for 2021. However, net earnings per share of $0.63 for the fourth quarter was a large drop-off from $1.67 in the fourth quarter of 2021.Story continuesCore funds from operations (core FFO) were $1.24, compared with $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Core FFO of $5.16 for all of 2022 was well above the $4.15 for 2021. Average occupancy was 98.2%, with a retention rate of 82% and full-year rent growth of 28%.Despite these numbers, Prologis shares had a total 2022 return of negative 29.72%. Interest rate hikes slammed Prologis’s stock price from $164 in January to a low of $98 in mid-October. And although it’s bounced back to nearly $125.69 since, Prologis remains well below its all-time intraday high of $171.05 in April 2022.One problem to note going forward is that Prologis has already forecast that it expects its occupancy rate to decline from over 98% at the end of December to a range between 96.5% and 97.5% for 2023.Prologis is still guiding forward FFO for 2023, including promotes, in a range from $5.40 to $5.50 per share. Using the mid-point of $5.45, that easily covers the forward dividend with a payout ratio of 57.9% and comfortably allows for at least one more dividend increase in 2023.Prologis is up 11.54% since the New Year dawned and has now crossed back above its 200-day moving average. While that is positive, it may have come too far too fast and appears to be overextended with a stochastic oscillator that’s now overbought at 95.It would appear that Prologis, still well off its 2022 highs, could be a good buy at this level, but it’s not hard to imagine a pullback to between $116 and $120 before it once again begins to ascend above current levels. On any pullbacks, Prologis looks like a pretty good “straw hat” for 2023.Check Out More on Real Estate from BenzingaBezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Analysts Are Bullish On Industrial Real Estate: Here Are 2 Private Market Offerings To Gain ExposureTechies Will Soon Flood Austin Even Harder.

300,d0a3df52-36cc-3db3-9c3e-d32b0a2635ea,RHI,2023-01-28,7 Undervalued Income Stocks to Buy in January,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-income-stocks-buy-210415831.html,1674594255,STORY,"['SNA', 'UMC', 'AFL', 'PSX', 'SWK', 'BTI', 'RHI']","[Although the wild volatility of 2022 delivered some tempting market ideas for the new year, investors should also make some room for undervalued income stocks to buy. Fundamentally, dividend-paying enterprises offer tremendous relevancies because they help keep your portfolio right side up. And because of last year’s downpour, investors can scoop up quality names for cheap.Moving forward, it’s possible that the Federal Reserve could ease off its monetary tightening policy or perhaps slash interest rates. Such an action would likely spark upside mobility in risk-on asset classes, thereby rewarding growth-oriented enterprises. However, this projection isn’t guaranteed, which is why undervalued income stocks to buy remain intriguing.Besides, hurtling toward another ambiguous environment, anything can happen. You can mitigate some of the unpleasantries with the undervalued income stocks to buy listed below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRHIRobert Half$79.24AFLAFLAC$72.68SNASnap-on$241.17UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.84SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$87.69PSXPhillips 66$106.95BTIBritish American Tobacco$38.22Robert Half (RHI)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comUnder strained market environments such as the present juncture, you must take what Wall Street gives you. For instance, one of the hot topics – that’s actually a downer – in the economy right now is mass layoffs. With many high-paying white-collar jobs suffering the corporate axe, the resumes will start flying. Invariably, in my view, this circumstance should benefit the employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI).To be sure, RHI hasn’t enjoyed a great performance in the market. In the trailing year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Nevertheless, it’s one of the undervalued income stocks to buy. Again, the fundamental backdrop favors Robert Half. Increasingly, we may see rising desperation among white-collar workers, thus driving demand for the company’s services.Story continuesFinancially, the market prices RHI at nearly 13 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 15.8 times. As well, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics and a decently stable balance sheet. Though Robert Half’s forward yield of 2.16% isn’t anything to write home about, it’s also a very dependable payout.AFLAC (AFL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA specialist in the field of supplemental insurance, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) represents a boring business. Still, boring businesses tend to make solid candidates for undervalued income stocks to buy. Moreover, the wild events of the coronavirus pandemic will likely support rising demand for Aflac’s protective solutions.Essentially, the Covid-19 crisis forced Americans (and citizens of other privileged nations) to pop their delusional bubbles. No longer will once-in-a-century pandemics remain the exclusive domain of the foreign and exotic. Instead, Covid-19 made us all realize that the smelly stuff can roll downhill very quickly. And while we can’t do much about random catastrophes, we can protect ourselves financially.Aside from a great story, AFL objectively ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices Aflac shares at a trailing multiple of 9.13. For comparison, the sector median stands at 12.83 times.Finally, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.35%. No, it’s not the most generous yield but it’s a reliable payout. Indeed, the company features 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Snap-on (SNA)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAnother arguably boring idea, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) probably doesn’t get much airtime. However, that could change soon. With the Biden administration focused on repairing and revamping the nation’s various infrastructure networks, Snap-on could soar in relevance. Per the company’s public profile, it manufactures and markets high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry.While so many publicly traded securities stumbled in 2022, SNA did largely the opposite. In the trailing year, Snap-on gained over 13% of equity value. Further, in the company’s most recent third-quarter earnings report, it topped earnings and revenue estimates. Interestingly, analysts rate SNA a consensus moderate buy. And their average price target implies an upside potential of over 15%.Currently, the market prices SNA at both a trailing and forward multiple of 14.5. For both metrics, Snap-on trades conspicuously below the sector median multiple. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 2.71%. Thus, from a relevancy and dividend standpoint, SNA represents one of the undervalued income stocks to buy in January.United Microelectronics (UMC)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockDue to the severe global supply chain disruption impacting the broader technology space, it’s no surprise that semiconductor firm United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) suffered steep losses in 2022. In the trailing year, UMC gave up nearly 27% of equity value. That said, modern societies always move forward. Therefore, UMC could make for an interesting pickup among undervalued income stocks to buy.Indeed, the rest of the markets seem to think so. Since the January opener, UMC stormed out of the gates to a nearly 21% upside performance. Currently, Wall Street analysts rate United as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target implies a 24% upside potential from here on out. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, UMC also enjoys very positive sentiment among hedge funds.As well, the market prices shares at 9.7-times forward earnings, well below the sector median of 18.6 times. Further, United benefits from a strong balance sheet and excellent profit margins. Its forward yield of 3.59% represents the icing on the cake. It’s easily one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockArguably, when most people look for ideas to invest in, manufacturers of power tools don’t come readily to mind. However, with the aforementioned Biden administration pushing its infrastructure-building initiatives, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) could enjoy upside success. Notably, analysts from Data Bridge Market Research project that the power tools market could reach a valuation of $51.45 billion. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2021.To be fair, the market hasn’t been friendly to SWK. In the trailing year, shares plunged more than 50%, which is horrendous, needless to say. However, investors appear to see incredible value in SWK now. Since the January opener, the underlying company gained over 16% of market value. To add more encouragement, hedge fund sentiment for the power tools specialist ranks as very positive.Right now, the market prices SWK at a trailing multiple of 9.7. This compares quite favorably against the sector median of 20.6 times. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 3.62%, making it one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAlthough I’m starting to go back to the well a bit too many times with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), if you’re seeking undervalued income stocks to buy, it’s probably one of the best for more aggressive investors. Fundamentally, what’s attractive about the company centers on its downstream component of the energy value chain. Focusing on refining and marketing, it’s directly connected to where the economic rubber meets the road.In my estimation, there will be plenty of rubber meeting the same congested road soon. With major enterprises now demanding their remote workers to come back to the office, oil firms must be licking their lips. While worker bees might put up a fuss, under a recessionary environment, it’s wise to just toe the line. Otherwise, you could be on the unemployment line.Objectively, PSX ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy based on its trailing multiple. Presently, the market prices shares at 4.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median pings at 8.4 times. With a forward yield of 3.63%, it’s very difficult to ignore Phillips 66.British American Tobacco (BTI)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockSaving the most controversial name on this list of undervalued income stocks to buy, agnostically-minded investors may want to consider British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI). Politically, socially and ideologically, the tobacco industry commands as much respect as a dental practice with no anesthesia. Still, British American is evolving with the market, particularly with its cleaner-profile vaping/e-cigarette products.Cynically, it’s also possible that the associated mental health pressures stemming from a recession may lead to an increased usage of adult liberties. I’m not just talking about “analog” cigarettes but also the increased use of vaping products. Based on the available evidence, vaping is less harmful than smoking but it’s not 100% safe.On the financial front, BTI makes a case for undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.72. In contrast, the sector median stands at 12.2 times. Finally, British American offers a forward yield of 7.76%. That simply might be too tempting, even for conservative investors.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.Analysts' growing optimism on the earnings prospects of this truck maker is driving estimates higher, which should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- has this insight at its core.The five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.For Paccar, strong agreement among the covering analysts in revising earnings estimates upward has resulted in meaningful improvement in consensus estimates for the next quarter and full year.The chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSCurrent-Quarter Estimate RevisionsThe company is expected to earn $2.45 per share for the current quarter, which represents a year-over-year change of +42.44%.Over the last 30 days, four estimates have moved higher for Paccar while one has gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 13.65%.Current-Year Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, the company is expected to earn $9.26 per share, representing a year-over-year change of +7.3%.There has been an encouraging trend in estimate revisions for the current year as well. Over the past month, five estimates have moved up for Paccar versus one negative revision. This has pushed the consensus estimate 8.84% higher.Favorable Zacks RankThe promising estimate revisions have helped Paccar earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 13.05 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 24.44. PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.09 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.75, all within the past year.We also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 1.31. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.36. Within the past year, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.41 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.18.Investors should also recognize that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.99. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 3.18. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.53.Story continuesValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.35. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.94.These are only a few of the key metrics included in PACCAR's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 13.8% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $112.89 in the previous session. Paccar has gained 13.4% since the start of the year compared to the -47.8% move for the Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector and the -57.6% return for the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 24, 2023, Paccar reported EPS of $2.64 versus consensus estimate of $2.23.For the current fiscal year, Paccar is expected to post earnings of $9.26 per share on $30.75 billion in revenues. This represents a 7.3% change in EPS on a 12.57% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.91 per share on $28.33 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of -3.82% and -7.86%, respectively.Valuation MetricsPaccar may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Paccar has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 12.1X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 12.1X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 11.3X versus its peer group's average of 11.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.21. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Paccar currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Paccar meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Paccar shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.How Does PCAR Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of PCAR have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Fox Factory Holding Corp. (FOXF). FOXF has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of F.Earnings were strong last quarter. Fox Factory Holding Corp. beat our consensus estimate by 5.47%, and for the current fiscal year, FOXF is expected to post earnings of $5.77 per share on revenue of $1.58 billion.Shares of Fox Factory Holding Corp. have gained 18.2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 18.93X and a P/CF of 19.35X.The Automotive - Domestic industry may rank in the bottom 71% of all the industries we have in our universe, but there still looks like there are some nice tailwinds for PCAR and FOXF, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That's up from 29% in 2021. Now, consumer spending has remained strong despite fears of a recession. That is clearly evident in the Q4 earnings report that we just got from American Express.Amex cardholders are spending 24% more at restaurants than they were a year ago. Spend on lodging and airlines both seeing double-digit growth. Shares of Amex moving to the upside today-- big pop that we saw in shares, up nearly 11%. Joining us now is Bob Napoli, he's the William Blair Co-Group Head of Financial Services and Technology.Bob, it's great to see you here. So you have an outperform rating on American Express. We've gotten Visa and Mastercard also this week. You have an outperform rating on those as well. We've all been very concerned about a slowdown, about consumers pulling back. Are those fears clearly overblown because of these results?BOB NAPOLI: Well, again, the concerns are overblown because the consumer is under leveraged and they have jobs. And generally, when you have low consumer debt as a percentage of their income and they're employed, they're going to keep spending. So I think the fears of a bad recession are overblown.JARED BLIKRE: And just thinking about some of their key initiatives, especially with respect to their premium offerings, how does that affect the changes that have really happened to some of their user-- just to society overall, and travel habits, spending habits, saving habits that have changed over the last few years? How are their premium initiatives attacking that?BOB NAPOLI: Well, their premium initiatives-- they've added-- I guess they're targeting a higher percentage of younger-- 60% of new card members this year. They added a record amount of new card members, up more than 10% this year. 60% of those are millennials and Gen Zs.Story continuesAnd millennials and Gen Zs are really good at knowing how to use those rewards. And Amex has targeted things like Netflix, and gyms, and travel rewards to those younger consumers. Now, the rebound in travel certainly has been good for American Express as well.But they've developed those cards. I mean, those consumers are-- they're paying fees. I mean, American Express card isn't cheap. They pay a good annual fee. But they give you the rewards and high quality service that makes people willing to pay those fees.SEANA SMITH: Bob, when you take a look at these numbers from Amex, clearly, cardholders spending more on experiences-- spending was up 24%-- or they increased spending by 24% at restaurants than they did a year ago, clearly spending more on travel like you're saying. Do you see that spending pattern, those trends changing at all over the next couple of months as consumers maybe do brace for some sort of a slowdown?BOB NAPOLI: Well, you're going to see you're going to have tougher comps. So you're going to get more gradual increases in spending. I mean, the growing almost 30% revenue, that's not a sustainable level. I think double-digit revenue growth for Visa, Mastercard, for the payment space is sustainable.But you are going to see, as we lap those easier-- those tougher comps because of the rebound in COVID, you are seeing in the first quarter-- actually, you've seen really strong spending coming out of the gate in the month of January. Some of that is due to a year ago, we had Omicron.But spending continues to be strong. If we do get a bad recession, yeah, you'll see a pullback in consumer spending. I think where Amex is at the high end, you'll probably see less. But also, you still have more to go in international. I mean, China just reopened. Japan reopened in October.You saw a 50% increase in spending-- travel spending in Japan. China is the biggest travel market in the world. And you're going to see-- I mean that's going to be gradual over the course of this year where you'll see the rebound in China, which will carry over into Asia, which hasn't rebounded yet.So there's still more to go on the travel side. The consumer is employed. I mean, the Fed, I think a couple more rate increases and they're most likely done. So I think we're in a good place. The potential for a soft landing, I think, has increased.JARED BLIKRE: And I want to ask you-- a lot of companies talking about the strong dollar now. American Express has unique exposure to foreign currency. And I believe, at least historically, that has really benefited them whenever they have to change some of these money from dollars into euros, vice versa. How is that dynamic playing out with the currency-- with the volatility that we've seen in the dollar over the last year?BOB NAPOLI: Well, the volatility in currency-- actually, I think Visa and Mastercard probably benefit a little bit more of that. They have a higher percentage of international than Amex does. I mean the cross-border travel for Visa and Mastercard is a very, very profitable revenue stream.But the strength in the dollar is actually mixed, I would say, for those companies. But it certainly helps their earnings as you translate the foreign earnings into US dollars, they're worth more as the dollar weakens. But I do see some slowdown in some of the benefits on foreign exchange volatility for Visa, Mastercard. I see all three benefiting from the weaker dollar.SEANA SMITH: So, Bob, you have an outperform rating on all three. Clearly, you are bullish about what we could see over the next 12 months. If you had to pick one of those names, which one is positioned best?BOB NAPOLI: Well, the one that is the best stock to own and our top pick for this year is American Express. And the reason for that is that it's trading at a 50% discount to Visa, Mastercard. Visa, Mastercard are some of the best franchises in the world with the biggest-- with very large moats. But Amex is right there with them.And should it trade at a discount? Yes. A 50% discount is ridiculous. A discount to the S&amp;P 500 when Amex fundamentally has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over any period of time that you want to look at-- 5, 10, 15, 20 years-- you know, Amex is just not getting the respect it should. Sure, it's getting a little more today, but it's still only at 13 times next year's earnings. This stock should trade at 17 times an S&amp;P multiple, at least-- probably a premium to the S&amp;P.JARED BLIKRE: No respect-- a Rodney Dangerfield joke.BOB NAPOLI: Exactly.JARED BLIKRE: From back in the day, that's what came to mind there. Thank you. Great insights as always. Bob Napoli.]"

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 3, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis orthopedic device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, down 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zimmer?For Zimmer, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.37%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Zimmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zimmer would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.58, delivering a surprise of +1.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zimmer appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Stryker (SYK), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.95 billion, up 5.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Stryker has been revised 1.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.59%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Stryker will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.Story continuesHal Lawton: Thanks, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of a record year for Tractor Supply. Year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, and I'm pleased to share the results from the team in 2022. We had sales growth of 11.6% and diluted earnings per share growth of almost 13% and this is on top of a record performance in 2021. We had solid market share gains across all our product categories, and these gains continue to contribute materially to our sales growth. At Tractor Supply, it all starts with the team. And my sincere thanks and appreciation goes out to the more than 50,000 team members of Tractor Supply who work diligently every day to live our mission and values.Regardless of the operating challenges throughout the year and really over the last three years since we entered the pandemic, the team has delivered impressive results while also making significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. I commend and thank the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. Our team plus our business model are the reasons why we have a record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. With this year's results, we've now posted three consecutive years of exceptional sales growth. The highlight of this phenomenal track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Including new stores in the 53rd week, our revenue on a three-year basis has increased about 70%, with a three-year comp stack of 46.5%.Over the same period of time, we've invested nearly $1.7 billion in our stores, distribution centers, technology and other strategic initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. We also have significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint, and delivering on the increased volume of our consumable, usable and edible products. We've remained focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms. All with the underlying goal to be the dependable supplier that our customers count on. As a company, we hit several significant billion dollar milestones in 2022.We grew our sales to a record $14.2 billion, increased net income to over $1 billion, achieved $1 billion in private label credit card sales and returned more than $1 billion in capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year. This culminated with diluted earnings per share of $9.71. Now turning to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 performance. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Albeit, comp sales performance was stronger than forecast as the late December winter storm provided a comp sales lift of approximately two percentage points. Excluding the impact of the winter storm, importantly, our underlying results were in line with the high end of our expectations for the quarter.Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter and the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales growth was 8.6%, and it was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.3% and transaction count increase of plus 2.3%. And importantly, even without the winter storm benefit, our comp transactions would have been positive for the quarter. All months of the quarter, comped positive. October, December were our strongest comp sales months. Both two and three-year comp stacks were relatively consistent across the quarter. On e-commerce, it achieved mid single-digit positive sales growth, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. As of year-end, the Tractor Supply app has had over 4.4 million downloads since it was launched mid-2020.For the seventh consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the fourth consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of overall comp sales growth. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food as well as feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. As we've talked about many times, C.U.E. is one of our structural advantages and the products represent the strength of our core business and they're what drive trips to our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in big ticket categories. And we continue to gain share across our categories, both online and in-store. Shifting now to Neighbor's Club. Our Neighbor's Club membership exceeded 28 million members and represented nearly 75% of our sales for the year.Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the quarter, we reached a new record in the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping with us more frequently and spending more money per transaction. On Petsense, the rebranding of Petsense, the Petsense by Tractor Supply along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply is really resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers in our enterprise and help attract new pet customers to both brands. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging, with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 50% of sales at Petsense.During the quarter, we launched Tractor Supply, Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card allows our customers to earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. This marks exciting progress on our journey to drive sales, build loyalty and reduce tender expense through our credit offerings. And as I mentioned earlier, this past year, we crossed over $1 billion in private label credit card sales. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction score hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. Our team continued to make advancements in our supply chain through the expansion of our mixing centers to a total now of 15 as well as the grand opening of our ninth distribution center just last week.During the quarter, we also broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas to support for the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. In 2022, we moved more than 8 billion pounds of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the world's largest seller of back feed and food for livestock in campaign and animals. Our scale and reach provide us with the cost to serve that is lower than our competition. We continue to advance on our commitment to be stewards of Life Out Here. We're making progress on our absolute carbon reduction goals to further reduce emissions from our operations by 20% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030 from our 2020 baseline.We are committed to achieving net 0 emissions across all operations by 2040. Additionally, in 2022 of April, we announced an ambitious three-year water conservation goal to conserve 25 million gallons of water by 2025. These commitments to the climate and society reinforce our vision that a healthy environment, properly managed resources and vibrant communities are key to secure and prosperous future for Life Out Here. As a result, our efforts to enhance our sustainable business practices have been recognized by various third parties. We now have nearly 30% of our store base that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center build out is now active in over 300 locations. With nearly 1,800 team members, our field activity support team has made powerful contributions to our in-stock performance and execution of our sales-driving initiatives.We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store-level investments. This was a year that we made significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. And building on our performance for 2022, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term guidance. And Kurt will share more details on our outlook as well as more details on our performance in 2022 in just a moment. Now shifting a bit to 2023. As we planned for the year, we anticipate continuing to operate in an ever-challenging and changing macro environment. Our operating assumption is that the economy in the near to medium-term will remain resilient with flat to modestly positive real growth. Wages are increasing and consumers continue to tap pent-up savings to support spending.We expect consumers will continue to be judicious in their spend, but resilient, while prioritizing needs over discretionary. We believe inflation has peaked, but will remain sticky as we move through the year. It is our view that an orderly loosening of the labor market will be a key determiner of the country's ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions in the second half and 2024. The effects of secondary markets on our consumer spending in areas such as housing, agriculture and oil markets are expected to be collectively neutral and individually modest. Whatever economic environment plays out this year or any year for that matter, we're confident that our business will remain resilient and build on our strong track record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments.Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a need-based business that is tailored to the Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. We're celebrating our 85th anniversary this year. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt.Kurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me build on how sentiment for 2022. As we start out the year, we anticipated that our business would continue to exhibit consistent performance as we have a proven business model that has stood the test of time. The team delivered against our goals and exceeded our expectations. The impact of the 53rd week on our performance is detailed in our press release. To recap, the 53rd week added about $225 million to our net sales in the fourth quarter representing 6.8 points of our net sales growth. On a full year basis, it represented 1.8 points of the 11.6% growth year-over-year. Diluted EPS benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, all regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comp.All months were comp positive. As for the cadence of the quarter, our comp store sales were performing at the high end of our outlook as we move into mid-December. Then as Winter Storm Elliott moved across the country, our sales accelerated given the storm's impact on our customers' needs for heat, insulated outerwear, livestock feed and forage and some load up of other C.U.E. products. As Hal shared, we estimate the storm provided about 2 percentage point benefit to our comp sales. Much like any emergency response events such as hurricanes, the profitability of these sales from winter storm events of this magnitude is lower due to the mix of products and higher incremental operating costs. Our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here was exhibited during this historic storm.Looking back, when excluding the December winter storm comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all four quarters of the year. Similar to trends through the year, retail price inflation contributed about 11 points to our comparable store sales in Q4 as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 6.3% benefited from inflation, partially offset by a shift in sales mix to needs-based consumables versus the larger ticket items. Demand for C.U.E. categories was nearly 3 times the chain average, while big ticket sales performance was down mid-single digits. We did see strong performance in winter needs-based items such as heaters, snow throwers and log splitters.The performance in these big ticket categories somewhat offset the declines we saw in more discretionary categories like utility and recreational vehicles and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our gross margin improved by 28 basis points to an even 34% of sales. Our price management actions and other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from year-over-year product cost inflation, higher transportation costs and product mix due to the strength of C.U.E. categories. During the quarter, we experienced a significant moderation in the rate of price increases from our vendors, but by no means are we seeing deflation. Our promotional activity was in line with the prior year and we are seeing moderation in transportation costs that we expect to flow through in 2023.Of note, it's our belief that transportation costs most likely peaked in the fourth quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 25.1%. As we indicated in Q3, this increase was primarily attributable to three factors: one, the impact of transaction expenses and early integration costs associated with our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home; two, our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and three, our investments in team member compensation and benefits. These items were partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.43, an increase of 25.9% from the fourth quarter of last year.Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. Overall, we continue to believe that our inventory position is in good shape. Today, we believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our structural tailwinds such as rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership continue to benefit us. Our Life Out Here strategic investments have made us stronger. Adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term targets as we continue to see the power of compounding from our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent capital return to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases.For fiscal 2023, we are forecasting net sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion, including at least $300 million in sales from Orscheln. Our outlook marks another milestone in our performance as annual sales are forecasted to be above $15 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5%. We expect gross margin expansion of about 20 to 40 basis points from supply chain benefits and a moderation in both product cost increases and the mix impact of C.U.E. We anticipate SG&amp;A will deleverage modestly due to a few factors. Depreciation amortization is anticipated increase by 17% to 20% relating to our strategic growth initiatives. Also, we opened our ninth distribution center just this month. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&amp;A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin.We expect the incremental cost to pressure SG&amp;A by approximately 15 to 20 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. And lastly, the integration of Orscheln Farm and Home is expected to impact SG&amp;A by approximately 5 basis points. These factors are partially offset by the normalization of incentive compensation and leverage occupancy and other operating costs from the increase in comparable store sales. And for the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $55 million as we have increased borrowings to fund our capital allocation.We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of 2 times or below. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23%. We continue to expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10 in 2023. All in, diluted EPS is forecast in the range of $10.30 to $10.60. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the half of the year. As you model 2023, I want to point out a few things that will impact comparability. And I'd like to give a little color on the flow across quarters. From a sales perspective, we are planning for all four quarters to have comp sales performance generally within our guidance range. We anticipate retail price inflation to benefit comp sales by 3 to 5 points with the benefit being higher in the first half than the second half as inflation pressures begin to moderate.ESB Professional/Shutterstock.comWe are planning for positive comp transactions in 2023. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be fairly balanced between first half and second half. There are a couple of discrete items that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. The first quarter will likely be our toughest comparison from an operating margin rate perspective. Start-up costs for the new distribution center will pressure the first quarter, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized until the second quarter. Additionally, transportation costs are expected to continue to be higher year-over-year in Q1 and then begin to moderate through the remainder of the year with the second half expected to see favorable comparisons. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation in October when we cycle the acquisition date.Also keep in mind, the discrete items that impact our earnings comparability in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit, partially offset by the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition. And when adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the 2023 accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, our outlook for 2023 is consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11%. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $700 million to $775 million, with about 80% for growth initiatives. We expect to open approximately 70 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to be on track for 10 to 15 Petsense store openings in 2023. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year.We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2023, we anticipate share purchases in a range of $575 million to $675 million, which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Our business model has to the test of time and is proven to be resilient. While we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of economic growth on consumer demand, we believe that we are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. To wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we've made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strength and further expand our lead for years to come.And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal.Hal Lawton: Thank you, Kurt. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, Tractor Supply is a business that continues to have significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. Our position in our customer spending is for stable, needs based and demand driven product categories. We are in defensive product categories for the lifestyle our customers live. At the same time, we are playing offense to capture organic growth opportunities. We have idiosyncratic growth drivers that are separating us from the competition. As a company, three words that really summarize Tractor Supply's performance are: one consistent, two, reliable, and three, sustainable. And I'd like to walk through these three words and share what I see as structural tailwinds across them to support our future performance.Let's start first with consistent performance. We have a track record of delivering positive sales growth for over 30 consecutive years. 30 of the last 31 years have had positive comp sales. We've had consistent traffic growth across economic cycles and we're planning for positive traffic growth in 2023. Our marketplace has shown consistent growth for decades and decades. Our total addressable market of $180 billion continues to benefit from numerous trends that we believe are structurally found. Additionally by all accounts, we are gaining substantial share in our market. For instance, our queue product categories are driven by livestock feed for cattle, equine and poultry and companion animal food. In addition to categories like heating fuel, wildlife feed, pest control and lubricants, we're entering new product categories through our Garden Center transformations then open up new queue categories that provide a halo to the store as new and existing customers shop our expanded lawn and garden categories.Our stores with a Fusion layout and Garden Center transformations are gaining more customers than the balance of the chain. In just over two years since we started our Life Out Here strategy, we have gained significant scale in our Fusion remodels and the transformation of our sidewalks to Garden Centers. We have a substantial runway for growth ahead of us as we still have 70% of the chain to convert to the Fusion layout and the opportunity for another 1,000 plus Garden Center transformations. The comp lift for the Fusion remodels continues to run in the mid-single digits. When we execute a combination Fusion remodel and a Garden Center transformation of our sidelight, we have a comp lift in the high single digits. These projects provide us with the opportunity to continue our track record of consistent growth.The second word I would use to describe Tractor Supply is reliable. We are a need space, demand-driven business, and these product categories differentiate Tractor Supply from the bulk of retail. Our customers count on us for the products they need to deliver Life Out Here. Since relaunching our Neighbor's Club program in April of 2021, we have increased our high value customers by nearly 50%. Additionally, our high value customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more money. Our retention rate for our high value customers is about 80% with our retention rate for our highest tier customers at over 95%. Our Neighbor's Club program is a true competitive advantage for Tractor Supply. Once our customers in the flywheel of Neighbor's Club, their spending becomes much more reliable.Sustainable is the third key word to characterize our company. We've had tens of millions of new customers shop us the past three years. We have retained the majority of these customers and a substantial portion have become active Neighbor's Club members. We've added over 13 million members since 2019 with more than 5 million in 2022 alone. These strong results position us for sustainable growth ahead. Another important customer cohort that supports the sustainability of our outlook are the millennial customers and they continue to have more significant spending with us and in the years ahead of them. This group will make out nearly a quarter of the U.S. population by 2032, just 10 years from now. Our sales comps for millennials have outpaced non-millennials at Tractor Supply for five consecutive years, millennials over index and sales per customer, units per customer and average ticket.We view this strength that our millennial customer, not as a pull board, but rather as a catch up, as this group delayed family formation and the pandemic really shifted their behaviors to be much like prior generations. This cohort of the population is showing accelerated rates of home ownership and household formation. Today, 50% of millennials own homes versus 30% just a decade ago. So while they may have started a little bit later, we see an inflection point in the pace of home ownership and household formation for millennials. We are focused on retaining these new millennial customers as our data shows that they are roughly double their spending at TSC in their second year of shopping. And if they continue shopping with us for five years, we experience a threefold increase in transactions and sales per customer within five years of their initial purchase.Rural revitalization also continues to be a strong structural benefit for us. Millennials are increasingly choosing to move out here. This is not just a phenomenon of the pandemic, but rather a decade long trend of net migration out of urban areas that skewed disproportionately among this younger generation. The rural lifestyle appeals to millennials and it offers greater affordability, safety, self-sufficiency of slower pace, and the ability to pursue hobbies and passions. Many of the hobbies pursued by the millennials fit with our Out Here lifestyle. Tractor Supply enables passions and hobbies pursued by millennials, whether it is a pursuit as simple as making memories with family and friends or caring for pets and animals, or getting outside to hunt fish or camp, or being more self-sufficient and sustainable.Tractor Supply serves a key resource in our local communities for millennials to come to for trusted advice and expertise. Our passion for the lifestyle connects with our customers and allows us to serve them at scale. These three words, consistent, reliable and sustainable allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. As I started my remarks this morning, year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, but more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead and to focus on the opportunities ahead of us. With our Life Out Here strategy, we have ignited Tractor Supply's next horizon of strong and sustainable growth. 2023 is poised to be another great year for Tractor Supply. And with that operator, we now like to open the line for questions.See also 10 Value Stocks with Big Buybacks and 25 Wealthiest Countries in the World by GDP per Capita.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Prices could go down these days $10 or $20. And the priorities remain the same. It's, number one, protect that balance sheet. And of course, it's stellar for Chevron and Exxon. Number two, continue to have at least stable growth. They have that. And then, number three, look at the shareholder return. And that's where these companies now are able to step up. And we're seeing that.So, to me, I think why this group still is going to be one of the better sectors out there is, when you look-- I mean, even now, you look at Chevron. They pay over almost a 4% yield. And they're going to be, as I said-- you mentioned having a buyback that's three times higher than what it was last year. So as such, you're going to be receiving back, as an investor, almost 50% of your free cash flow, which, to me, is still superior versus any other sector.]"

The best banks for travelers don’t charge foreign transaction fees for purchases made on debit cards abroad and they place a special emphasis on security, fraud prevention and alerts.Pick a bank with a reputation for good customer service — variables like language barriers and time zones make emergencies even more challenging when you’re out of the country.Also, don’t assume you’ll have to pay for these perks. Many of the best banks for travelers charge no fees and have no account minimums. In fact, some pay a competitive yield.Finally, since financial regulations vary so much from place to place, most U.S. banks don’t operate many branches in other countries. That means you’ll want to choose a bank with a robust and reliable app that can let you perform most of the tasks you might otherwise do in person.Charles SchwabThe Schwab Bank Investor Checking account is worth a look even if you don’t travel. Not only are there no fees or account minimums, but Charles Schwab pays its checking customers a 0.45% yield.For those who do leave the country, the account is linked to the Schwab Bank Visa Platinum debit card and all its many international perks. There are no foreign transaction fees and millions of merchants accept it in more than 200 countries and territories.The card gives you beefed-up security abroad with extra features like travel notifications, two-way fraud text alerts, account and transaction alerts and card lock/unlock.Story continuesTake Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?Finally, you get unlimited monthly rebates for ATM cash withdrawal fees no matter where in the world you pick up the charges. If you need assistance while you’re on the road, Schwab won J.D. Power awards four years straight for customer service on its checking accounts.Capital OneThe 360 Checking Account makes Capital One a top contender for travelers looking for a bank that caters to their needs. Forbes cites the average foreign transaction fee as between 1%-5% of the price per purchase made overseas. Capital One joins Schwab in charging zero. According to Motley Fool, it’s one of the only major banks that does not charge a foreign transaction fee on any of its credit or debit offerings.Capital One lets you lock and unlock your Mastercard debit card from the mobile app and delivers real-time spending alerts. There are no fees to open, maintain and use a 360 Checking account and Capital One doesn’t require any minimums. Also, the bank does not charge any fees for using ATMs in other countries, but it ranks below Schwab because it does not refund fees that ATM owners often charge.BettermentKnown chiefly for its robo-advisor services, Betterment also offers a checking account with a lot to offer international travelers. You should consider Betterment only if you’re comfortable with a mobile-forward banking experience with no physical locations.Not only does the bank charge no fees of its own — including overdraft fees — but it reimburses 100% of any foreign transaction fees and ATM fees you incur anywhere in the world. In addition, you can change your PIN or lock your card from the mobile app and your money is FDIC insured just as it would be with a traditional bank.While it doesn’t pay a yield like a Schwab account, it has the unique advantage of earning cashback rewards at Costco, Adidas and thousands of other brands just like a credit card.HSBCHSBC is an outlier because its premier-only checking accounts require high account minimums — $75,000 in total deposits or investments. Alternatively, you can keep an account in good standing with at least $5,000 in recurring monthly direct deposits. If not, you’ll incur a $50 monthly fee. That’s $600 a year for a debit card — you could do better with several high-end travel rewards credit cards.However, if you do keep high balances or receive large regular deposits, HSBC Premier Checking has a lot to offer travelers beyond just its lack of foreign transaction fees. Premier status earns you priority service and emergency financial support at HSBC locations worldwide. If they lose their wallets, customers can access up to $10,000 in emergency cash in U.S. or local currency. Finally, you can use HSBC ATMs across the globe for free and receive international wire transfers at no cost.More From GOBankingRatesExperts: Here's How Much You Should Have in Your Checking AccountExplore GOBankingRates' 2023 Banking Resource CenterThe 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023Here's How To Build a 6-Month Emergency FundThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Best Banks for International Travelers]"

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 2.1%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern Norfolk Southern's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. However, Norfolk Southern's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 19.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 33% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendNorfolk Southern Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.88 total annually to $4.96. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Dividend Growth Is DoubtfulSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. Norfolk Southern has seen earnings per share falling at 5.2% per year over the last five years. If earnings continue declining, the company may have to make the difficult choice of reducing the dividend or even stopping it completely - the opposite of dividend growth. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Norfolk Southern's DividendOverall, this is a reasonable dividend, and it being raised is an added bonus. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. Taking all of this into consideration, the dividend looks viable moving forward, but investors should be mindful that the company has pushed the boundaries of sustainability in the past and may do so again.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

This was backed by robust sales growth, organic operating margin expansion, productivity savings and favorable currency impact.Although the company predicts a challenging operating environment for fiscal 2023, it remains confident of the resilience of its business and its ability to navigate through these headwinds. The company is confident about the long-term growth potential of the total beverage alcohol sector and expects to expand its value share by 50% in the sector to 6% by 2030.The company notes that it is on track to deliver on its medium-term guidance for fiscal 2023-2025, wherein it targets organic sales growth of 5-7% and organic operating profit growth of 6-9%.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 13.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s fall of 4.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research 1H FY23 HighlightsOn a reported basis, net sales increased 18.4% year over year, driven by strong organic growth and favorable currency effects. Organic net sales were up 9.4% year over year due to growth across all regions. The company’s diversified footprint, advantaged portfolio, strong brands and favorable industry trends of premiumization aided top-line growth.Organic volume improved 1.8% year over year. Price/mix grew 7.6% year over year, reflecting a high-single-digit price contribution to net sales growth. The company’s premium plus brands contributed 57% to net sales growth and 65% to organic sales growth. Its super-premium-plus brands aided organic net sales by 12%.In North America, Diageo’s largest market, sales accelerated 19% year over year on organic sales growth of 3% and strength across all markets. On a year-over year basis, DEO witnessed sales growth of 13% in Europe, 20% in the Asia Pacific, 9% in Africa and 34% in Latin America and the Caribbean.Strong growth in Europe was driven by organic growth of 10% and the hyperinflation adjustments related to Turkey. Sales in the Asia-Pacific reflected gains from strength across most markets, notably South East Asia, Travel Retail Asia and the Middle East and India. Growth across all markets, supported by price increases, aided sales growth in Africa. Latin America and the Caribbean sales growth reflected gains in Brazil, Central America, and the Caribbean and Mexico, mainly on price increases and premiumization.On a year-over year basis, Diageo also reported substantial growth across most categories, with growth of 28% slated for tequila, 19% for scotch, 10% for Spirits, 5% for Rum, 9% for beer and 8% for ready-to-drink. However, Vodka sales declined 2%. Gains in the beer business were driven by growth across all regions and double-digit growth of Guinness in Ireland, Great Britain and North America.The reported operating profit improved 15.2% year over year due to an improved organic operating profit and the positive impact of currency rates. The reported operating margin declined 92 basis points (bps) as the aforementioned gains were more than offset by exceptional operating items, acquisitions and disposals and other items.Organic operating profit rose 9.7% year over year, with the organic operating margin expanding 9 bps. Organic operating profit benefited from leverage in operating costs, driven by disciplined cost management, despite inflation. Moreover, growth was driven by supply productivity savings and price increases, which more than offset the higher cost inflation on the gross margin. Organic operating margin also reflected strong operating margin expansion in the Asia Pacific and Europe, partially offset by a decline in North America.Story continuesFinancialsIn the first half of fiscal 2023, Diageo delivered net cash from operating activities of £1,248 million, marking a decline of £699 million year over year. DEO reported strong free cash flow of £817 million, down £758 million from the last-year level due to strong working capital outflow, higher cash tax and interest, as well as increased capital investments.Diageo is committed to its disciplined approach to capital allocation, primarily to enhance its shareholder value. DEO increased the interim dividend 5% to 30.83 pence per share. This reflects its strong liquidity position and confidence in the long-term health of its business.Additionally, Diageo expects to complete the remaining £0.3 billion of share repurchases as part of the return of capital program of up to £4.5 billion in February 2023. Further, it expects incremental share buybacks of £0.5 billion in fiscal 2023.For fiscal 2023, the company expects capital expenditure of £1-£1.2 billion. Moreover, it expects to report strong free cash flow in the second half of fiscal 2023 compared with the first half due to the lapping of more normalized working capital outflows witnessed in the second half of fiscal 2022.Fiscal 2023 OutlookIn North America, the company expects organic net sales growth to normalize through the second half of fiscal 2023 compared to double-digit growth in the year-ago period. In Europe, organic net sales growth is likely to moderate in the second half of fiscal 2023 as the company’s laps the on-trade channel re-opening and recovery in the prior year. The company anticipates continued organic net sales growth for the Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean and Africa in the second half of fiscal 2023, although at a moderated pace relative to strong growth in fiscal 2022.The company expects to continue its revenue management initiatives, including pricing actions, throughout fiscal 2023, to overcome the challenging inflationary environment. It expects marketing investment to increase more than sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2023. The company anticipates the organic operating margin to benefit from continued premiumization trends, everyday efficiencies and operating expense leverage, offset by strong investments in marketing.The company estimates the tax rate before pre-exceptional items to be 22-24% in fiscal 2023. The effective interest rate is likely to be 4% in fiscal 2023.Looking for Solid Stocks?

329,5243baa3-c05d-30ce-9963-94df4b4ed7b7,KO,2023-01-28,Coke (KO) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coke-ko-considered-good-investment-143002458.html,1674829802,STORY,['KO'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.55, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.55 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 72.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Coke, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is KO Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.8% over the past month to $2.48.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Coca-Cola (KO) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.46 a share 18 days away from its upcoming earnings release on February 14, 2023.Coca-Cola's Earnings ESP sits at 2.98%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.46 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45.KO is one of just a large database of Consumer Staples stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Inter Parfums (IPAR).Inter Parfums is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on March 7, 2023. IPAR's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.34 a share 39 days from its next earnings release.For Inter Parfums, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.29 is 17.24%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, KO and IPAR could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

332,461a5aa6-1701-39fc-af5e-03aa7bfe75c9,INCY,2023-01-28,Incyte (INCY) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/incyte-incy-great-momentum-stock-170005482.html,1674838805,STORY,['INCY'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Incyte (INCY), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Incyte currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for INCY that show why this specialty drugmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For INCY, shares are up 2.93% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry is down 0.85% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.22% compares favorably with the industry's 13.05% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Incyte have increased 11.85% over the past quarter, and have gained 20.14% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 6.45% and -5.14%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to INCY's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. INCY is currently averaging 1,682,644 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with INCY.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost INCY's consensus estimate, increasing from $2.73 to $2.74 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that INCY is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Incyte on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST), Intuit Inc. (INTU) and Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Costco Wholesale have gained +1.2% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry’s gain of +3.1%. The company, being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving market turmoil pretty well. The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.These factors have been helping it register impressive sales and earnings numbers. The Zacks analyst expects the company to register a 3.8% adjusted earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2023 on 6.6% revenue growth.This outlook accounts for the businesses’ ability to navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply chain bottlenecks on several fronts. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power and strong liquidity position should help Costco keep outperforming. While trading at a premium to its peers, its long-term growth prospects should help the stock see a solid upside.(You can read the full research report on Costco Wholesale here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Intuit's shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-22.8% vs. -17.4%). The company is witnessing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds might significantly hurt small businesses operations, thereby posing risks for Intuit’s top-line growth. Additionally, higher costs and expenses due to increased investments in marketing and engineering teams are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results in the near term.Nevertheless, Intuit is benefiting from strong momentum in online ecosystem revenues and solid professional tax revenues. The TurboTax Live offering is also driving growth in the Consumer tax business. Solid momentum in the company’s lending product, QuickBooks Capital, remains a positive.Moreover, the company’s strategy of shifting its business to cloud-based subscription model will help generate stable revenues over the long run.

The company is the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, the firm is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets.Higher oil prices is aiding its overall business. SLB reported strong fourth-quarter results driven by strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. It made significant progress in its sustainability initiatives in 2022. SLB expects its Transition Technologies portfolio to cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.  However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry.

337,651fa9d1-bc38-3a85-ae7d-8b580036e676,SYK,2023-01-28,Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zimmer-biomet-zbh-expected-beat-150003877.html,1674831603,STORY,"['ZBH', 'SYK']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 3, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis orthopedic device maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.76 billion, down 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zimmer?For Zimmer, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.37%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Zimmer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zimmer would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.58, delivering a surprise of +1.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zimmer appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Stryker (SYK), is soon expected to post earnings of $2.84 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%.

339,72d1cc26-7e4b-3b54-b598-b2d645c84b84,SRE,2023-01-28,"Get ready for a massive SoCalGas bill this month, as natural gas prices soar",LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ready-massive-socalgas-bill-month-130004684.html,1673010004,STORY,['SRE'],"[Natural gas customers of Southern California Gas should brace for a price shock in January, as the commodity price for the fuel has tripled. (Getty Images)The warning Southern California Gas Co. issued to its customers was unusually blunt: “There’s no easy way to put this,” the company said. “January bills are likely to be shockingly high.”Anyone who heats their home with natural gas is likely to see a January bill that is more than double what they paid a year earlier, SoCalGas said.A typical peak monthly bill of $65 from last winter will probably come in close to $160, SoCalGas said, a 146% increase. A $130 bill will be more like $315, up 142%.The increases result from the soaring wholesale price of natural gas paid by SoCalGas and passed through to its customers. That price, set by national and regional markets, rose 2 1/2 times over December’s price, and is up more than 300% from January 2022, according to SoCalGas.(Since this story was first published, national market prices have dropped, but the effect on California wholesale prices and on the next round of Southern California customer gas bills is yet to be determined.)Tom Cox of Westchester hasn’t yet received his January bill, but he’s anxious. He said his family works hard to conserve energy but saw their monthly bill shoot from $22.46 in November to $100.56 in December. For December of 2021, it was nearly half that, $56.96.“Our bill is not high compared to what I’ve heard” others with bigger properties are paying, he said.And it’s not just gas bills. Your electric bill will be going up too.Southern California Edison said rates will rise 7.2% in January, mainly because of the rising price of natural gas. Natural gas is the source of about 22% of the company’s electricity, so when gas prices go up, electricity prices go up too.Natural gas use in Southern California usually goes up during the winter months, as homes and businesses use gas for heating. January usually is the peak month.Gas prices are jumping across the state. In the territory served by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., a household that paid a $105 bill last January will pay about $225 this month, the utility estimated. That’s an increase of 114%.Story continuesEdward Lopez, executive director of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers’ Action Network, said his organization started receiving complaints about higher gas bills before the holidays.""If in fact SDG&amp;E customers see that type of hike [in gas bills], that is just so unreasonable and so painful,"" Lopez said. ""It's creating tough, tough choices for SDG&amp;E customers in terms of not only how they pay their bill but making choices as to exactly what bills, including bills for other essential items, that they can afford to pay.""SoCalGas and other utilities have attributed the sudden and dramatic surge in prices to unusually cold winter weather in California and the Pacific Northwest, which boosted demand for heat, as well as supply and distribution constraints.The U.S. Energy Information Administration pointed to reduced capacity because of pipeline maintenance in West Texas that lowered westbound natural gas flows. The EIA reported that Pacific region natural gas storage inventories in December were 30% below the five-year average.Some parts of the country more closely tied to pipeline distribution systems are seeing a decline in natural gas prices. So is Europe, whose winter is proving warmer than expected.Although colder winters do cause price hikes, “[natural] gas prices don’t just double overnight because things got a little colder than last year,” said Jamie Court of Consumer Watchdog.Court said prices are being pushed higher in part because of natural gas supply that has been shipped in the form of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which had been building stockpiles in the face of natural gas cutoffs from Russia since that country invaded Ukraine in February.“This is about all the LNG we are exporting to Europe,"" Court said. ""They’re selling our natural gas to Europe because they get a higher price."" The resultant inventory shortages lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers, he said — and the companies can put on the squeeze because “consumers really need it.”Although the broad reasons for the price hikes are easy to explain through supply and demand, the details on company pricing decisions are hard to come by — as was made clear in the aftermath of last summer’s sky-high gasoline prices. Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing what’s become known as a “price gouge penalty” in the state Legislature that would, in effect, tax “excessive profits” at gasoline refineries.A SoCalGas spokesperson noted that the company’s profit is limited through regulation, and the utility doesn’t benefit from higher wholesale prices. The wholesale — or commodity — price of natural gas accounts for more than 90% of the increase that utility customers pay.SoCalGas and SDG&amp;E are owned by energy giant Sempra, a big player in shipping LNG to Europe from the U.S.California depends on other states for 90% of its natural gas, most of it from New Mexico, Wyoming, Texas and Alberta, Canada. Natural gas production in California continues to dwindle. Natural gas and oil production are tightly related, and oil production in California is about two-thirds of what it was in 1985.To combat the emissions of greenhouse gases, California political leaders are aggressively moving the state away from fossil fuel production and consumption toward solar and wind power. The California Air Resources Board is planning to implement a ban on new natural gas heaters, water heaters and furnaces in the state by 2030. The Los Angeles City Council passed a similar measure last May.That will reduce greenhouse emissions and alleviate indoor toxins from gas heaters and stoves. But that will further decrease natural gas drilling in California. And California policies are in effect forcing existing oil wells to shut down, said Kevin Slagle, spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Assn. “With fewer wells, you have less production,” he said.Although the nosebleed level of natural gas prices now may prove an anomaly, both the California Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission expect average natural gas prices to trend higher at least through 2030.Both agencies, along with the Public Utilities Commission, the governor, and the legislature, are struggling to transition away from fossil fuels without raising fossil fuel prices in the meantime so high that it provokes a public outcry.The utilities commission ""for some time now has tried to focus on trying to bring energy costs in line, make them much more affordable,"" consumer advocate Lopez said. ""But we still haven't seen a significant difference yet.""Mitchell is a Times staff writer. Nikolewski writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"
340,76f7b5ba-9b5f-3793-8c07-a6305fcb1eaa,CINF,2023-01-28,Cincinnati Financial Corporation Announces Preliminary Results and Increased Regular Quarterly Cash Dividend,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cincinnati-financial-corporation-announces-preliminary-215200392.html,1674856320,STORY,['CINF'],"[CINCINNATI, Jan. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Cincinnati Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: CINF) today announced that its consolidated fourth-quarter results are expected to include pretax catastrophe losses of approximately $141 million – representing an impact on the fourth-quarter 2022 combined ratio of approximately 7.8 percentage points, based on estimated property casualty earned premiums. The company's 5‑year historical average contribution of catastrophe losses to the combined ratio is 3.9 percentage points for the fourth quarter.The catastrophe loss estimate includes $161 million from Winter Storm Elliott, net of reinsurance and excluding any effects of reinstatement premiums assumed or ceded, in addition to less severe storms and favorable loss reserve development on previous catastrophe events, primarily ones that occurred in 2022. The estimate for total fourth-quarter 2022 catastrophe losses incurred includes approximately $100 million for the commercial lines insurance segment; $38 million for the personal lines insurance segment; $2 million for the excess and surplus lines insurance segment and $1 million in total for Cincinnati Re® and Cincinnati Global Underwriting LtdSM.Estimated losses and expenses from catastrophe-related claims are expected to bring the company's fourth-quarter 2022 property casualty combined ratio to approximately 95%. The combined ratio before catastrophe losses for the quarter was approximately 2.5 percentage points better than that ratio for the first nine months of 2022 but continued to reflect increased uncertainty of estimated ultimate losses, due in part to elevated paid losses reflecting economic or other forms of inflation. Net written premium growth is estimated to be approximately 10% for the quarter.A rising stock market helped fourth-quarter 2022 earnings as net income is estimated to be between $6.37 and $6.43 per share, with non-GAAP operating income ranging from $1.24 to $1.30 on a per share basis. To reconcile net income to operating income, net investment gains and losses on an after-tax basis is removed.Story continuesThe company also announced that at today's regular meeting, the board of directors declared a 75-cents-per-share regular quarterly cash dividend, increasing by 9% from the previous 69-cents-per-share dividend paid on January 13, 2023. The dividend is payable April 14, 2023, to shareholders of record as of March 17, 2023.Steven J. Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer, commented, ""We keep a long-term view when managing our business and creating value for shareholders of Cincinnati Financial. Increasing the dividend signals the board's confidence in our ability to maintain the profitable growth of our insurance business while also continuing to return capital to shareholders.""Cincinnati Financial shareholders have consistently benefited from increased dividends in each of the past 62 years, and this board action lays the foundation for continuing that record for a 63rd year.""The unaudited loss estimates and other data presented in this release is preliminary, based upon management estimates and subject to the completion of the company's procedures for the preparation of its quarterly financial statements. As a result, further adjustments may be made between now and the time financial results for the quarter are finalized. Cincinnati Financial plans to report final results for fourth-quarter 2022 on Monday, February 6, after the close of regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Homer Bhullar, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Bhullar. You may begin.Homer Bhullar: Good morning everyone and welcome to Valero Energy Corporation's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Joe Gorder, our Chairman and CEO; Lane Riggs, our President and COO; Jason Fraser, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Gary Simmons, our Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and several other members of Valero's senior management team. If you have not received the earnings release and would like a copy, you can find one on our website at investorvalero.com. Also attached to the earnings release are tables that provide additional financial information on our business segments and reconciliations and disclosures for adjusted metrics mentioned on this call. If you have any questions after reviewing these tables, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call.I would now like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release. In summary, it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations, including those we've described in our filings with the SEC. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks.Joe Gorder: Thanks Homer and good morning everyone. We finished the year strong with our refineries operating at 97% capacity utilization in a favorable refining margin environment. In fact, this is the highest refinery utilization for our refining system since 2018. I'm also proud to share that 2022 was the best year ever for combined employee and contractor safety, which is a testament to our long-standing commitment to safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations. As we saw during most of 2022, refining margins were supported by low product inventories, which resulted from the significant permanent global refinery shutdowns and the continued recovery in product demand. Our refining system also benefited from heavily discounted sour crude oils and fuel oils.Story continuesThese discounts were driven by increased sour crude oil supply, high freight rates, and the impact from the IMO 2020 regulation for lower sulfur marine fuels. Also, high natural gas prices in Europe incentivize European refiners to process sweet crude oils in lieu of sour crude oils, adding further pressure on sour crude oils. And our refining projects that are focused on reducing cost and improving margin capture remain on track. The Port Arthur Coker project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023 and will increase refinery's throughput capacity and ability to process incremental volumes of sour crude oils and residual feedstocks while also improving turnaround efficiency. In our Renewable Diesel segment, we continue to expand operations, and we set another sales volume record in the fourth quarter with the successful commissioning and start-up of the new DGD Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in November.That project was completed under budget and ahead of schedule and brings DGD's annual production capacity to approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. In the Ethanol segment, BlackRock and Navigators carbon sequestration project is still progressing on schedule and is expected to begin start-up activities in late 2024. We expect to be the anchor shipper with eight of our ethanol plants connected to this system, which is expected to result in the production of a lower carbon intensity ethanol product that should significantly improve the margin profile and competitive positioning of the business. And we continue to advance other low-carbon opportunities such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable hydrogen and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects.Our gated process helps ensure these projects meet our minimum return threshold. On the financial side, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, paying off all of the incremental debt incurred during the pandemic and ending the year with a net debt to-capitalization ratio of 21%. Looking ahead, we expect low product inventories and continued increase in product demand to support margins, particularly for US coastal refiners that have crude oil supply and natural gas advantages relative to global refineries. And we continue to see large discounts for heavy sour crude oils and fuel oils that we can process in our system. The startup of the Port Arthur Coker is also expected to have a significant earnings contribution in the back half of 2023, supported by wide sour crude oil differentials and strong diesel margins.In closing, we're encouraged by the refining outlook, which, coupled with the contribution from our strategic growth projects in refining and renewable fuels, should continue to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage and shareholder returns. So with that, Homer, I'll hand the call back to you.Homer Bhullar: Thanks, Joe.

Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $4.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Refining throughput volumes in the fourth quarter of 2022 averaged 3 million barrels per day. Throughput capacity utilization was 97% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Refining cash operating expenses of $5 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $0.14 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily attributed to higher natural gas prices. Renewable Diesel segment operating income was $261 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $150 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.Photo by Jason Blackeye on UnsplashRenewable Diesel sales volumes averaged 2.4 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was 851,000 gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. The higher sales volumes were due to the impact of additional volumes from the DGD St. Charles plant expansion and the fourth quarter 2022 start-up of the DGD Port Arthur plant. The Ethanol segment reported $7 million of operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $474 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $69 million compared to $475 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Ethanol production volumes averaged 4.1 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2022. The higher operating income in the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily attributed to multi-year high ethanol prices due to strong demand and low inventories.For the fourth quarter of 2022, G&amp;A expenses were $282 million and net interest expense was $137 million. G&amp;A expenses were $934 million in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $633 million and income tax expense was $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. The annual effective tax rate was 22% for 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $12.6 billion for the full year. Excluding the unfavorable change in working capital of $9 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion in 2022 and the other joint venture member share of DGD's net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in DGD's working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $4 billion for the fourth quarter and $13.8 billion for the full year.Regarding investing activities, we made $640 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2022, of which $349 million was for sustaining the business, including costs for turnarounds, catalysts and regulatory compliance and $291 million was for growing the business. Excluding capital investments attributable to the other joint venture members share of DGD and those related to other variable interest entities, capital investments attributable to Valero were $538 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $2.3 billion for the year, which is higher than our annual guidance primarily due to project spend timing on the Port Arthur Coker project and the accelerated completion of the DGD Port Arthur plant. Moving to financing activities.We returned $2.2 billion to our stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $6.1 billion in the year, resulting in a 2022 payout ratio of 45% of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities through dividends and stock buybacks. With respect to our balance sheet, we completed additional debt reduction transactions in the fourth quarter that reduced Valero's debt by $442 million through opportunistic open market repurchases. As Joe noted earlier, this reduction, combined with a series of debt reduction and refinancing transactions since the second half of 2021, have collectively reduced Valero's debt by over $4 billion. We ended the year with $9.2 billion of total debt, $2.4 billion of finance lease obligations and $4.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents.The debt-to-capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents was approximately 21%, down from the pandemic high of 40% at the end of March 2021, which was largely the result of the debt incurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we ended the year well capitalized with $5.4 billion of available liquidity, excluding cash. Turning to guidance. We expect capital investments attributable to Valero for 2023 to be approximately $2 billion, which includes expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts and joint venture investments. About $1.5 billion of that is allocated to sustaining the business and $500 million to growth. For modeling our first quarter operations, we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges: Gulf Coast at 1.59 million to 1.64 million barrels per day; Mid-Continent at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day; West Coast at 245,000 to 265,000 barrels per day; and North Atlantic at 415,000 to 435,000 barrels per day.We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately $4.95 per barrel. With respect to the Renewable Diesel segment, we expect sales volumes to be approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2023. Operating expenses in 2023 should be $0.49 per gallon, which includes $0.19 per gallon for non-cash costs such as depreciation and amortization. Our Ethanol segment is expected to produce 4 million gallons per day in the first quarter. Operating expenses should average $0.51 per gallon, which includes $0.05 per gallon for noncash costs such as depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter, net interest expense should be about $130 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately $655 million.For 2023, we expect G&amp;A expenses, excluding corporate depreciation, to be approximately $925 million. That concludes our opening remarks. Before we open the call to questions, please adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q&amp;A to two questions.

At $66 per barrel, Chevron’s average realized liquids prices in the U.S. were $3 above the year-earlier levels while prices overseas rose 5.4%. On the natural gas front, its realizations improved 3.3% and 31%.Downstream: Chevron’s downstream segment recorded a profit of $1.8 billion, more than doubling from last year’s figure of $760 million.

Through this investment strategy, shareholders can gain long-term benefits because of the power of compounding. Many popular dividend companies like The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) offer DRIP policies to investors without any additional charges.Rising inflation and lingering threats of a possible recession have brought forward the importance of dividend stocks. Historically, dividends have shown strong performance in high-interest rates periods. Morningstar’s November report also mentioned that dividend stocks outperformed the broader market during the Great Inflation decade of the 1970s. Readers can also check out 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A Recession to explore other investment options during these uncertain times.According to a report by Hartford Funds, reinvested dividends represented 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 since 1960. The report also mentioned that companies that have raised their dividends for a certain period returned more than those that showed no change in their dividends or slashed their payouts. Dividend growers and initiators delivered an annual average return of 10.68% from 1973 to 2021, compared with a 4.79% return of non-dividend payers during the same period.Another report by Welch &amp; Forbes LLC also highlighted the long-term benefits of reinvested dividends.

Thanks for joining us. This morning, American reported a fourth quarter GAAP net income of $803 million and a full year net income of $127 million. Excluding net special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $827 million and a full year net income of $328 million. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was driven by continued strength of demand and revenue environment and incredible efforts of the American Airlines team. We're tremendously proud of what the team has accomplished over the past year. We're committed to running a reliable operation, and we're delivering. Coming out of the holidays, American had the best completion factor of any major U.S. airline.We also said we would return American to profitability, and we've done that as well. Our team has delivered a third consecutive quarterly profit and fourth quarter margins that are higher than the fourth quarter of 2019 despite our fuel price increasing by approximately 70%. We generated nearly $2.4 billion in pre-tax profits over the past three quarters, and we're pleased to report a full year profit for the first time since 2019. In addition to running a reliable operation and generating sustained profits, we're making significant progress on repairing our balance sheet. We recently prepaid a $1.2 billion term loan a year before scheduled maturity date, and we have now reduced our total debt by more than $8 billion from peak levels in mid-2021.This puts us well past the halfway point of our $15 billion total debt reduction goal only 18 months into the program. Derek will talk more about our deleveraging plans in just a few minutes. Let's talk more about the fourth quarter and full year results. We produced revenues of $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 16.6% versus 2019 and the highest fourth quarter revenue in company history. Notably, we achieved this record revenue while flying 6.1% less capacity than we did in the fourth quarter of 2019. American also produced record revenues of $49 billion for the full year, which is a 7% increase over 2019, while flying 8.7% less capacity. Demand remains strong and our revenue performance is in line with our expectations following our strong holiday performance.Post-holiday bookings are off to a strong start. In fact, this is our best ever post-holiday booking period with broad strength across all entities and travel periods. Demand for domestic and short-haul international travel continues to lead the way. We expect a strong demand environment to continue in 2023 and anticipate further improvement in demand for long-haul international travel this year. Now turning to the operation. The American Airlines team delivered a fantastic performance in the fourth quarter. We operated more than 475,000 flights in the quarter with an average load factor of approximately 84%, and we ranked first in completion factor among the nine largest U.S. carriers. Our team delivered an even stronger performance over the holidays, despite challenging conditions in many parts of the country.American outperformed the industry over the December holiday period, ranking first in completion factor. Key to our success has been sizing our airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we expect to encounter. And we will continue to do that going forward. We're doubling down on our efforts to run a reliable operation in 2023, including investing in our team, our fleet and technology to support our operations and we're seeing this work pay off as our operation is off to a strong start just a few weeks into 2023, including the best on-time arrival performance of the nine largest U.S. carriers so far this year. American is proud to operate the simplest, youngest and most efficient fleet among U.S. network carriers.In August, we began taking deliveries of new 788 aircraft from Boeing for the first time in 15 months. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of five 788s, and we expect to receive the remaining four in the first half of 2023. Our Boeing 789s are expected to be delivered starting in 2024. During the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry about that. Okay. During the fourth quarter, we also took delivery of seven A321neos, three 175s and three -- and five 737-800s from long-term storage. Devon is going to talk more about that. But what I'd like to say is that the results the American Airlines team produced in 2022 and what we are projecting in 2023 are proof positive that the actions we have taken in the recent years have put us in a position of strength and allowed us to take full advantage of the recovery.We spent more than five years on the most complex integration in the history of the airline industry. Three years navigating the pandemic and making the airline more efficient. And now we're poised to drive the business forward in 2023 and beyond. We have simplified and harmonized our fleet, modernizing our facilities, fine-tune our network to focus on the most profitable plan, develop new partnerships, introduced new tools for our customers and team and hired tens of thousands of people. During all, the American Airlines team has gone above and beyond to deliver strong operational and financial results. Now before I turn it over to Derek to provide more detail on our 2022 financial performance, I want to thank him for his partnership over the past 20 years as CFO.He is a great friend and he's been a trusted advisor throughout my career. Quite simply, he's the best CFO in the history of the airline industry. This financial leadership has helped create the largest airline in the world through the mergers of America West and U.S. Airways in 2005 and U.S. Airways and American in 2013. Derek was instrumental in raising $25 billion of capital during the pandemic to ensure American would not just survive, but also be in a position to thrive on the other side of it. And I'm very pleased that Derek will remain as American, Vice Chair and continue to lead our American Eagle and cargo teams and serve as a strategic advisor to the company. As we look forward to 2023, we remain focused on running a reliable operation, achieving sustained profitability and reducing debt.Pixabay/Public DomainWe have made tremendous progress in all three of these areas, thanks to Derek's leadership, and we will continue to sharpen that focus with Devon May as our CFO. And on behalf of the entire American Airlines team, I want to thank Derek for his leadership and tremendous contributions to the airline as our CFO. And now, I'll hand it over to Derek.Derek Kerr : Well. Thank you, Robert. Thanks for your kind words. I really appreciate it. It's been an honor, tremendous honor to serve as CFO of American, U.S. Airways and America West over the past 20 years. I'm incredibly proud of what the team has accomplished in that time. Now on to the business of the morning. Excluding special items, we reported a fourth quarter net income of $827 million or earnings of $1.17 per diluted share. We produced our best fourth quarter pre-tax margin since 2016 when we produced roughly the same results at fuel prices that were nearly double the price per gallon lower than 2022. Throughout 2022, you heard us talk about our focus on returning the airline to profitability, and we have done that.We achieved a full year profit due to continued demand strength and the hard work of our team, despite a $1.9 billion pre-tax loss in the first quarter. Excluding net special items, we produced a full year net income of $328 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Fourth quarter revenue far exceeded our initial guidance due to continued strong demand. Revenue in the fourth quarter was higher than any fourth quarter in company history. As Robert mentioned, the domestic and short-haul international entities continue to lead the way, and we expect further improvement in long-haul international as we continue to grow back our capacity. Costs for the quarter, excluding fuel came in at the high end of our initial guidance range, primarily due to higher profit sharing expense driven by higher earnings in the quarter.American is proud to operate the simplest, youngest and efficient fleet among U.S. network carriers. In August, we began taking deliveries of our new 788 aircraft from Boeing for the first time in 15 months. In the fourth quarter, we took delivery of five 788s, and we expect to receive the remaining four in the first half of 2023. Our Boeing 789s are expected to be delivered starting in 2024. During the fourth quarter, we also took delivery of seven A321neos, three E175s and reactivated five 737-8s from long-term storage. In 2023, we expect to take delivery of two A321neos, and we plan to reactivate nine more 738s from long-term storage. Based on our latest guidance from Boeing, we now expect to take delivery of 17 737 MAX 8s in 2023 compared to Boeing's contractual commitment of 27 deliveries.This change in timings will shift planned CapEx out of 2023 and into future years. Our 2023 aircraft CapEx is now expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. Repairing our balance sheet remains a top priority, and our actions in the fourth quarter show our commitment to debt reduction. In the fourth quarter, we repaid $1.2 billion term loan secured by domestic slots. This prepayment increased estimated first lien borrowing capacity to $10.3 billion and addressed our most significant 2023 maturity. With the actions we have taken, we have now reduced our total debt by $8.2 billion or more than half of our goal to reduce total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025, only 18 months into our deleveraging program. We ended the year with $12 billion of total available liquidity.We will continue to balance both debt reduction opportunities and investments in the business while meeting appropriate target liquidity levels. We will target $10 billion to $12 billion of total liquidity in the medium term and intend to utilize excess liquidity to accelerate our deleveraging initiative at the appropriate time. With no meaningful maturity towers until 2025, we have the flexibility as to how and when we begin to address those instruments. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Devon May, who will share our outlook for 2023. Devon has more than 20 years of airline industry experience across finance, operations, network planning and alliances, and he is the perfect person to lead our finance organization going forward.He has been an integral part of our executive team for more than a decade and has built a great team around him. The CFO transition has been and will continue to be a seamless one. With that, I'll turn it over to Devon.Devon May : Thank you, Derek, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into our guidance, I want to start by thanking Derek for his leadership over the past 20 years. I've had the privilege of working with Derek since 2002 when I joined America West Airlines. He has been a close brand and mentor during this time, and our airline is set up well for the future because of his leadership. I'm honored to be taking on the CFO role and being part of an incredible senior leadership team. I look forward to leading the finance team and building on the progress we've made on our financial priorities. For 2023, we will continue to size the airline for the resources we have with a focus on reliability and sustained profitability. We continue to expect to produce capacity that is 95% to 100% of 2019 levels or up approximately 5% to 8% year-over-year.We are on track to hire over 2,000 mainline pilots in 2023, and we expect to achieve our run rate level of training throughput in the back half of this year, allowing for further aircraft utilization improvements in 2024. We continue to expect regional pilot affordability to be constrained throughout this year and next. Demand for air travel strengthened as we went through 2022, and we expect industry revenue will return to its historical share of GDP in 2023. Given our level of capacity production, the strength of our network and industry supply constraints, we expect total unit revenue to be up low single digits year-over-year. For the full year, we expect CASMx to be up 2% to 5% versus 2022. These projections include the estimated impact of anticipated labor agreements, which account for roughly 3 points of CASMx fuel.For the full year, we expect to produce earnings of $2.50 to $3.50 per diluted share. Using the midpoint of that EPS guidance, we are forecasting operating cash flows of approximately $5.5 billion and free cash flow of nearly $3 billion. Looking to the first quarter, we expect to produce an operating margin of between 2.5% and 4.5% based on our current demand and fuel price forecast. And while we are eager to get new labor agreements ratified given where we are at in the quarter and the time required for ratification, we do not anticipate ratifying new contracts prior to the end of the first quarter. If that does occur, we will update our guidance accordingly. In the first quarter, continued strength in demand is expected to result in total revenue per available seat mile that is 24% to 27% higher year-over-year.Our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, is expected to be flat to down 3% year-over-year. The current fuel forecast for the first quarter assumes a fuel price of between $3.33 and $3.38 per gallon and a full year price of between $3 and $3.10 per gallon. As Derek noted earlier, we'll continue to focus on debt reduction, and I'm proud of the progress we have made to date. In 2023, we expect to make further progress on our $15 billion debt reduction goal. We will use our free cash flow to pay down $3.3 billion in debt amortization this year, and we expect that by the end of 2023, we will have reduced total debt by $10 billion to $11 billion from peak levels in mid-2021. Based on the forecast I just provided, we expect that by the end of the first quarter, we will have lower net debt and better net debt to EBITDAR than we did at the end of 2019.And by the end of the year, we anticipate having the lowest net debt-to-EBITDA ratio we have had since 2017. In conclusion, in 2023, we will continue to focus on delivering on our stated objectives. We are set up to run a reliable airline, grow margins and strengthen the balance sheet. Importantly, American is uniquely positioned to deliver substantial free cash flow in 2023.

PFG, may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Principal Financial Group is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PFG in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.53 per share for PFG, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PFG, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.33%  heading into earnings season.Principal Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrincipal Financial Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrincipal Financial Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Principal Financial Group, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PFG has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Principal Financial Group, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

359,1019bec9-844b-3b10-a4a2-45f40c8b474b,AFL,2023-01-28,2 Top Rated Stocks to Consider Buying Before Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-top-rated-stocks-consider-005112248.html,1674867072,STORY,['AFL'],"[After several Big Tech and Big Oil stocks reported earnings this week, next week’s lineup will continue to feature a few well-known names among their respective sectors.Let’s take a look at two well-known companies that are currently top-rated Zacks stocks and set to give quarterly releases next week.Aflac AFLAflac (AFL) is a stock investors may want to consider. The insurance provider is in the Finance sector and is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, February 1.Aflac is a viable investment out of the top-rated Insurance-Accident and Health Industry, which is currently in the top 12% of over 250 Zacks Industries. Sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) earnings estimate revisions are trending higher for fiscal year 2023 despite a slight dip in FY22 estimates.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview:  Aflac’s Q4 earnings are expected at $1.21 per share, which would be -5% dip from Q4 2021. This would round out fiscal year 2022 EPS at $5.25, an -11% drop from FY21 but FY23 earnings are projected to continue the company’s solid bottom line growth and rise 3% to $5.43 a share.Q4 sales are projected to be $4.49 billion, down -17% from the prior year quarter. Total sales are expected to decline -13% in FY22 and fall another -4% in FY23 to $18.32 billion. Still, the expected rise in earnings in FY23 with estimates also going up is a great sign that Aflac is managing operating costs effectively during the broader economic slowdown.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates that Aflac could top bottom-line estimates for Q4 with the Most Accurate Estimate at $1.23 per share and the Zacks Consensus having EPS at $1.21.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Topping Q4 bottom line expectations could help Aflac stock rally and it looks quite possible that the company may be able to provide positive guidance with fiscal 2023 earnings estimate revisions trending higher.Story continuesPlus, the market has appeared to be okay with the slight dip in Aflac’s top line due to the stability in earnings despite the challenging operating environment as ALF stock is up +17% over the last year to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500’s -9%.McDonald’s MCD Another household name that investors may want to consider buying before its Q4 earnings report on Tuesday, January 31 is McDonald’s (MCD) out of the Retail and Wholesale sector.McDonald’s stock has been able to outperform the broader market over the last year with the company being a more affordable fast food option for consumers amid higher inflation. This looks set to continue with the famous burger chain also sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as earnings estimates are slightly up for the current quarter, fiscal 2022, and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 Preview: McDonald’s Q4 EPS is expected at $2.45, up 10% from Q4 2021. Even better, this would round FY22 earnings at $9.93, an 7% YoY increase with FY23 EPS projected to rise another 6%. Fourth quarter sales are forecasted to be $5.70 billion, down -5% from the prior year quarter. Total sales would be down -1% for FY22 but are projected to rise 4% in FY23 to $23.86 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ESP: McDonald’s is expected to slightly miss bottom-line expectations with the Zacks Consensus for Q4 earnings at $2.45 a share and the Most Accurate Estimate having EPS at $2.44.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeaway: Despite the possibility of missing Q4 bottom-line expectations, the rising earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 is a good sign that McDonald’s could offer stronger guidance in their outlook for the year. This could continue to intrigue investors, with MCD stock up +6% over the last year to largely outperform the benchmark.Bottom Line Both McDonald’s and Aflac stock could continue to outperform the broader market this year and the guidance in their Q4 reports will be a larger indicator of such. Despite the slowing top-line growth in these well-known companies’ investors may want to consider buying their stocks as management has shown the ability to make the best of the tougher operating environment and challenging economy as indicated in the bottom line stability.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

360,d0a3df52-36cc-3db3-9c3e-d32b0a2635ea,AFL,2023-01-28,7 Undervalued Income Stocks to Buy in January,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-undervalued-income-stocks-buy-210415831.html,1674594255,STORY,"['SNA', 'UMC', 'AFL', 'PSX', 'SWK', 'BTI', 'RHI']","[Although the wild volatility of 2022 delivered some tempting market ideas for the new year, investors should also make some room for undervalued income stocks to buy. Fundamentally, dividend-paying enterprises offer tremendous relevancies because they help keep your portfolio right side up. And because of last year’s downpour, investors can scoop up quality names for cheap.Moving forward, it’s possible that the Federal Reserve could ease off its monetary tightening policy or perhaps slash interest rates. Such an action would likely spark upside mobility in risk-on asset classes, thereby rewarding growth-oriented enterprises. However, this projection isn’t guaranteed, which is why undervalued income stocks to buy remain intriguing.Besides, hurtling toward another ambiguous environment, anything can happen. You can mitigate some of the unpleasantries with the undervalued income stocks to buy listed below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRHIRobert Half$79.24AFLAFLAC$72.68SNASnap-on$241.17UMCUnited Microelectronics$7.84SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$87.69PSXPhillips 66$106.95BTIBritish American Tobacco$38.22Robert Half (RHI)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comUnder strained market environments such as the present juncture, you must take what Wall Street gives you. For instance, one of the hot topics – that’s actually a downer – in the economy right now is mass layoffs. With many high-paying white-collar jobs suffering the corporate axe, the resumes will start flying. Invariably, in my view, this circumstance should benefit the employment services agency Robert Half (NYSE:RHI).To be sure, RHI hasn’t enjoyed a great performance in the market. In the trailing year, shares dropped over 27% in equity value. Nevertheless, it’s one of the undervalued income stocks to buy. Again, the fundamental backdrop favors Robert Half. Increasingly, we may see rising desperation among white-collar workers, thus driving demand for the company’s services.Story continuesFinancially, the market prices RHI at nearly 13 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median stands at 15.8 times. As well, the company enjoys strong profitability metrics and a decently stable balance sheet. Though Robert Half’s forward yield of 2.16% isn’t anything to write home about, it’s also a very dependable payout.AFLAC (AFL)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA specialist in the field of supplemental insurance, AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) represents a boring business. Still, boring businesses tend to make solid candidates for undervalued income stocks to buy. Moreover, the wild events of the coronavirus pandemic will likely support rising demand for Aflac’s protective solutions.Essentially, the Covid-19 crisis forced Americans (and citizens of other privileged nations) to pop their delusional bubbles. No longer will once-in-a-century pandemics remain the exclusive domain of the foreign and exotic. Instead, Covid-19 made us all realize that the smelly stuff can roll downhill very quickly. And while we can’t do much about random catastrophes, we can protect ourselves financially.Aside from a great story, AFL objectively ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices Aflac shares at a trailing multiple of 9.13. For comparison, the sector median stands at 12.83 times.Finally, Aflac carries a forward yield of 2.35%. No, it’s not the most generous yield but it’s a reliable payout. Indeed, the company features 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases.Snap-on (SNA)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockAnother arguably boring idea, Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) probably doesn’t get much airtime. However, that could change soon. With the Biden administration focused on repairing and revamping the nation’s various infrastructure networks, Snap-on could soar in relevance. Per the company’s public profile, it manufactures and markets high-end tools and equipment for professional use in the transportation industry.While so many publicly traded securities stumbled in 2022, SNA did largely the opposite. In the trailing year, Snap-on gained over 13% of equity value. Further, in the company’s most recent third-quarter earnings report, it topped earnings and revenue estimates. Interestingly, analysts rate SNA a consensus moderate buy. And their average price target implies an upside potential of over 15%.Currently, the market prices SNA at both a trailing and forward multiple of 14.5. For both metrics, Snap-on trades conspicuously below the sector median multiple. Lastly, the company carries a forward yield of 2.71%. Thus, from a relevancy and dividend standpoint, SNA represents one of the undervalued income stocks to buy in January.United Microelectronics (UMC)dividend stocks: A calculator projecting the word ""DIVIDEND"" rests on a pile of gold and silver coins.Source: ShutterstockDue to the severe global supply chain disruption impacting the broader technology space, it’s no surprise that semiconductor firm United Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) suffered steep losses in 2022. In the trailing year, UMC gave up nearly 27% of equity value. That said, modern societies always move forward. Therefore, UMC could make for an interesting pickup among undervalued income stocks to buy.Indeed, the rest of the markets seem to think so. Since the January opener, UMC stormed out of the gates to a nearly 21% upside performance. Currently, Wall Street analysts rate United as a consensus moderate buy. Additionally, their average price target implies a 24% upside potential from here on out. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, UMC also enjoys very positive sentiment among hedge funds.As well, the market prices shares at 9.7-times forward earnings, well below the sector median of 18.6 times. Further, United benefits from a strong balance sheet and excellent profit margins. Its forward yield of 3.59% represents the icing on the cake. It’s easily one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)7 Safe Dividend Stocks for Investors to Buy Right NowSource: ShutterstockArguably, when most people look for ideas to invest in, manufacturers of power tools don’t come readily to mind. However, with the aforementioned Biden administration pushing its infrastructure-building initiatives, Stanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) could enjoy upside success. Notably, analysts from Data Bridge Market Research project that the power tools market could reach a valuation of $51.45 billion. If so, this would represent a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2021.To be fair, the market hasn’t been friendly to SWK. In the trailing year, shares plunged more than 50%, which is horrendous, needless to say. However, investors appear to see incredible value in SWK now. Since the January opener, the underlying company gained over 16% of market value. To add more encouragement, hedge fund sentiment for the power tools specialist ranks as very positive.Right now, the market prices SWK at a trailing multiple of 9.7. This compares quite favorably against the sector median of 20.6 times. Finally, the company carries a forward yield of 3.62%, making it one of the undervalued income stocks to buy.Phillips 66 (PSX)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockAlthough I’m starting to go back to the well a bit too many times with Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), if you’re seeking undervalued income stocks to buy, it’s probably one of the best for more aggressive investors. Fundamentally, what’s attractive about the company centers on its downstream component of the energy value chain. Focusing on refining and marketing, it’s directly connected to where the economic rubber meets the road.In my estimation, there will be plenty of rubber meeting the same congested road soon. With major enterprises now demanding their remote workers to come back to the office, oil firms must be licking their lips. While worker bees might put up a fuss, under a recessionary environment, it’s wise to just toe the line. Otherwise, you could be on the unemployment line.Objectively, PSX ranks among the undervalued income stocks to buy based on its trailing multiple. Presently, the market prices shares at 4.9 times trailing earnings. In contrast, the sector median pings at 8.4 times. With a forward yield of 3.63%, it’s very difficult to ignore Phillips 66.British American Tobacco (BTI)7 Winning High-Yield Dividend Stocks With Payouts Over 5%Source: ShutterstockSaving the most controversial name on this list of undervalued income stocks to buy, agnostically-minded investors may want to consider British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI). Politically, socially and ideologically, the tobacco industry commands as much respect as a dental practice with no anesthesia. Still, British American is evolving with the market, particularly with its cleaner-profile vaping/e-cigarette products.Cynically, it’s also possible that the associated mental health pressures stemming from a recession may lead to an increased usage of adult liberties. I’m not just talking about “analog” cigarettes but also the increased use of vaping products. Based on the available evidence, vaping is less harmful than smoking but it’s not 100% safe.On the financial front, BTI makes a case for undervalued income stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.72. In contrast, the sector median stands at 12.2 times. Finally, British American offers a forward yield of 7.76%. That simply might be too tempting, even for conservative investors.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of Fourth Quarter 2022 results and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2023. With us on today's call are John Morikis, chairman and CEO; Al Mistysyn, CFO; Heidi Petz, President and COO; Jane Cronin, Senior Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Jim Jaye, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Issuer Direct via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes. This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under the U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters.Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Jim Jaye.Jim Jaye: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sherwin-Williams delivered strong fourth quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, including high single-digit percentage sales growth, significant year-over-year gross margin improvement, expanded adjusted operating margins in all three segments, strong double-digit diluted net income per share growth and strong EBITDA growth. Sales in our professional architectural end markets increased by a high-teens percentage. On the industrial side of the business, sales were up by double-digit percentages in North and Latin America, partially offset by softer conditions in Europe and Asia. From a cost perspective, year-over-year inflation remained significant in the quarter, but we are encouraged by a modest sequential decrease in raw material costs for the second quarter in a row.Story continuesAdditionally, we made solid progress on the targeted restructuring and cost reduction actions we announced on our last call, the results of which we expect to begin benefiting us in the first half of 2023. Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on customer solutions and executing on continuous improvement in business optimization activities. We also identified opportunities and prepared for what we currently expect will be a challenging operating environment in 2023. I'd like to highlight just a few of our consolidated fourth quarter numbers. Comparisons in my comments are to the prior year period unless stated otherwise. Starting with the top line. Fourth quarter 2022 consolidated net sales increased 9.8% to $5.23 billion. Consolidated gross margin increased to 42.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points.SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of sales decreased by 40 basis points to 29.8%. Excluding onetime costs related to our previously announced restructuring actions, gross margin improved sequentially to 42.9% in the fourth quarter of '22 from 42.8% in the third quarter of '22. And SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales decreased 110 basis points as compared to the prior year. Consolidated profit before tax increased $186 million or 60.2%. Diluted net income per share in the quarter was $1.48 per share versus $1.15 per share a year ago. Excluding Valspar acquisition-related amortization expense and costs related to previously announced restructuring actions, fourth quarter adjusted diluted net income per share increased 41% to $1.89 per share versus $1.34 a year ago.Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased $281 million or 52.7%. Let me now turn it over to Heidi, who will provide some commentary on our fourth quarter results by segment. John will follow Heidi with his comments on our full year 2022 results as well as our 2023 outlook before we move on to your questions.Heidi Petz: Thank you, Jim. I'll begin with the Americas Group, where sales increased 15.7% driven by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued effective pricing. Segment profit increased by $126.4 million and segment margin improved 210 basis points to 17.2%. Our pro architectural sales grew by a high teens percentage of the quarter, led by property management and followed by new residential, commercial and residential repaint, respectively. Sales in Protective &amp; Marine, DIY and Latin America, all increased by double digits, but were below the TAG segment guided range. From a product perspective, interior and exterior paint sales were both strong, with interior sales growing faster and representing a larger part of the mix.We opened 40 net new stores in the fourth quarter and a total of 72 net new stores in 2022. Moving on to our Consumer Brands Group. Sales decreased by 2.4% in the quarter, which was better than our guidance. Sales decreased due to lower volume sales and low single-digit FX headwinds, partially offset by price increases. Sales were slightly positive in North America and Europe, but more than offset by significant continued weakness in China due in large part to COVID-related lockdown. Customers managed their inventories as inflation continued to pressure DIY paint demand from consumers for this segment. Tightness in alkyd resin also impacted our ability to produce stains and aerosols. Adjusted segment margin was 11.3%, up 500 basis points year-over-year.We also made good progress in the quarter on the China architectural and aerosol restructuring actions that we described last quarter. The actions in the fourth quarter resulted in $25.6 million in onetime restructuring costs and a $15.5 million impairment charge. Sales in the Performance Coatings Group increased 4.2% and were driven by mid-teens pricing, partially offset by a low double-digit decrease in volume. Mid-single-digit sales from acquisitions were offset by a mid-single-digit unfavorable FX impact. Adjusted segment margin increased 530 basis points to 14.2% of sales. This is the third straight quarter that this team has delivered year-over-year segment margin improvement driven by execution of our strategy, including effective pricing actions.Sales in PCG varied significantly by region. In North America, sales increased double digits against a challenging comp. Latin America sale also increased by double digits against a strong comp. Sales in Europe decreased high-single-digits against a double-digit comparison and amidst continued economic slowing. Sales decreased by a low teens percentage in Asia against a double-digit comparison and as COVID lockdowns continued to impact demand. From a division perspective, Growth was strongest in coil, which was up by a low double-digit percentage, followed by auto refinish and general industrial, which were both up mid-single digits. Packaging was down low single digits driven by negative double-digit FX impact in Europe and Asia and against an extremely strong comparison last year of over 30%.We continue to feel very good about our packaging position and expect this to be a recession-resilient performer. Industrial wood was down low teens as the housing slowdown is impacting furniture, flooring and cabinetry market. Similar to Consumer Brands Group, Performance Coatings made good progress on its portion of the targeted restructuring actions that we described on our last call, resulting in $22.2 million in onetime costs in the quarter. With that, let me turn it to John for his comments on our full year results and our 2023 outlook.John Morikis: Thank you, Heidi, for that color on our fourth quarter segment results. I want to thank our teams for working hard to deliver a strong finish to the year. I'm particularly pleased with the significant adjusted profit margin improvement that all three segments delivered compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Our fourth quarter completed a strong year for Sherwin-Williams and I'd like to provide just a few high-level comments on our full year performance. On a consolidated basis, we delivered record sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted net income per share in 2022. We generated these results in a difficult operating environment, including relentless inflation, less-than-optimal raw material availability, a war in Europe and COVID lockdowns in China.Our people refused to be deterred by these challenges and continue to do what they do best, serve our customers. Our success stems from executing on our strategy, which remains unchanged. We provide differentiated solutions that enable our customers to increase their productivity and their profitability. These solutions center on industry and application expertise, innovation, value-added services and differentiated distribution. None of this happens without the determination and dedication of our greatest asset, the more than 61,000 employees of Sherwin-Williams. Together, this team grew full year consolidated sales by 11.1% to a record $22.1 billion. It was the 12th consecutive year we have grown the business. On a segment basis, the Americas Group delivered 12.9% sales growth and grew profit before tax $197.5 million.Our largest customer segment, residential repaint, grew by a double-digit percentage for the seventh year in a row. Sales in all other customer segments were also up by double digits for the year. Consumer Brand sales were down 1.1% for the year. Sales were up mid-single digits in North America, our largest region. This was more than offset by double-digit declines in Europe and China. Although the bottom line results weren't what we expected, 2022 was a transition year for Consumer Brands Group as they completed a number of restructuring and simplification efforts to position the business for long-term success and driving operating margins back to the high teens. Performance Coating sales were up 13.2% for the year against a 22% comparison.All divisions grew with the exception of industrial wood. It was down less than 1%. Adjusted segment margin expanded 250 basis points to 14.1% for the year as we continue to recover from the highest cost inflation in the company and pursue our high-teens margin target for this segment. Adjusted diluted net income per share increased 7.1% to a record $8.73 per share. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $3.61 billion or 16.3% of sales. Net operating cash for the year was $1.9 billion or 18.7% of sales. We returned a total of $1.5 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share buybacks in 2022. We invested $883 million to purchase 3.35 million shares at an average price of $263.64. We distributed $618.5 million in dividends, an increase of 5.4%.We also invested $644.5 million in our business through capital expenditures, including approximately $188 million for our building our future projects. We ended the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.9 times. Additionally, we invested $1 billion in acquisitions that accelerated our strategy. I'd also like to mention our ESG efforts where we continue to work toward meeting our longer-term targets. Newsweek, Forbes and other third parties once again recognized various aspects of our program. Throughout the year, we continue to execute on continuous improvement initiatives and targeted investments to drive growth, competitiveness, efficiency and profitability. We opened 72 new paint stores and hired 1,400 management trainees. We introduced multiple new products while reducing SKUs and formulations.We expanded production capacity and enhanced procurement and logistics processes. We also continued on our digital and sustainability journeys, and we executed on our acquisition strategy. I am confident we widened the gap between Sherwin-Williams and our competitors in 2022, and that's just what we intend to do again in 2023. So turning to our outlook. We enter 2023 with confidence, energy and a commitment to seize profitable growth opportunities wherever we find them. We have clarity of mission. We have the right strategy. We're focused on solutions for our customers. We're spending more time selling products and less time sourcing them, thanks to recovery in the supply chain. We're simplifying the business, and we're executing on targeted restructuring actions.We've made the right growth investments, and we'll continue to do so. We also have a portfolio that should be more resilient than in prior recessions. And above all, we've got the right people. We expect to outperform the market just as we have in the past. At the same time, we're not operating with our heads in the sand. We currently see a very challenging demand environment in 2023, and visibility beyond our first half is limited. The Fed has also been quite clear about its intention to slow down demand in its effort to tame inflation. These factors have not changed from what we communicated on our third quarter call and our base case in 2023 remains to prepare for the worst. Based on current indicators, we believe this is the most realistic outlook at this time.On the architectural side, it's no secret that U.S. housing will be under significant pressure this year. Single-family permits have been down year-over-year for 10 consecutive months, and single-family starts have been down year-over-year for eight consecutive months. Mortgage rates also remain elevated. As a result, we believe our new residential volume could be down anywhere from 10% to 20% this year. We expect our other PRO end markets to be more resilient than this, but there are headwinds in these areas, too. For example, existing home sales, which drive a portion of our repaint business have declined year-over-year for 16 straight months. Now while we see a backlog of new commercial construction, the Architectural Billing Index has contracted the last three months.On the DIY side, we expect inflation to continue putting pressure on consumer behavior in the U.S. and in Europe. On the industrial side, the PMI numbers for manufacturing in the U.S., Europe, China and Brazil have been negative for multiple months. We have already seen an industrial slowdown in Europe and the same is beginning to appear in the U.S. across several sectors. In China, COVID remains a wildcard and the trajectory of economic recovery is difficult to map. The U.S. housing slowdown will also impact some of our industrial businesses, namely industrial wood where we have already seen pressure and coil to some extent. Our team fully understands the importance of winning new accounts and growing share of wallet in this environment, and that is where we will be focused.From a cadence standpoint, we expect year-over-year sales and earnings performance will be significantly better in the first half than in our second half, driven by several factors. Our total company comparison will be much more favorable in the first half of 2023 as we delivered a very strong second half performance in 2022, where sales were up 13.8% and adjusted earnings per share grew by over 37%. As we've often said, volume is the key driver for operating leverage in our model. In the Americas Group, which is our largest and most profitable segment, our year-over-year volume comparisons are expected to be meaningfully better in the first half versus in the second half based on the trends we are currently seeing. We also expect more carryover price in the first half of 2023, which will have the full benefit of our September 6, 2022 price increase in TAG as well as prior price increases in the other two segments, all of which will annualize in the back half of this year.Additionally, we expect new residential sales will hold up better in our first half before very meaningful deceleration of demand in the back half of the year. Acquisitions will also be a tailwind in our first half as we expect incremental sales of approximately $140 million from transactions which closed after July 1 of last year. Given these factors and the softening demand environment, we believe our expectations for the back half of 2023 are tempered appropriately at this time. As you would expect, we will gain more clarity as the year progresses, and we will provide a more finally tuned view of our second half outlook during our second quarter conference call. As we said on our last call, we anticipated the demand environment would be challenging in 2023, leading us to get out ahead on cost management with the targeted restructuring we began in the fourth quarter.We estimate the annual savings from this effort to be in the $50 million to $70 million range, with about 75% realized by the end of 2023, and we are reaffirming those estimates today. Our outlook also assumes our raw material costs will be down by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in 2023 compared to 2022. We expect to see the largest benefit occurring in the second and third quarters. We expect to see decreases across many commodity categories, though the ranges likely will vary widely. From an availability standpoint, certain alkyd resins remain a pain point, impacting stains, aerosols and some industrial products. We expect supply of these resins to continue improving through the first half of the year, in part due to ramping of our own internal production.We expect other costs, including wages, energy and transportation to be up in the mid to high single-digit range. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will be flat to up by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to the first quarter of 2022, inclusive of a mid-single-digit price increase. Our sales expectations for the quarter by segment are included in our slide deck. For the full year 2023, we expect consolidated net sales to be flat to down mid-single digits, inclusive as a mid-single-digit price of carryover from 2022. Our sales expectations for the year by segment are included in our slide deck. We expect diluted net income per share for 2023 to be in the range of $6.79 to $7.59 per share. Full year 2023 earnings per share guidance includes acquisition-related amortization expense of approximately $0.81 per share and includes expense related to our previously announced targeted restructuring actions of approximately $0.25 to $0.35 per share.On an adjusted basis, we expect full year 2023 earnings per share in the range of $7.95 to $8.65. We provided a GAAP reconciliation in the Reg G table within our press release. Let me close with some additional data points and an update on our capital allocation priorities. Given carryover pricing, raw material deflation and our ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, we would expect full year gross margin expansion. We expect SG&amp;A as a percent of sales to increase in 2023. This is similar to the slowdown in 2008 and 2009, where we continue to invest in long-term solutions for our customers that allowed us to grow at a multiple of the market when demand normalized. We'll also control costs tightly in non-customer-facing functions and execute on our restructuring initiatives.We have a variety of SG&amp;A levers we can pull depending on a material change to our outlook up or down. We expect operating margin to modestly improve year-over-year, excluding restructuring and impairment costs and acquisition-related amortization expense. While we don't typically provide this level of color, we believe it is helpful to do so this year given the higher level of non-operating expenses impacting 2023. We expect to open between 80 to 100 new stores in the U.S. and Canada in 2023. We'll also be focused on sales reps, capacity and productivity improvements as well as systems and product innovation. We expect to complete the targeted restructuring actions we announced on our previous call, including the benefits and onetime costs we have outlined.We will continue to simplify and optimize the organization. The Latin American business of the Americas Group is now being managed and reported within the Consumer Brands Group. The change allows TAG leadership to focus more exclusively on its core U.S. and Canada stores business. While the Latin America architectural demand and service model are trending to be more in line with CBG's strategy. This business had sales of approximately $700 million in 2022. The change will be marginally accretive to TAG and marginally dilutive to CBG. You will see this change when we report first quarter results in April. Prior-year segment results will be restated at that time to reflect the change. The first quarter and full year guidance for 2023 we've communicated today does not reflect this change.Next month, at our Board of Directors meeting, we will recommend an annual dividend increase of 0.8% to $2.42 per share, up from $2.40 last year. If approved, this will mark the 45th consecutive year we've increased our dividend. We expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases. We do not have any long-term debt maturities due in 2023. However, we will reduce short-term debt to trend our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio towards the high end of our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times. We'll also continue to evaluate acquisitions that fit our strategy. In addition, I will refer you to the slide deck issued with our press release this morning, which provides guidance on our expectations for currency exchange, effective tax rate, CapEx, depreciation and amortization and interest expense.Given the many variables at play, limited visibility beyond the first half and the high level of uncertainty in the global economy, we believe our outlook is a realistic one. Our slide deck further outlines the assumptions underlying our guidance and is based on our current dialogue with customers and suppliers and our reading of numerous macro indicators. As we get through our first half and we see more information, those assumptions could change. If those assumptions change for the better, we would expect to do better than the guidance we are laying out today. While we can't defy gravity, we do expect to outperform the market and our competitors in 2023. I'm highly confident in our leadership team, which is deep and experienced and has been through many previous business cycles.We've transformed our business in many ways since the last significant downturn, and we are now a stronger and a more resilient company. We also know our guidance is clearly reflective of the market pressure we are experiencing. We anticipated 2023 would be challenging. We've planned accordingly. We have and will continue taking appropriate actions. We expect strong momentum coming out of this period of uncertainty, similar to prior downturns. That momentum will stem from our strategy of providing innovative solutions that help our customers to be more productive and more profitable. In challenging environments, like the current one, we can be an even more valuable partner to our customers, while we're also earning new ones. This concludes our prepared remarks.With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and we'll be happy to take your questions.See also 10 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy and 13 Cheap New Stocks To Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

It is worth considering Regeneron (REGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry.This biopharmaceutical company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.69%.For the last reported quarter, Regeneron came out with earnings of $11.14 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.70 per share, representing a surprise of 14.85%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $8.53 per share and it actually produced earnings of $9.77 per share, delivering a surprise of 14.54%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Regeneron, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Regeneron has an Earnings ESP of +4.30% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 3, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

371,31b28670-c1c2-30cd-a902-80eb2f41b08e,REGN,2023-01-28,Regeneron (REGN) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-regn-expected-beat-earnings-150003322.html,1674831603,STORY,['REGN'],"[Regeneron (REGN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis biopharmaceutical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -59.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.17 billion, down 36.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regeneron?For Regeneron, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.30%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Regeneron will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regeneron would post earnings of $9.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.14, delivering a surprise of +14.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regeneron appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, Gilead Sciences (GILD), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +115.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.58 billion, down 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Gilead has been revised 1.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.99%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Gilead will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders disposed of US$7.0m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-140018559.html,1674828018,STORY,['REGN'],"[In the last year, many Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, sold US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$742). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of Arthur Ryan's holding.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, currently worth about US$3.4b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insiders?The fact that there have been no Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders selling.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.Alicia Charity: Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions. Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website. On Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insights into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter earnings release, our 2021 annual report to shareholders and our 2021 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that, you'll see our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.Story continuesMany of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.James Cracchiolo: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise delivered a strong fourth quarter, completing an excellent year in 2022. We continue to navigate uncertainty and serve our clients exceptionally well. I'll give you an update on the business, and then Walter will discuss our financials. Let me start with the market environment. Equity markets were down 19% year-over-year, with the average equity markets down 3% sequentially. So far this year, we're starting to see markets rebound to some extent as inflation eases, However, inflation is still at a high level. The question is, will the Fed have to continue to raise rates a bit more? Or will they maintain higher rates for longer if inflation remains stickier?With that backdrop, Ameriprise continues to be in a strong position. Revenues were good at $3.6 billion, only down 2% from a year-ago relating to the impact of the equity and fixed income markets. Earnings were up nicely with EPS up 13% for the quarter and 11% for the year, both on new records, and ROE continued to be excellent among the best in the industry. Importantly, we're also managing expenses well with total expenses down 5% compared to a year-ago. Assets Under Management and Administration were down to $1.2 trillion largely driven by the steep decline in equity markets, lower fixed income markets and a difficult foreign currency translation and Asset Management. As in previous quarters, our combination of businesses generates a consistent level of free cash flow and good returns across market cycles.We're able to consistently invest in the business, which is strengthening our competitive position and our ability to deliver differentiated results. Now I'll talk more about our businesses. In Advice &amp; Wealth Management, we continue to deliver very strong results and build on our leadership positions. We had good client flows in the quarter as clients remained engaged working closely with their advisors and benefiting from our comprehensive advice and solutions. Total client flows for the quarter were more than $12 billion, which is very strong, and in fact, the second highest quarter we had and just below our record fourth quarter last year. And I'll highlight that client flows were a record for the year at nearly $43 billion. With the investment climate this year, we've seen an even split into the mix of flows into advisory and non-advisory accounts, which is appropriate in this environment.We're maintaining an appropriate level of cash balances with good growth in our certificate business and the Ameriprise Bank, which is a key growth area for us. With regard to the bank, we've been consistently investing to expand our capabilities. The bank provides important flexibility in this interest rate environment and enables us to further engage and deepen our relationships with clients. Our bank has grown more than 50% this year to nearly $19 billion. We have good growth in our pledged loan business, and we're on track to launch more deposit and lending-based products this year. Our certificate company has also grown to nearly $10 billion, up $4 billion for the year. Clearly, 2022 was a very challenging year for investors to navigate the market volatility.That's why our high level of engagement and advice is so important. Clients highlight the positive experience they're having with Ameriprise and our advisors. And that satisfaction leads to a strong level of trust, which we're being recognized for. And just recently, we ranked #2 for trust in 2022 in Forrester's new Financial Services Customer Trust Index, and that complements our Newsweek rating as one of America's most trusted companies last year. Let's look at advisor productivity, which also remained strong, up 4% to nearly $830,000 per advisors in a challenging market environment. One of the reasons our advisors are so productive as the level of support and tools we provide, we're making important investments, including our branding, marketing and integrated technology.We're helping advisors engage clients really well in driving growth in their practices. And for the fourth consecutive year, Ameriprise was recognized by J.D. Power for providing outstanding customer service experience for phone support for advisors. Turning to recruiting. We had another good quarter with 72 highly productive advisors joining the firm. advisors are attracted to our value proposition and the strength and stability of the firm, and the pipeline looks good. So overall, we are consistently investing in the business, including the bank, which is helping to drive organic growth and continue to generate strong results. Advice &amp; Wealth Management continue to drive the firm's results with earnings up 41% year-over-year. Now let's turn to Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions, where earnings were up 25% in the quarter due to the improved rate environment and our ability to invest out.As part of our strategy, we focused on products that meet our risk tolerances. Overall, sales were down consistent with the industry. We're very much focused on variable annuities without living benefits, our structured products of variable universal life and DI products given our move away from fixed products. This business is very stable and delivers a very good cash flow and returns. I'd note that RiverSource was recently ranked as one of the most profitable life insurers. Now I'll cover Asset Management. 2022 was a tough year when navigating the volatility as we focused on our clients and execute our strategic priorities. Similar to the industry, our Asset Management business faced significant headwinds due to markets depreciating in the U.S. and globally, which pressured earnings.Equity markets were down 19%. With this, assets under management were down 23% to $584 billion, driven by market declines as well as a negative FX impact. Overall flows in the quarter were $0.4 billion out that included $1.7 billion of legacy insurance partner outflows. In retail, overall, we were in net outflows of $3.7 billion, including reinvested dividends, which were driven by the weak market conditions that both pressured gross sales and increased redemptions. In addition, in the U.S., we believe there was a heightened level of tax loss selling in December. Turning to Global Institutional, we were in net inflows of $5 billion, excluding legacy insurance partners with some nice wins in LDI strategies. With regard to investment performance, we continue to have solid three, five and 10-year numbers.However, we have weakness in one year's numbers given market volatility. In Asset Management, we are maintaining our expense discipline while continuing to invest in long-term priorities. They include our investment research, alternatives, responsible investment, globalizing our operations and BMO integration, which is on track. We have a strong lineup of products and capabilities, a clear focus on serving our clients. And as the environment improves, we will be well situated. Overall, Ameriprise is in a position of strength entering 2023, and we're very much focused on engaging our clients and continuing to execute well in this environment. And with the strength and diversification of our business, including the growth of the bank, we continue to be able to invest across the firm, while continuing to return capital to shareholders at a differentiated level.In the fourth quarter alone, we returned $610 million to shareholders. I'll turn it over to Walter, and then we'll take your questions.Walter Berman: Thank you, Jim. Results this quarter were very strong, and we continue to demonstrate the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition. Adjusted EPS increased 13% to $6.94 in the quarter and increased 11% for the full-year. Our diversified business mix supports good performance across market cycles, which was certainly demonstrated in the quarter. Fundamentals &amp; Wealth Management, particularly in its cash businesses were very strong. In total, Wealth Management now represents 64% of adjusted operating earnings up from 48% a year ago. Asset Management, like the industry, is facing substantial headwinds and earnings from this segment declined in the quarter. And the Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions business continues to generate solid financial results and free cash flow.We remain focused on the aspects of the business that we can control. We are executing our priorities, including investing for profitable business growth, expanding the bank and completing the integration of BMO all while meeting and exceeding client needs and maintaining a disciplined approach to managing expenses. In fact, total expenses, excluding BMO, were flat for the year. Our balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remains strong. In the quarter, we returned $610 million of capital to shareholders, totaling $2.4 billion for the full-year, while continuing to grow the bank and certificate company. We have dedicated significant capital to grow these businesses. Let's turn to Slide 6. As you would expect in these markets, Assets Under Management and Administration ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, down 17%.This was driven by depreciating markets with equity and fixed markets down 19% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, Asset Management AUM levels were impacted by the weakening of the pound and the euro, with 36% of Asset Management AUM outside the U.S. at the end of the year. Despite the lower AUMA levels, operating net revenues declined only 2% to $3.6 billion as a result of higher interest earnings and pretax earnings reached a new high of $973 million reflecting the diversified revenue dynamics I discussed, coupled with the excellent expense discipline. Let's turn to Advice &amp; Wealth Management on Slide 7. Wealth Management continues to deliver strong organic growth and business momentum, a reflection of our differentiated value proposition.With the challenging market backdrop, clients' assets declined 12% to $758 billion in 2022. However, we have sustained growth of 4% over the past two years. Total client net flows remain very strong at over $12 billion in the quarter and reached a record $43 billion for the full-year. While we continue to see a solid level of flows into ARAP accounts. There has been a distinct pickup in flows going to brokerage accounts and certificates as clients navigate the market backdrop. Revenue per advisor reached $827,000, up 23% over the past two years from continued enhanced productivity and business growth. On Slide 8, you can see Wealth Management profitability was exceptional, up 41% and reached a record margin of 30% as strong organic growth and higher interest earnings exceeded pressure from market depreciation and lower transactional activity.Adjusted operating expenses declined 5% with distribution expenses down 10%, reflecting lower transactional activity and lower client assets. G&amp;A increased 11% in the quarter. And for the full-year, G&amp;A grew 8%. Expense growth in the quarter was driven by continued investments in the bank and higher volume-related activity from strong organic growth. Additionally, the prior year included unusually low expenses relating to staff levels and T&amp;A. Cash balances in the quarter increased year-over-year and sequentially to $47 billion, which included $10 billion of certificate balances. Cash rebalances have declined slightly, bringing it closer to historic levels. However, certificates have grown 76% year-over-year as clients are laddering liquidity to garner higher yields.FinanceAs a complement to our certificate offering, we are continuing to build out our savings and deposit products in the bank this year to meet the growing client appetite for yield. As a reminder, the majority of our clients sweep cash balances are working cash accounts with the average account size being only $8,000 and constituting over 60% of our total cash balances. And our operating rates continue to remain competitive with continuous benchmarking against the industry. This has translated into higher interest earnings in the quarter. The gross fee yield in the quarter reached 373 basis points, up 300 basis points from the prior year and over 100 basis points sequentially with bank and certificates driving most of it. The bank ended the year with assets of $19 billion with additional capacity to grow further.This provides flexibility to capture the benefits of rising entries by investing in high-quality, longer duration securities. These investments will create sustainable multiple year benefits regardless of interest rate changes over that period. New mine purchases in the quarter were approximately 250 basis points above the spreads from worth balance sheet cash. This has been supplemented with strong growth within our certificate company with assets growing to nearly $10 billion in the quarter and a gross fee yield of nearly 400 basis points. As we move into 2023, we are on a trajectory to generate growth in interest earnings from the bank and grown on our incremental yield, while continuing to maintain high credit quality. In the first half of the year, we were moving $3 billion on to the bank's balance sheet.We expect to transfer additional balances in the back half of 2023. And as we previously indicated, we will reinvest approximately $3 billion of maturities into our yielding assets throughout the course of the year. Let's turn to Asset Management on Slide 9. In 2022, the backdrop remained challenging for both us and the industry. AUM and was $584 billion, down 23%. This decrease was driven by double-digit equity and fixed income market depreciation as well as negative pound and euro foreign exchange impacts. Flows during the period remained challenged as global institutional net inflows during 2022 were more than offset by ongoing retail pressure. As a reminder, 2021 net flows benefited from the $17 billion BMO U.S. asset transfer, which had limited impact in 2022.On Slide 10, you can see asset manage financials reflect the continuation of the challenging market environment and reflect deleveraging that occurs in this business. Earnings were $146 million, a 56% decline as a result of market depreciation and net outflows. In addition, the prior year period included $35 million in performance fees, while the current quarter only included $5 million as well as $12 million of unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments. As a result, margin in the quarter declined to 29%. Importantly, we are focused on the areas we can control and on executing our strategic priorities. Expenses remain well managed, total expenses were down 12% with G&amp;A and other expenses down from continued expense disciplines, lower performance fee compensation and timing of mark-to-market expenses.As a reminder, results last year include a partial quarter of BMO-related expenses. As we move forward, we will continue to make market-driven trade-offs and discretionary spending and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly based on the revenue environment. Let's turn to Slide 11. Retirement &amp; Protection Solutions earnings increased 25% with strong cash flow generation and a clearly differentiated risk profile. Results in the quarter were driven by enhanced yield from repositioning of the investment portfolio, lower deferred acquisition cost amortization and lower sales levels. We remain well capitalized with an estimated RBC ratio of 545% at year-end. Consistent with the industry, sales in the quarter declined as a result of the volatile market environment as well as the impact from our actions to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits.Now only $43 billion of account value is in products with living benefit guarantees, a $14 billion decline from past year. Protection sales remain concentrated in higher margin asset accumulation VUL, which represents one-third of total insurance in-force assets. The increase in investment income was a direct result of the actions taken to reposition the investment portfolio. In the quarter, we repositioned $600 million primarily into longer-duration corporate bonds, while maintaining a high-quality portfolio. These actions will generate higher investment income in 2023. On Slide 12, our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified AA-rated investment portfolio is well positioned. During the quarter, new money purchases were AA+ rated at yields that were accretive to the overall portfolio.Despite continued market volatility in the quarter, VA hedging effectiveness remained very strong at 97%, and excess capital and holding company liquidity remains strong. Our diversified business model generates significant and stable free cash flow. This enables the company to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders, while continuing to invest for growth. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.6 million shares returning a total of $610 million of capital to shareholders, bringing the total for the year to $2.4 billion. Our capital return strategy over the past five years has reduced our share count by 28%. With that, we'll take your questions.See also 12 Cheap Monthly Dividend Stocks To Buy and 15 Countries that Produce the Most Wind Energy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"
