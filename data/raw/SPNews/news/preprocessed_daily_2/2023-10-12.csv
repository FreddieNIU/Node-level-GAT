However, escalating tensions in the Middle East continued to remain an overhang. Against such a backdrop, small-cap ETFs seem a prudent choice.While there are many options available in this space to tap the strong trend, investors should consider ETFs having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF IJR, Vanguard Small-Cap ETF VB, Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF SCHA, Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF VTWO and SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 600 Small Cap ETF SPSM could be solid plays.Why Small-Caps?The bouts of latest data suggest the economy is on a strong foothold. The International Monetary Fund raised the U.S. growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 2.1% for this year and by 0.5 percentage points to 1.5% for the next. As small-cap companies are more domestically tied, these are poised to outperform when the economy improves (read: 3 Sector ETFs &amp; Stocks to Bet on Upbeat September Jobs Data). The dovish comments from two Fed officials signaled that the recent surge in bond yields could lead to the tightening in credit conditions that the central bank is looking for. This could pave the way for policymakers to call an end to raising rates in this cycle, according to some analysts. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that the U.S. central bank does not need to raise interest rates any further, and that he sees no recession ahead. This has pushed Treasury yields lower, leading to risk-on trade. According to CME's FedWatch tool, traders put the chance of interest rates remaining unchanged in November and December at 87% and around 71%, respectively.Further, small-cap stocks are considered safer and better plays if political issues or economic turmoil creep into the picture as the pint-sized stocks generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. A surprise severe attack on Israel by Palestinian militants, Hamas, last weekend has deepened political uncertainty across the Middle East, thereby driving the appeal for small-cap stocks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned of an impending ""long and difficult war.” The attack marked the deadliest offensive in 50 years (read: Defense ETFs Spike on Middle East Tensions).Story continuesETFs to BuyWe have profiled the abovementioned ETFs here:iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR)iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF offers exposure to U.S. small-cap stocks and follows the S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index. iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF holds 646 stocks in its basket, with none accounting for more than 0.7% of assets.

Gen Z workers (21 – 26 years old) want to retire at age 61, but 99% say they are facing obstacles to saving for a comfortable retirement, a nine percent increase over last year and higher compared to 88% of Millennials, 91% of Gen X and 86% of Boomers. Inflation (54%), keeping up with monthly expenses (35%), and paying for unexpected expenses (31%) are among Gen Z’s top obstacles. Gen Z is also the most likely to say financial stress has impacted their ability to do their job (26%), followed closely by Millennials (22%), while Gen X (15%) and Boomers (10%) report a much lower impact.""Younger workers are still finding their financial footing in an economic environment that is challenging for everyone. They are just starting out, so it’s no surprise that they may feel greater financial pressure, especially with such an ambitious timeline to retirement,"" said Brian Bender, Head of Schwab Workplace Financial Services. ""However, saving for retirement and paying the bills doesn’t need to be an ‘either/or’ situation. You can work toward multiple financial goals at once. This is especially important for younger workers to remember as student loan payments resume and become yet another monthly expense for many.""Despite the financial challenges that younger workers are facing, they are more willing than older workers to forgo a salary raise for better benefits or more flexible work arrangements, such as a hybrid or remote setting or more flexible hours.Willingness to Forgo Salary Raise For…Better BenefitsMore Flexible Work ArrangementGen Z86%76%Millennials74%67%Gen X60%49%Boomers50%29%Managing financial stressMore than half of all workers say that their employer did something in the past year that helped them manage their financial stress. Gen Z (71%) is the most likely to say that their employer took steps to help in the form of increased pay (31%), increased 401(k) match (25%), increased current employee benefits (23%), additional bonus (19%), decreased hours for better work-life balance (17%), and new employee benefits (15%).Story continues""It’s great that employers are already playing such a big role in helping workers manage financial stress,"" said Marci Stewart, Director of Communications Consulting and Participant Education at Schwab Workplace Financial Services. ""Employers should continue to focus on areas that are challenging workers the most when it comes to financial wellness and retirement saving. That can go a long way toward helping to boost retention and slow job hopping among younger workers.""Gen Z - The Advice GenerationMore than any other generation, Gen Z workers think their financial situation warrants advice from a professional (Gen Z (62%) vs. Millennials (56%), Gen X (56%), and Boomers (52%)). Specifically, they would like more personalized 401(k) advice as almost half are not sure what investments to choose for their 401(k). Gen Z is also much more likely than older workers to want more help managing their current expenses to save more for retirement (Gen Z (41%) vs. Millennials (31%), Gen X (26%), and Boomers (14%)).I would like personalized investment advice for my 401(k)I don’t know what investments to choose for my 401(k)Gen Z83%Gen Z48%Millennials78%Millennials38%Gen X75%Gen X36%Boomers62%Boomers28%Gen Z is already tapping into several sources for advice more proactively than their older peers – 98% say they are currently seeking financial advice from at least one source, compared to 81% of Millennials, 82% of Gen X, and 85% of Boomers. Over half (52%) are asking family and friends for advice. They are also accessing advice through their 401(k) plan provider (37%), employer (31%), financial advisor (30%), and social media (28%).The survey also found Gen Z (75%) and Millennials (66%) are comfortable asking AI tools for help with financial planning, but adoption is still very low across generations (Gen Z (9%), Millennials (8%), Gen X (3%) and Boomers (2%)). Gen Z and Millennials are more likely to follow recommendations from a human financial professional than a computer, but they are more open to both types of advice overall than their older peers.I am likely to follow recommendations from a human financial professionalI am likely to follow computer-generated recommendationsGen Z97%Gen Z87%Millennials97%Millennials85%Gen X95%Gen X74%Boomers93%Boomers61%""It’s encouraging that younger workers are so open to different sources of human and digital advice, and that they are actively seeking it out,"" said Stewart. ""When workers engage, that’s when a professional can really help them with decision-making and financial next steps. We know having a plan in place boosts employee confidence and can lead to better outcomes.""About the surveyThis online survey of 1,000 U.S. 401(k) plan participants was conducted by Logica Research between April 19 and May 2, 2023. Survey respondents were actively employed by companies with at least 25 employees, were 401(k) plan participants and were 21-70 years old. Survey respondents include participants served by approximately 15 different retirement plan providers. All data is self-reported by study participants and is not verified or validated. In order to analyze Gen Z results against other generations, an additional 100 plan participants aged 21 to 26 completed the survey.

Following a ""relatively slower period"" in front-line releases, the firm sees a number of reasons to become incrementally more optimistic in the company's near- and medium-term path forward.BofA upgraded PNC Financial (PNC) to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $121 as part of a broader research note on U.S. Banks. The company's relative capital positioning is a significant positive, which should allow PNC to capture market share opportunities, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Signature's loan portfolio, the firm says.Goldman Sachs upgraded Shoals Technologies (SHLS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $28, up from $27, implying 85% upside from current levels. The firm is ""tactically more bullish,"" saying the overhang from recent warranty expense issues appear to be priced into the shares.B. Riley upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $51, up from $37.

The firm has concerns around 2024 networking spend and says Arista's valuation is reflecting a more balanced risk/reward profile at these levels.Raymond James downgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $520, down from $600. The firm believes the stock's significant outperformance year-to-date sets up a more balanced risk/reward scenario relative to historical levels.BofA downgraded Timken (TKR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $74, down from $100, as the firm sees a ""no pain, no gain"" theme as it looks towards 2024 in its Machinery, E&amp;C and Waste coverage.JPMorgan downgraded RXO Inc.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.7%.Revenues are expected to be $2.92 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.26% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $2.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.17, delivering a surprise of +4.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.State Street Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.18 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -15.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.32 billion, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 0.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.26%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

10,33acea63-efa0-3cc8-8401-fcad571e99f3,USB,2023-10-12,Investors in U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) have unfortunately lost 24% over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-u-bancorp-nyse-usb-120039036.html,1697112039,STORY,['USB'],"[For many, the main point of investing is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. So we wouldn't blame long term U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 38% over a half decade. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 12% in thirty days.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years over which the share price declined, U.S. Bancorp's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 1.9% each year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 9% per year, over the period. This implies that the market was previously too optimistic about the stock. The low P/E ratio of 9.30 further reflects this reticence.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on U.S. Bancorp's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 5 years was -24%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in U.S. Bancorp had a tough year, with a total loss of 17% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 20%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with U.S. Bancorp , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

The company has topped estimates by 16.97%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, CF was expected to post earnings of $2.15 per share, but it reported $2.70 per share instead, representing a surprise of 25.58%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.63 per share, while it actually produced $2.85 per share, a surprise of 8.37%.For CF, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history.

Interest rates were low. Money was available.”Although he said there is still some good news on the financial front, namely low unemployment rates and higher wages, an accumulation of pressures point to a slow-down in consumer spending. What factors are to blame?1. High Interest RatesWhen interest rates rise, money becomes more expensive to borrow, which often leads to a tightening of spending. This hasn’t necessarily happened in the past year, as consumers continue borrowing on their revolving credit lines and dipping into savings to afford what they want.But Simon said he sees that shifting now, with consumers becoming “wary.”Likewise, economists at Interactive Brokers have predicted consumer spending is set to decelerate sharply this fall. “Consumer sentiment has also been weakening during the last three months, signaling that consumers may be nearing the end of their shopping spree,” wrote IB’s senior economist Jose Torres. Story continues2. InflationInflation may finally begin to impact consumer spending habits. Simon pointed out that Amazon and other retailers advertised their recent sales in the form of percentage points, rather than the actual cost of a product. “You use percentages when you’re not real proud of your price point. I think you’ve got inflation pushing the relative price points up,” he told CNBC.3. Student Loan RepaymentsMeanwhile, the return of student loan payments for as many as 44 million borrowers may see many American households tightening their purse strings to afford payments. The average student loan payment is between $200 and $299 monthly, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data.In an economic landscape of rising prices across the board, that $200 or more will put a pinch in many Americans’ budgets.4. Global TensionsAfter Hamas attacked Israel, launching the region into war, it emphasized the overall global instability right now. Simon mentioned global tensions as another factor making American consumers uneasy right now. 5. Political ContentionAn upcoming U.S. election that promises to be “contentious,” as Simon said, as well as the government’s failure to pass a budget or even elect a new Speaker of the House, adds to the economic uncertainty in the U.S.Final NoteIn recent years, retailers have launched big sales in the fall as an early kick-off to the holiday shopping season. While July’s Amazon Prime Day 2023 was the largest sales day in the company’s history, it remains to be seen if this week’s sales will stack up.Will spending slow just in time for the holiday season or can consumers keep up the pace into 2024?More From GOBankingRates10 Best Cheap Gym Memberships10 of the Most Valuable Pennies3 Ways to Recession Proof Your RetirementIRS Collection Notices: 4% of Americans Fear 'Catastrophic Financial Stress'This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Walmart CEO Warns Consumers Can’t Keep Up With Inflation — 5 Economic Factors To Blame]"

Employees answer questions about their workload, whether they can balance all tasks, and what else is happening in their lives. Tracy Layney, executive vice president and CHRO, said it’s also important for executives to discuss their mental health candidly.“I talk pretty openly about my own challenges with mental health, and other leaders do too,” she said. “By doing that, we do destigmatize.""Levi Strauss also partnered with Lyra Health, a mental health services provider, instead of sticking with a traditional employee assistance program. With Lyra, employees get access to 17 sessions with a professional annually, a benefit the apparel company expanded to all global employees on Tuesday.“All of our 20,000 employees, wherever they sit in the world, in places where there may be even less access to mental health resources than we have here in the States, have access to this,” said Layney.Etsy collaborates with its mental health ERG.“Our mental health ERG…is probably one of the more active ERGs that I've ever seen anywhere. And the conversations that happen on these calls, in these meetings, are extraordinary,” said CHRO Kim Seymour, adding that it helps her understand the expectations of her younger workers.“We admire the fact that they will set their boundaries, and they're not playing around about it,” she said. Collaborating with ERGs to understand employee sentiment also helps the e-commerce company act on shared concerns and be transparent about how it's supporting employees based on acquired data. “I think that has been a game changer,"" said Seymour.Story continuesWalmart uses AiRCare to support at-risk employees.The retail giant uses AiRCare, a mental and behavioral health platform, to help at-risk employees get help when needed. The platform uses privatized data to reach individuals with high-risk factors proactively.“We've directly received notification of individuals that were literally ready to end their lives, that were contacted by a professional, that got into counseling,” says Donna Morris, Walmart’s executive vice president and chief people officer.Accenture prioritizes four determinants of mental health at work.Accenture’s focus on employee mental health is part of its “net better off” people strategy, where the professional services firm looks at four key factors:–Whether employees are physically, emotionally, and financially well.–Whether employees feel connected and have a sense of belonging.–Whether employees think their daily work is purposeful.–Whether employees are building market-relevant skills.“If you can fire on all four of those dimensions, you unlock two-thirds of an individual's potential at work,” said Ellyn Shook, Accenture’s chief leadership and human resources officer. But she also thinks executives should shift their perspective from mental health to mental wellness.“If you could get ahead of the mental health issues that people are experiencing, you can really change the course of people's lives, [and] of company outcomes,” she added.Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) has a market capitalization of $22.245 billion.Aristotle Capital Value Equity Strategy made the following comment about Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL), the water equipment and services supplier, was the largest detractor for the quarter. After closing the transformational acquisition of Evoqua in May 2023, long‐time CEO Patrick Decker announced he would retire at the end of 2023 and COO Matthew Pine will step into the top position. Concurrently, Xylem announced a change in its CFO, with William Grogan joining from IDEX Corporation where he served as CFO since 2017. While C‐suite turnover is not desirable, it is inevitable. Moreover, we see the company’s succession planning as well thought out and well executed. Meanwhile, Xylem reported double‐digit increases in revenue across all segments and end markets amid strong global demand from public utilities, as well as industrial, commercial and residential clients, that seek solutions to treat, test, transport and preserve water. We believe Xylem’s portfolio of highly differentiated pumps, recognized for their quality and critical uses, as well as the company’s ability to cross‐sell and link other products such as sensors and smart meters, will make it a one‐stop shop for utilities and protect the company from pure price competition. In our opinion, long‐term trends, such as water scarcity and the need to replace aging water infrastructure, create strong underlying demand for Xylem’s products through various parts of the economic cycle. We will evaluate the announced management transitions and will closely monitor the company's ongoing integration of Evoqua.Story continuesA technician wearing a protective suit in a water treatment plant.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MCHP. Click here to check it out. MCHP 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MCHPAs of 2023-10-11, Microchip Technology Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $109.64. It's currently trading at a price of $80.78. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 26.32%. The company is modestly undervalued.Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Microchip Technology IncThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microchip Technology Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$4.32GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.55%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 16.90% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=58.07Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=51.57Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=109.64Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $161.38. This valuation indicates that the Microchip Technology Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 49.94%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Per the preliminary data released by the market research firm, PC shipments in the July-September 2023 quarter plunged 9% year over year to 64.3 million units.Q3 Data Shows Signs of StabilizationThe third-quarter shipment data shows a strong improvement from the second quarter when PC vendors had shipped 59.7 million units. The sequential improvement in PC shipments can be seen as an initial sign of stabilization in the PC market.Mikako Kitagawa, the Director Analyst at Gartner, stated, “There is evidence that the PC market’s decline has finally bottomed out.” She further noted, “Vendors also made consistent progress towards reducing PC inventory, with inventory expected to return to normal by the end of 2023, as long as holiday sales do not collapse.”Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnComputer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnComputer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % ReturnIn 2020 and 2021, PC manufacturers had benefited from the increased demand amid the pandemic-induced remote-working and online learning wave. The pandemic necessitated using PC systems for remote work, web-based learning, video conferencing, video gaming, social media, consumer entertainment and streaming or online shopping.However, consumers have become more cautious about their spending due to inflationary pressure, rising interest rates and fears of a possible recession. Furthermore, enterprises are delaying their large IT spending amid macroeconomic challenges.Vendor-Wise PerformancePer the data compiled by Gartner, all top vendors, except HP Inc. HPQ, registered a decline in their PC shipments in the third quarter. HP Inc. delivered 13.53 million PCs in the third quarter, reflecting a 6.4% increase from the year-ago quarter.Apple AAPL registered the steepest decline, with PC shipments falling 24.2% year over year to $6.27 million units. The decline was mainly due to a tough year-over-year comparison as the company witnessed a strong increase in volume growth in the third quarter of 2022, driven by improved supply-chain issues due to lockdown ease in China.Story continuesDell Technologies’ DELL shipment fell 14.2% year over year to 10.32 million units, mainly due to weakness in enterprise PC demand, where it has a strong presence. Lenovo LNVGY shipped 16.15 million PCs during the quarter, down 4.4% from the year-earlier quarter.ASUS and Acer both registered a year-over-year decline in their PC shipments. While ASUS’ PC shipments fell 11.5% to 4.88 million units, Acer’s shipments dropped 2.4% to 4.39 million PCs.Per Gartner, Lenovo continues to hold the top spot on the vendor list, followed by HP and Dell with a market share of 25.1%, 21% and 16.1%, respectively. Apple, ASUS and Acer ended the July-September quarter with a market share of 9.7%, 7.6% and 6.8%, respectively.PC Market Recovery Expected SoonGartner pointed out that the worst could be over for vendors by the end of 2023, and PC market recovery can be seen in 2024 due to increased demand, driven by the PC refreshment cycle. Mikako stated, “The business PC market is ready for the next replacement cycle, driven by the Windows 11 upgrades. Consumer PC demand should also begin to recover as PCs purchased during the pandemic are entering the early stages of a refresh cycle.”Garter forecast that PC shipments would grow 4.9% in 2024, driven by increased shipments across both the business and consumer segments.Additionally, we believe that inventories coming near healthy levels and the growing interest in generative artificial intelligence-enabled PCs might give a fresh boost to PC demand in the years ahead.Of the leading vendors, Dell sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Morgan Stanley announced plans to convert two of its actively managed mutual funds into ETFs.The moves demonstrate the eagerness with which asset management firms that are relatively new entrants are embracing ETFs, which are cheaper and more liquid for investors than traditional mutual funds.Around 75% of the 376 new ETFs launched this year through Oct. 6 were active, according to Morningstar Direct. That means that rather than tracking an index, a manager or team is selecting assets aimed at reflecting an investment strategy or outperforming a specific benchmark.That compares with 63% last year and 36% in 2019 when U.S. securities regulators opened the doors to the product.Lower fees, strong liquidity and transparency have steadily lured investors away from traditional mutual funds and into ETFs over the past five years. U.S. ETF assets have doubled to reach $7.4 trillion. That accounts for nearly 30% of assets managed by all U.S. firms in mutual funds or ETFs, according to Morningstar.Mutual fund assets, meanwhile, fell 14% to $15.3 trillion.Traditional asset managers that built their reputations offering mutual funds are now trying to respond.""Some industry participants are playing catch-up,"" said Brendan McCarthy, head of ETF distribution at Goldman Sachs Asset Management which launched a small cap active ETF last week. It manages six other active ETFs, and 36 ETFs in total.While active ETFs only account for 6% of the market, their assets have grown at a rate of 23% so far this year, said Bryan Armour, an Morningstar analyst. That compares to asset growth of only 4.5% for the traditional passive index ETFs in the same period.Story continuesMany established asset management firms eager to capture a share of the rapidly-growing ETF market have identified their stockpicking skills as a competitive advantage.""This is very much the direction of travel for us,"" said McCarthy.Calamos Investment Management is another established manager trying to leverage its brand name and expertise investing in what are known as ""convertible bonds"", securities that pay out yields like bonds but that can be swapped for the underlying stocks. It rolled out an active ETF to draw on that expertise last week.“We think this is something distinctive, that draws on our analytical knowledge of the market,” said Matthew Kaufman, who joined Calamos in January to head its fledgling ETF business.Converting an existing mutual fund is another way traditional managers can catch up while also retaining star managers, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA, an investment research firm.""Conversions give a firm the opportunity to leapfrog up the leaderboard,"" Ullal added.Assets held in converted ETFs now tally some $78 billion, compared with $40 billion at the end of 2022, Ullal said.Morgan Stanley is among the latest managers to join the conversion rush. It plans to transform its Core Plus Fixed Income Portfolio fund and the Short Duration Municipal Income Portfolio fund, which have nearly $750 million in assets, into ETFs.

If you want to see some more of the world’s biggest asset managers, go directly to the 5 Biggest Publicly Traded Asset Managers.An asset manager handles combined funds for their clients, investing them accordingly. While hedge funds may be the most widely recognized type of asset management company, there exist various other categories of asset managers, including those overseeing mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds.In 2022, asset managers encountered a challenging period as assets under management (AuM) plummeted to $115.1 trillion, marking a nearly 10% decrease from the 2021 peak of $127.5 trillion. This decline was the most substantial in a decade. Looking ahead to the coming two years, inflation, market volatility, and shifts in interest rates are the primary concerns for both investors and asset managers. Nonetheless, PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, anticipates a recovery by 2027, projecting AuM to attain a base case of $147.3 trillion, showcasing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%.As we move further into the second half of the year, the stock market is beginning to reflect the expected impacts of the impending recession, aligning with predictions from J.P. Morgan Research. The firm anticipates a gradual economic decline in the United States by late 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, resulting in tighter credit conditions that will gradually dampen economic growth. While many stocks are on a downward trend, certain industries are flourishing despite this economic strain, presenting attractive investment opportunities for global investors. Some noteworthy sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, and DIY, along with related industries.The asset and wealth management sector is undergoing significant transformations due to a range of hurdles, including pressure on fees, escalating costs, and shifting investor preferences. These challenges are further heightened by market instability, increasing interest rates, inflation, and impending economic downturns. Nevertheless, the fundamental foundation of the industry remains robust, offering potential for appealing profitability. Moreover, there's a growing interest in alternative investments, thematic investment demands, and a preference for digital engagement. To capitalize on opportunities within the asset management domain, some top publicly traded options for investors include the likes of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).Story continuesBiggest Publicly Traded Asset ManagersPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this list of the 25 biggest publicly traded asset managers in the world, we used the rankings of The SWFI and ranked institutions by the total managed AUM.

42,0a4bf345-c6db-33bd-b0b8-cb21ff23f7a0,MS,2023-10-12,Earnings Preview: Morgan Stanley (MS) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-morgan-stanley-ms-140037584.html,1697032837,STORY,"['MS', 'IBKR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Morgan Stanley (MS) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.7%.Revenues are expected to be $13.25 billion, up 2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Morgan Stanley?For Morgan Stanley, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.89%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Morgan Stanley will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Morgan Stanley would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of +8.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Morgan Stanley doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.48 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +37%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.09 billion, up 38.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. has been revised 3.7% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

43,5ea2aafe-a2b4-3ee5-b6b7-28b3965b37e8,MS,2023-10-12,Weak Trading Performance to Hurt Morgan Stanley (MS) Q3 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weak-trading-performance-hurt-morgan-131000170.html,1697029800,STORY,['MS'],"[The performance of Morgan Stanley’s MS trading business (constituting a significant portion of its top line) is expected to have been subdued in the third quarter of 2023. The company’s quarterly numbers, slated to be announced on Oct 18 before the opening bell, are thus expected to have been hit by weak trading performance.While the risk of a near-term recession has faded, concerns like the economic slowdown, the central bank’s hawkish monetary policy and other geopolitical issues remain, which led to ambiguity among investors in the third quarter. Due to these factors, market volatility and client activity were subdued in the quarter.Moreover, since the third quarter is a seasonally weak one for capital markets, Morgan Stanley is expected to have witnessed a muted trading performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.35 billion, suggesting a fall of 4.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $1.84 billion indicates a year-over-year decrease of 15.5%.Our estimates for equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $2.34 billion and $1.67 billion, respectively.Other Key Factors at PlayInvestment Banking (IB) Income: Global deal-making witnessed a slight rebound in the third quarter, but M&amp;A activities remained subdued on a year-over-year basis. Headwinds like geopolitical tensions, government shutdown, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global economic slowdown continued to weigh on deal-making.Thus, the deal volume and total value numbers were weak in the third quarter. While Morgan Stanley’s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have provided some leverage, overall growth in advisory fees is not expected to have been that impressive in the quarter.The consensus estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $512 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 26.1%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $624.5 million, indicating a 9.9% dip.Then, the IPO market witnessed considerable activity in the third quarter, with 26 IPOs jointly raising $7.7 billion. The amount is almost equal to the total proceeds raised in 2022. However, the overall performance was still subdued and nowhere near normal.However, while follow-up equity issuances were soft in the to-be-reported quarter, bond issuance volumes improved from the prior-year quarter.Hence, Morgan Stanley’s underwriting fees are not expected to have declined much in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by a decent fixed-income underwriting performance.The consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $386 million, suggesting a rise of 5.5% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $263 million indicates an increase of 20.6%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $649 million implies a rise of 11.1% from the prior-year quarter.Our estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $376.2 million, while that for equity underwriting fees is $222.3 million.However, because of an expected decline in advisory revenues, growth in total IB income is likely to have been muted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.24 billion indicates a year-over-year decline of 2.8%. Our estimate for IB income is pegged at $1.22 billion.Net Interest Income (NII): The overall lending scenario was weak in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the Fed’s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial loans was weak in July and August, while real estate loans and consumer loans (specifically credit cards) witnessed decent demand.The Federal Reserve continued to tighten its monetary policy, increasing interest rates by another 25 basis points in the third quarter. The policy rate now stands at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. While this is likely to have had a favorable impact on Morgan Stanley’s NIM and NII, the inversion of the yield curve in the September-ended quarter, a slowdown in deposit growth and rising funding costs are expected to have weighed on it to an extent.The consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $2.06 billion, suggesting a decline of 18% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $1.98 billion, implying a decline of 21.3%.Management stated that it does not expect expansion in quarterly NII going forward.Expenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the September-ended quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have flared.Moreover, additional integration-related costs related to E*Trade and Eaton Vance are expected to have resulted in an increase in the overall cost base.We expect total non-interest expenses of $9.99 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 4.5%.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is -2.89%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings has moved 3.6% lower to $1.32 over the past seven days. The estimate suggests a 13.7% decline from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for earnings is $1.35 per share.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $13.3 billion, which indicates a year-over-year rise of 2%. Our estimate for total revenues is also pegged at $13.3 billion.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise Morgan Stanley price-eps-surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteStocks to ConsiderA couple of finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +2.11% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

Consider these safety measures while decorating this Halloween: Never put any decorations on or near utility equipment, like poles and transformers.Inspect each electrical cord of lights and decorations before use. Look for damage such as cracked, frayed or bare wires, damaged sockets or loose connections that can lead to shocks. If a cord is hot, don't use it.Use the proper clips for securing lights and decorations. Staples and nails can damage electrical cords.Decorative lights should be approved by Underwriter's Laboratory and carry a UL seal on the tag. Red UL marks indicate the lights are approved for indoor or outdoor use, while green UL tags indicate approval for indoor use only.Outdoor lights and decorations should be plugged into outlets that feature Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs).Indoor lights should not touch window treatments, carpet or furniture.Replace traditional candles with flame-free options like flashlights, battery-operated candles or glow sticks to light up your jack-o'-lanterns or seasonal decor.Keep flammable decorations, like cornstalks and bales of hay, far away from any open flames or heat sources, such as candles, heaters and light bulbs.Story continuesStay Safe While Trick-or-TreatingWhile collecting treats this season, the following tips can help keep your family and friends safe during popular events, including trunk-or-treat or trick-or-treat:Keep a clear, well-lit path at your home for trick-or-treaters. Prevent falls by keeping walkways, steps and porches free of electrical cords or any other items that may pose a hazard for trick-or-treaters.Carry a flashlight or add reflective tape, LED shoelaces or glow sticks to your costume to make yourself more visible to others in dark or dimly lit areas.Limit travel to well-lit, familiar areas. Always walk in groups and use sidewalks or crosswalks whenever possible.Motorists should use extra caution and keep an eye out for children crossing the street.

Data as of 10/10/23. We are on track to complete at least 350 miles of undergrounding by the end of the year, achieving permanent wildfire risk reduction. There are five phases to the work. We have completed 350 miles (or 100% of our 2023 target) of the most time and labor-intensive portions of this year’s underground projects – digging trenches and installing conduit. Timing of each phase can vary and is subject to change.Digging trenches and installing conduit, the piping that securely holds the electric lines in place when underground, is the most time- and labor-intensive portion of underground construction. As of today, undergrounding crews have completed 100% of that heavy construction work by digging 350 miles of trenches and laying 350 miles of conduit.After construction is complete, electric crews then pull powerlines through the conduit, install additional electrical-system equipment, de-energize the overhead powerlines and then energize the undergrounded lines.As of Oct. 10, more than 137 miles of the 350 miles have been fully energized. On average, about 20 more miles of undergrounded line will be energized each week through the end of the year. Customers in Middletown (Lake County), Clayton (Contra Costa County), Pollock Pines (El Dorado County) and Vacaville (Solano County) are among those already benefitting from getting their electricity from underground lines.""Our team has learned and accomplished so much in the past two and a half years since we announced our 10,000-mile Undergrounding Program,"" said Peter Kenny, PG&amp;E's senior vice president of Major Infrastructure Delivery, which includes undergrounding. ""That learning equates to greater efficiency and means we're able to safely put powerlines underground more  quickly and reduce the cost per mile.""PG&amp;E plans to put 2,000 miles of lines underground between now and 2026, with the annual mileage increasing from 350 in 2023 to 750 in 2026. Based on those miles, PG&amp;E anticipates the cost per mile of undergrounding will decrease from $3.3 million in 2023 to $2.8 million in 2026.Story continuesThe California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) will vote on undergrounding miles as early as Nov. 2 as part of the General Rate Case Final Decision. The CPUC counterproposals fund as few as 200 miles over four years, not enough to keep our customers and hometowns safe.In 2021, PG&amp;E announced that it would put 10,000 miles of powerlines underground to ensure permanent wildfire risk reduction in a way that mitigates the most risk and is most affordable in the long run.Expanding our electric system underground in High Fire Risk Areas (HFRAs) will not only help reduce wildfires caused by equipment, but also will improve reliability and reduce the need for Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) and Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings (EPSS). Wildfires affect all customers, regardless of whether they live near an actual fire zone. By undergrounding powerlines, all customers benefit from reducing all potential effects from ignitions.PG&amp;E has more than 2,000 highly skilled, fully dedicated coworkers working every day on underground projects across our service area.Kenny makes a strong case for the critical need for undergrounding.""Why are we putting lines underground? It provides permanent wildfire risk reduction for our customers and our hometowns and improves reliability,"" he said. ""And we've heard it loud and clear that customers want undergrounding.""Shasta County District 5 Supervisor Chris Kelstrom agrees. ""California has mismanaged our forests for three decades now. PG&amp;E is taking steps to reduce wildfire risk by undergrounding powerlines, and the CPUC is discouraging that plan. My county knows the devastating impact of wildfires.

Projects selected under the MIP can receive up to $15 million in award funding each for the design and development of a multi-customer, front-of-the-meter community microgrid.A community microgrid is a group of customers and distributed energy resources – such as a solar array and battery -- within clearly defined electrical boundaries with the ability to disconnect, operate independently from, and reconnect to the grid – a capability also known as ""islanding.""With their ability to operate independently from or in parallel with the grid, microgrids strengthen the resilience of communities by providing reliable power during outages or emergencies. Microgrids also enable efficient energy management and potential cost savings, while integrating of renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.A community microgrid's distributed energy resources can also participate in the statewide wholesale market for energy and related services – creating a potential source of earnings for the asset owner and providing an additional buffer for the California grid.Story continuesThe MIP stands beside PG&amp;E's Community Microgrid Enablement Program (CMEP), and together the two programs provide comprehensive financial and technical support for both the distributed energy resources and other costs necessary to develop and energize eligible microgrids, as well as the electric distribution system upgrades necessary to enable the safe islanding of the microgrid. Interested parties can apply for either one individually, or for both programs together.""PG&amp;E is paving the way for more community-proposed microgrids to be constructed in our service area through the Community Microgrid Enablement Program and Tariff, and the Microgrid Incentive Program will now also play a key role in advancing the development and facilitating the commercialization of clean-energy microgrids,"" said Jason Glickman, Executive Vice President of Engineering, Planning and Strategy, PG&amp;E. ""Several additional large-scale, community microgrids are expected to be deployed throughout PG&amp;E's Northern and Central California service area under the Microgrid Incentive Program over the next several years, and we look forward to continue engaging with customers and communities to bring these resilience solutions to our hometowns.""The Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid is the first fully renewable, multi-customer microgrid deployed in PG&amp;E's service area. It serves as the model for additional multi-customer microgrids to be deployed in California, and the Community Microgrid Enablement Tariff was also a product of its development.""Developing the Redwood Coast Airport Microgrid was an incredible team effort. We are proud that an unwavering focus on replicability resulted in policies and processes that are broadly applicable,"" says David Carter, technical lead for RCAM and Principal Engineer at the Schatz Energy Research Center. ""We commend PG&amp;E and the Redwood Coast Energy Authority for forging a new partnership model that empowers communities to play an active role in decarbonizing their electricity supply and increasing their local resilience.""Since 2021, PG&amp;E has engaged with more than three dozen communities to explore potential financial and infrastructure support options for developing microgrids through the CMEP. PG&amp;E provides technical and financial support on a prioritized basis for qualifying projects in areas with the greatest energy resilience needs.About the Microgrid Incentive Program Handbook and Upcoming WebinarsThe MIP Handbook includes information about all the incentives and allowances available, including details on eligibility, how to apply for funding and the process for development of a community microgrid.Target applicants include local and tribal governments and community-based organizations, which will partner with project developers and technical firms to design, develop, and operate the microgrids. Eligible project locations include rural, tribal, and low-income communities with greater energy resilience needs. Specific eligibility criteria are described in the handbook.For communities interested in exploring developing a multi-customer microgrid, PG&amp;E is hosting two upcoming webinars about the MIP:Informational Webinar: 12:00 -1:00 p.m. PT, Tuesday, October 17, 2023 - Register hereTechnical Webinar: 1:00 – 2:00 p.m. PT, Tuesday, October 24, 2023 - Register hereFor the first MIP application window, PG&amp;E requires interested parties to submit MIP project ideas by December 31, 2023, through an email to communitymicrogrids@pge.com.To learn more about PG&amp;E's community microgrid programs, or to access PG&amp;E's MIP handbook, visit www.pge.com/mipAbout PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

50,db90f6e0-435c-360d-8dda-08121e2e1fe9,ALGN,2023-10-12,"After Plunging -11.1% in 4 Weeks, Here's Why the Trend Might Reverse for Align Technology (ALGN)",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/plunging-11-1-4-weeks-133506324.html,1697031306,STORY,['ALGN'],"[A downtrend has been apparent in Align Technology (ALGN) lately with too much selling pressure. The stock has declined 11.1% over the past four weeks. However, given the fact that it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts are majorly in agreement about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier, the stock could be due for a turnaround.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why ALGN Could Bounce Back Before LongThe RSI reading of 26.22 for ALGN is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ALGN has increased 0.2%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ALGN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

51,dae26703-db52-387a-b034-3f4447bf2357,MRO,2023-10-12,7 Oil & Gas Stocks Ready to Gush This Fall,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-oil-gas-stocks-ready-011448241.html,1696554888,STORY,"['BAC', 'CVX', 'RIG', 'OXY', 'MRO', 'BORRO.OL', 'CPG']","[The year has been subdued for oil and gas stocks. It’s not surprising because oil traded below $70 per barrel in the first half of the year. Before talking about stock predictions for the sector, it’s important to mention that the outlook for 2024 is likely to be better. There are several oil &amp; gas stocks to buy at attractive levels that are poised for a strong entry into 2024.While crude has corrected in the last few trading sessions, the outlook remains bullish. Analysts at Bank of America believe that oil is likely to touch $100 per barrel before 2024. Chevron CEO has a similar opinion about oil before the beginning of the new year.If these expectations hold true, oil and gas stocks are likely to witness a strong rally in the coming months. After few quarters of consolidation, stocks in the sector are likely to enter 2024 with a big breakout. Coming back to the stock predictions, these are the oil and gas stocks to buy for a strong rally.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOil &amp; Gas Stocks to Buy: Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with ""diesel"" and ""food mart"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) stock has remained sideways for the last 12 months. I believe that the stock is ready to roar into 2024 after an extended period of consolidation. Valuations are attractive and CVX stock offers a robust dividend yield of 3.6%.There are two important reasons to like Chevron. First, the Company has an investment grade balance sheet with a net-debt ratio of 7% as of Q2 2023. High financial flexibility allows the Company to pursue aggressive organic and acquisition driven growth. In August, Chevron completed the acquisition of PDC Energy. The acquisition will add more than a billion barrels of oil equivalent to Chevron’s proved reserves.Further, Chevron’s assets have an attractive break-even. For Q2 2023, the Company reported operating cash flow of $6.3 billion. If oil averages around $100 per barrel, the Company will be positioned for annual OCF of $45 to $50 billion.Story continuesAker BP ASA (AKRBF)Image of an oil wells with a dark blue skySource: ShutterstockAker BP ASA (OTCMKTS:AKRBF) is a hidden gem in the oil and gas sector. AKRBF trades at a valuation gap and offers an attractive dividend yield of 9.9%. As oil trends higher, I believe that the stock is poised for a big rally.Aker BP is focused on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The Company has high quality assets like the Johan Sverdrup with a low oil price break-even. The Company’s portfolio has a break-even oil price of $35 to $40 per barrel. The cash flow potential is therefore significant if oil trades around $90 to $100 per barrel. Further, with 2P reserves of 1.86 billion barrels of oil equivalent, Aker BP is positioned to deliver sustained production growth.I must add that Aker has a quality balance sheet. As of Q2 2023, the Company reported a liquidity buffer of $6.1 billion. Further, with leverage at 0.22, there is ample flexibility to leverage for aggressive exploration activity and potential acquisitions. Historically, Aker BP has pursued the acquisition path to boost its asset base.Oil &amp; Gas Stocks to Buy: Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is Warren Buffett’s favorite oil and gas company. The legendary investor now holds more than 25% stake in Occidental. Over a 12-month period, OXY stock has traded marginally lower. A rally is likely with the stock looking attractive at current levels of $60.From a fundamental perspective, Occidental has an investment grade credit rating. For Q2 2023, the Company reported free cash flow of $1 billion. Healthy cash flows have allowed Occidental to deleverage and make aggressive capital investments.For the current year, Occidental plans to invest $5.4 to $6.2 billion. The major focus is on Permian assets that will continue to be cash flow drivers. At the same time, Occidental is investing in the lower carbon business. In August, the company acquired Carbon Engineering for a consideration of $1.1 billion. The Company has also initiated preliminary engineering study for a one million tonne-per-year Direct Air Capture facility in the United Arab Emirates.Transocean (RIG)An image of an offshore oil rigSource: Arild Lilleboe / Shutterstock.comTransocean (NYSE:RIG) trended higher by 71% for year-to-date. I remain positive on further upside and with 21% short interest, RIG stock might be poised for a short squeeze rally.As an overview, Transocean is among the leading players in the offshore drilling industry. As of July, the Company reported an order backlog of $9.2 billion. With few recent order intakes, the backlog has swelled to almost $10 billion. This provides Transocean with a clear revenue visibility.I must add that in the last few years, Transocean has worked on transforming its fleet to focus on ultra-deepwater and harsh environment rigs. The fleet age has also reduced significantly to 10 years. These two factors have translated into a better international rate of return and payback period as compared to peers.It’s also worth noting that as of Q2 2023, Transocean reported a strong liquidity buffer of $1.6 billion. With visibility for healthy cash flows, the Company can potentially pursue fleet expansion. At the same time, Transocean is looking to reduce debt by $3 billion in the next few years.Borr Drilling (BORR)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comBorr Drilling (NYSE:BORR) is another attractive offshore drilling contractor that seems poised for a sustained uptrend. The stock has trended higher by 38% for year-to-date. However, considering the potential growth in revenue and EBITDA, the stock remains attractively valued.Currently, Borr Drilling operates a fleet of 24 moderns jack-ups. The average age of the fleet is six years and the current backlog stands at $1.9 billion. A strong backlog coupled with a healthy order intake is likely to translate into sustained growth for Borr.To put things into perspective, the Company has guided for a base case revenue and EBITDA of $1.1 billion and $575 million respectively for the next year. Borr expects to accelerate revenue and EBITDA to $1.3 billion and $780 million respectively by 2026.Of course, this is a base case scenario and if oil sustains around $100 per barrel, the outlook is likely to change significantly. With a strong credit profile and a healthy backlog, BORR stock is a potential value creator.Marathon Oil (MRO)marathon oil (MRO stock) logo on a screenSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 9.5. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 2%. After an extended period of consolidation, valuations indicate that the stock is poised for a breakout rally.In terms of assets, Marathon is among the best. The Company has exposure to the Permian, Bakken, and Eagle Ford, in the United States. As of December 2022, the Company had 2P reserves of 1,338 million barrels of oil equivalent. A strong reserve base provides cash flow visibility even on stable production.From a fundamental perspective, Marathon oil has strong cash flows, which the company has used to create shareholder wealth. The company reported adjusted free cash flow of $532 million as of 2Q 2023. This implies an annualized FCF potential of $2 billion.It’s worth noting that Marathon paid $62 million as dividend and utilized $372 million in share repurchase in the 2Q 2023. I must add that a total liquidity buffer of $2.3 billion provides flexibility for aggressive exploration activity.Crescent Point Energy (CPG)a bunch of oil barrels are stacked highSource: ShutterstockCrescent Point Energy (NYSE:CPG) is among the relatively smaller players in the oil and gas industry that looks attractive. Besides trading at a valuation gap, CPG stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.76%.Last month, Crescent Point released the initial guidance for 2024 and there are several positives to note. First, the Company expects annual production in the range of 145,000 to 150,000 barrels of oil per day. With this production target, Crescent aims at generating excess cash flow of over $1 billion.Crescent Point has also provided an initial long-term outlook. It’s expected that production will increase to 180,000boepd by 2028. Even at $70 per barrel oil, the Company expects after-tax excess cash flow of over $4.3 billion on a cumulative basis through 2028.The important point to note is that 60% of the excess cash will be directed towards dividends and share repurchase. Therefore, there is ample room for shareholder value creation. Additionally, potential acquisition of assets can boost the growth outlook.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If she heads out to see any of her four grandchildren who also live in Maryland, she might wave to her neighbors—variously librarians and doctors—who also live in the building where she rents an apartment. Perdue may even walk past a chicken factory bearing her name because she is in fact an heiress worth billions—both through the Perdue chicken empire and the Sheraton hotel group.Over in Chicago, Elena Nuñez Cooper catches an Uber to work—she doesn't own a car—and spends six days a week working from the shared office space in her member's club, instead of renting costly commercial space.Down in Florida, tech entrepreneur Brenda Christensen spends her weekends exercising and enjoying the outdoors—avoiding coffee chains, the cinema and meals out as much as possible.Though not as rich as Purdue, both Nuñez Cooper and Christensen have fortunes that run into the multi-millions—but choose to reign in their finances and live a low-key life.Oracle of Omaha styleTheirs is a method that legendary investor Warren Buffett has long adopted: living in the same home he purchased in Omaha for $31,500 in 1958 and notoriously driving a 20-year-old car because he felt safe in it.""I do not think that standard of living equates with cost of living beyond a certain point,"" the man reportedly worth $116 billion famously said at a Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. ""There's a point, if anything, you start getting inverse correlation.""My life would not be happier…it'd be worse if I had six or eight houses or a whole bunch of different things I could have. It just doesn't correlate.""The data certainly backs up Buffett's philosophy. In March 2023 the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania sought to answer the question of whether money can truly buy happiness.Working with two datasets from previous studies, the researchers found that larger incomes do correlate with increasing happiness. However, only to a point: $100,000 to be exact.Story continuesSo what happens when you go above that threshold, and realize the full extent of what you can do with your wealth?The heiress who gives her wealth awayFor 82-year-old Perdue, a self-professed ""low maintenance badass,"" her wealth is an institution of which she is a steward as opposed to a keeper.Her parents taught Perdue early on that a person's identity was formed through their service, not their spending—a philosophy also followed by the family of her late husband, Frank Purdue.""We were married for 17 years until his passing,"" Perdue told Fortune in a video interview. ""During that time, I believe that I had the highest cobbler bill in Maryland, because rather than buy new shoes, we would simply get them repaired.""He had his name on the paycheck of 20,000 people but we would always fly economy.""Perdue grew up with a different idea of success, with a childhood where frugality and economy were celebrated.""I have a phrase that guides me,"" Perdue said. ""And it's that success is not measured by what you can get, but what you can give.""KYIV REGION, UKRAINE - DECEMBER 14, 2022 - American philanthropist and author Mitzi Perdue and head of the Main Department of the National Police in Kyiv Region Andrii Niebytov attend the handover of eight SUVs that will ensure security in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone to the regional police force at the Dytiatky checkpoint, Kyiv Region, northern Ukraine. (Photo credit should read Ruslan Kaniuka / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Like many billionaire families, the Perdues are keen but quiet philanthropists—among her aid to Ukraine has been the purchase of police vehicles and the donation of a $1.2 million ring, the proceeds of which enabled a women's shelter to open.Yet Perdue doesn't just want to send funds—she rolls up her sleeves and gets involved.Perdue has visited Ukraine three times—traveling the country through air raids, interviewing sources in bomb shelters, and meeting police bosses in war-torn Kyiv.Focussing particularly on the issues of human trafficking and land mines, Perdue says she's ""stared evil in the face,"" describing her work in Ukraine as ""possibly the best thing I've ever done in my life.""One of many initiatives was to purchase boats for the Ukrainian police, which were named after people who had lost their lives in the conflict. Perdue met with their families, she said, adding: ""I think to be remembered and recognized was enormously important. And that I could help a little bit—and I emphasize the word little—in keeping that person's memory alive and their sacrifice remembered.""What better use could you really have? I know it's not a lot. Even a little is just a tip of grief for somebody who's lost a child.""'I avoid Starbucks like the plague'Mom-of-one Christensen propelled herself to the status of self-made millionaire 10 times over, after moving from journalism to communications in the tech sector.Having sold her equity in one of the early firms she worked for, GoldMine Software—and enjoying a two-week retirement before boredom set in—Christensen took to flipping property in California.In 2015, Christensen, now the CEO of a public relations firm, moved her family out of Malibu to Florida—cutting her living expenses by 20% overnight—much to the shock of her peers at the time.What they didn't understand was the principle Christensen was raised with: her Danish father, a proponent of living simply and well, taught his children to recognize their privilege.""My father grew up in Puerto Rico,"" Christensen told Fortune. ""He made us very aware at an early age how privileged we were. He took us through the slums of Puerto Rico and said: 'I want you to know that not everybody lives in a suburban area in the United States. This is how most of the world lives.'""He was just instilling in me that it's not about stuff, it's about helping others and being of service.""Already teaching her 16-year-old daughter the same values she was raised with, Christensen added: ""I don't go to restaurants. I don't go to movies. I don't go to concerts. I cut my own hair.""I was pre-med at university so rarely go to the doctor because I understand how to take care of myself very well—diet, exercise all of that. I don't go to Starbucks, I avoid it like the plague. It just feels comfortable too because I've always been frugal.""Outgrowing the lavish lifestyleFor Nuñez Cooper, cutting back on her expenditure has meant she can donate sizable aid contributions to international crises whenever she wishes.The 32-year-old founder of Chicago-based Ascend PR, a firm that also acts as an advisor to family offices, said in her younger years she had enjoyed a ""lavish"" lifestyle.But Nuñez Cooper and her husband—who share a wealth of more than $4 million—knew if they lived not just within, but well under, their means they could ""give more and do more for people.""Among the costs cut was private jet use, which was axed for environmental reasons as well, while also bringing down a summer travel budget of six figures to a third of its former cost—predominantly by staying in rooms on offer at her members' club instead of paying for five-star hotels.""I don't know that I was any happier,"" Nuñez Cooper said in an interview with Fortune, adding when she made the decision to no longer have a car many peers asked if she was broke.""I like living a more simply but still living well. My quality of life has not decreased at all.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.com]"

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 2.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Starbucks Starbucks' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. The last dividend was quite comfortably covered by Starbucks' earnings, but it was a bit tighter on the cash flow front. By paying out so much of its cash flows, this could indicate that the company has limited opportunities for investment and growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 67.4% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 45%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendStarbucks Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.42 total annually to $2.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 18% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.Dividend Growth May Be Hard To AchieveThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Starbucks hasn't seen much change in its earnings per share over the last five years. Starbucks is struggling to find viable investments, so it is returning more to shareholders. This could mean the dividend doesn't have the growth potential we look for going into the future.Our Thoughts On Starbucks' DividendIn summary, while it's always good to see the dividend being raised, we don't think Starbucks' payments are rock solid. While Starbucks is earning enough to cover the dividend, we are generally unimpressed with its future prospects. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

74,0abc0136-075a-3eba-8b99-921cfa8d0638,SYY,2023-10-12,Shareholders in Sysco (NYSE:SYY) are in the red if they invested a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-sysco-nyse-syy-red-140024625.html,1697032824,STORY,['SYY'],"[Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) share price is down 13% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 22%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 1.2% in the last three years. It's down 13% in about a quarter.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Sysco To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate twelve months during which the Sysco share price fell, it actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 31%. Of course, the situation might betray previous over-optimism about growth.The divergence between the EPS and the share price is quite notable, during the year. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Sysco managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthSysco is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Sysco will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Sysco, it has a TSR of -10% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Sysco had a tough year, with a total loss of 10% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 22%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.8%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sysco better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Sysco  you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This move is part of a trend observed over the past year, where the insider has sold a total of 25,350 shares and purchased none.Sudhindra Kankanwadi is a key figure in Synopsys Inc, a company that provides software, hardware, and services for the design and verification of integrated circuits. The company's solutions help engineers address complexity and time-to-market challenges in the design of complex chips, mobile devices, automotive electronics, and other electronics.The insider's recent sell has raised eyebrows in the market, especially considering the insider trends for Synopsys Inc. Over the past year, there have been 14 insider sells and no insider buys. This could potentially indicate a lack of confidence in the company's future performance.Insider Sell: Sudhindra Kankanwadi Sells 12,355 Shares of Synopsys Inc (SNPS)On the day of the insider's recent sell, shares of Synopsys Inc were trading for $485.29 apiece, giving the company a market cap of $75.6 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 74.21, significantly higher than the industry median of 26.77 and the companys historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that the stock is currently overvalued.The GuruFocus Value of Synopsys Inc is $411.14, resulting in a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.18. This indicates that the stock is modestly overvalued. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.Insider Sell: Sudhindra Kankanwadi Sells 12,355 Shares of Synopsys Inc (SNPS)The insider's decision to sell a significant number of shares could be influenced by the current overvaluation of the stock. However, it's important to note that insider sells do not always indicate a negative outlook for the company. The insider may have personal financial reasons for selling the shares.Investors should keep a close eye on the insider trends and valuation metrics of Synopsys Inc. While the recent insider sell and the lack of insider buys over the past year could be concerning, the company's strong position in the integrated circuits design industry should not be overlooked.Story continuesAs always, it's crucial for investors to conduct their own thorough research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The stock outperformed the S&amp;P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.43%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.19%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.71%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of software used to test and develop chips had gained 7.87% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 1.56% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.1% in that time.Analysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Synopsys in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $3.04, signifying a 59.16% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.58 billion, up 23.3% from the year-ago period.For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $11.09 per share and a revenue of $5.83 billion, signifying shifts of +24.61% and +14.67%, respectively, from the last year.Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Synopsys. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. At present, Synopsys boasts a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Synopsys has a Forward P/E ratio of 44.2 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 28.We can additionally observe that SNPS currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.7. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Computer - Software industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.26.The Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 108, placing it within the top 43% of over 250 industries.The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

One of the growing strategies in the last few years has been in the realm of ESG investing, which focuses on companies that make their impact on the world a high priority. That shift in investment view has made data providers acknowledge the need for such analysis and made way for tracking the ESG scores of companies. According to McKinsey &amp; Company’s research, sustainability is one of the additional drivers for a company to perform even better.Companies like MSCI (NYSE:MSCI), London Stock Exchange Group, Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) and other data providers, offer their clients a quantitative view of a company’s goals in environmental, social and governance factors. They do this to better quantify the company’s impact and initiatives in the environment, society and its employees via proprietary analytics. That gives investors an objective look at the organization beyond its financial statement. If you want to align your investment strategy with personal beliefs like climate change awareness, social responsibility and more, then ESG investing may be for you. Here are three of the best ESG stocks investors should buy now.Owens Corning (OC)Image of the foundation and frame of a houseInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOwens Corning (NYSE:OC) is a building and industrial materials company that operates a Composites, Insulation, and Roofing segment. Its products include glass reinforcement materials, glass fiber products, low-mid-high temperature products for insulation, laminate, street asphalt and roofing. The company has built a reputation as one of the best choice for customers looking to replace their roofing.Owens Corning is one of the top choices for ESG investors, garnering high marks from various ESG analysis providers. OC recently announced the appointment of its new insulation segment president, Nicolas Del Monaco, with the previous president, Todd Fister, transitioning as chief financial officer. Besides being one of the top companies in terms of ESG, the company has delivered another strong quarter with better margins and earnings performance. OC is also focused on process innovation, new product development and existing product improvement to provide more growth. It had 17 new or refreshed products launched in the first half of 2023. With sustainability metrics and financial performance at the top of their game, Owns Corning is one of the best ESG stocks to buy.Story continuesBaker Hughes (BKR)The Baker Hughes (BKR) sign and office building in Houston, Texas.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comBaker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR) is an energy technology company operating in the Oilfield Services &amp; Equipment (OFSE) and Industrial &amp; Energy Technology (IEM) segments of the industry. BKR’s OFSE segment provides products and services designed for onshore and offshore oil and gas operations across a well’s entire lifecycle. Meanwhile, its IEM segment offers technology-based solutions ranging from compression, power generation and mechanical drive applications across the whole energy industry.Baker Hughes is another highly-rated stock in terms of sustainability. The company has an extensive sustainability strategy built upon social, environmental and corporate responsibility. Financials-wise, revenue is up by 25% year-over-year (YoY), and adjusted EBITDA also increased by 39% YoY. Second-quarter EPS also beat estimates by 21.87%. No wonder the company is a favorite of analysts, earning it a Strong Buy recommendation. Its solid ESG rating and excellent financial performance have put it on our best ESG stocks list.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)Woman standing in hotel room with luggage looking at the view. Hotel stocks.Source: Boyloso / ShutterstockHost Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and manages a portfolio of luxury and upper-upscale hotels. Its portfolio of brand names includes luxury hotels like Grand Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton, Hilton and Marriot. HST owns around 77 hotels and 41,900 rooms. The company is the largest lodging REIT and holds non-controlling interests in domestic and international ventures.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is another highly-rated company in terms of ESG, wherein responsible investment is a core focus of the company’s corporate responsibility program. HST aspires to be net positive by 2050 and has a 2030 roadmap for sustainability targets. Meanwhile, Q22023 margins took a hit as the company sought to stabilize its staffing levels and increase wages. Higher insurance and utility expenditures also contributed to the decline. HST expected this decrease, however, and it is also worth noting that the travel industry is still in recovery. Demand is expected to grow. The company is still in a solid position due to its excellent property locations and brand recognition. HST’s strong potential to take advantage of the market recovery and its commitment to sustainability goals make it one of the most recommended ESG stocks to buy.On the date of publication, Rick Orford did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

On a somber note, most airlines, including the likes of Delta Air Lines DAL and United Airlines UAL were forced to suspend direct flights to Tel Aviv following the attack by Hamas militants on Israel over the weekend.Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories1. In September, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits, i.e., 14.1% on a year-over-year basis at CPA. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In September, available seat miles (a measure of capacity) increased 13.6% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 87.3% from 86.9% in September 2022.CPA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.2. At GOL, the September readings for consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of traffic) and available seat kilometers (a measure of capacity) increased 6.7% and 4.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor for September 2023 improved to 83.3% from 81.7% in September 2022. The number of departures at GOL increased  11.2% year over year.3. For the month of September, Azul’s consolidated traffic increased 10.6% year over year. To match the increased demand situation, AZUL is expanding its capacity. In the same period, capacity grew 7.4% year over year. Since traffic growth was more than capacity expansion, the load factor increased 2.3 percentage points to 79.4% last month.Story continuesA traffic update for the month of September is also available in the previous week’s write-up.4. Southwest Airlines received encouraging tidings on the labor front when its material specialists, represented by International Brotherhood of Teamsters, approved a collective bargaining contract. The deal covers LUV’s more than 480 material specialists, who oversee technical operation inventory management across the airlines network. The deal becomes amendable in April 2026.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that most airline stocks traded in the red in the past week. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index declined 0.4% over the period to $52.67. Over the course of the past six months, the sector tracker declined 4%.What's Next in the Airline Space?Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are scheduled to report their third-quarter earnings numbers on Oct 12 and Oct 17, respectively. While passenger revenues are likely to have been impressive, high fuel costs are likely to have dented both DAL and UAL’s bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

82,0df1f261-ac7d-39cb-9647-1cc3039e6127,PM,2023-10-12,Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) Could Be Struggling To Allocate Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-nyse-pm-140013258.html,1697032813,STORY,['PM'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Philip Morris International:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.32 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 32%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 18% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Philip Morris International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Philip Morris International.What Can We Tell From Philip Morris International's ROCE Trend?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Philip Morris International, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 51% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Philip Morris International might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Philip Morris International is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 49% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Philip Morris International, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The engine factors several types of information into its assessment:Monitors data exclusive to DAT, including search and posting behaviors on DAT One.Continuously checks the completeness and accuracy of carrier profile information.Automatically flags suspicious activity.By integrating DAT's existing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Verosint’s (DAT’s ID verification vendor) in-depth identity verification data, we can now provide an unparalleled assessment of risk, ensuring even tighter access to the DAT marketplace.As cyber threats become more sophisticated, DAT remains committed to safeguarding its users through advanced technological measures. This innovative risk assessment engine is the next step in offering shippers, brokers, and carriers a secure, reliable environment to manage their freight.""Spot market transactions rely on speed and are often conducted without brokers and carriers ever meeting,"" said Satish Maripuri, DAT president and CEO. ""Trust and transparency are essential to a successful relationship, especially at a time when brokers and carriers need to be vigilant about the authenticity and performance of potential partners. With more than 350 million truck and load posts on the DAT One marketplace this year, DAT is uniquely positioned to equip customers with the information they need to confidently make the right choice.""Story continuesDAT’s risk assessment engine is integrated into the DAT One platform, allowing customers to review risk assessments without leaving the load board. It also can streamline a cumbersome carrier onboarding process, which can disrupt workflows and lead to misjudgments about risk and performance.DAT will apply its risk-assessment engine first to carrier performance, followed by a similar approach to evaluating brokers. It will be available starting in early 2024.""DAT has the advantages of vast amounts of data, a wide range of customers to collaborate with and a proven ability to deliver AI, machine learning and data science at scale,"" said Maripuri. ""Other onboarding and monitoring services rely predominantly on public sources. Our risk assessment engine combines that information with DAT’s depth of proprietary data. I am especially proud of the velocity of our DAT teams, who are bringing this innovative solution to market in record time.""The risk assessment engine is one of several initiatives introduced this year by DAT to promote transparency and reduce the risk of fraud in spot market transactions. These include:Predictive fraud detection, identity verification and multi-factor authentication to detect and stop suspicious logins and activity on the DAT network.An expanded Network Integrity Unit (NIU) dedicated to investigating reports of fraud.Anti-fraud education and training for customers.Collaboration with customers and industry partners, law enforcement agencies and regulators in the fight against fraud.For more information about DAT’s fight against fraud, visit www.dat.com/fraud-protection and www.dat.com/news-releases.About DAT Freight &amp; AnalyticsDAT Freight &amp; Analytics operates the largest truckload freight marketplace in North America.

The acquiree is a leader in asynchronous care, healthcare navigation services and triage. It is a suitable pick for Evernorth to enhance MDLIVE, its virtual care platform, with Bright.md’s technological and clinical capabilities.This move bodes well for Evernorth as it would improve health outcomes and the experience of patients by improving patient access to quality care, saving clinicians time and reducing the cost of providing care. An improvement in patient health outcomes and meaningful interactions between patients and providers would enhance Evernorth’s core value proposition by enhancing its offerings. Evernorth is also enhancing its MDLIVE platform by adding health coaching for patients suffering from chronic conditions. The company expects the Evernorth Health Services segment to report adjusted operating income on a pretax basis of a minimum of $6.4 billion in 2023.The company aims to provide care efficiently while reducing the cost of care. Hence, with this acquisition, it will be able to provide asynchronous care within MDLIVE through which patients can get access to care without the need for physical interaction. This service will be available for patients in 2024 and is expected to extend its benefits to support chronic disease management in the future.Such investments by the company highlight its unwavering focus on addressing health issues holistically and diversifying the avenues through which patients get access to care. A clinical digital interview will be taken and converted into a holistic chart and the clinician can go through the responses and provide diagnosis, prescriptions and care plans accordingly.Evernorth is also introducing health coaching as part of a patient care plan developed by a primary care physician. This move will support patients with chronic conditions and help providers manage lifestyle changes of patients, ultimately improving patient outcomes.Story continuesShares of Cigna have gained 11.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 1.9% growth.

For the full year, the company raised its adjusted EPS projection to the range of $7.28-$7.48. These projections consider various factors such as current global economic activity, soft global industrial production, continued economic uncertainty associated with geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries.The company expects performance coatings demand in Europe to stabilize at lower levels than the pre-conflict period in Ukraine while raw material and transportation normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels.For Industrial coatings, PPG anticipates a low single-digit percentage decline in organic sales due to lower global industrial production, except for modest growth in China.

88,14cb4c49-f50c-3b8e-9461-bfe2975398a4,PPG,2023-10-12,PPG Industries (PPG) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-ppg-reports-next-140033555.html,1697032833,STORY,['PPG'],"[The market expects PPG Industries (PPG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.94 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.9%.Revenues are expected to be $4.63 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.97% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries?For PPG Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.32%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that PPG Industries will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of $2.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.25, delivering a surprise of +5.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PPG Industries appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

90,0abd2e58-d93c-3181-a01b-379d49bb2c23,GS,2023-10-12,Goldman Sachs seen headed to steep earnings drop as deal-making lags,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-seen-headed-steep-101236805.html,1697105556,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[By Saeed AzharNEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs appears headed to another set of weak quarterly earnings as deal-making lags and the bank retreats from a loss-making consumer business. Goldman is expected to report third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $5.31 when it reports results on Tuesday, according to average estimates compiled by LSEG. That would reflect a 36% decline from its EPS of $8.25 a year earlier.Such lackluster results would follow second-quarter profits that sank to a three-year low. After a record 2021, Goldman's performance has been subdued since last year as rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and the war in Ukraine prompted companies to hold off on deal-making.""Goldman is more beholden to the capital markets"" than other banks, said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research Corp. Investment-banking doldrums are the biggest reason for weak earnings, he added.The company's third-quarter results will be depressed by writedowns of $300 million to $350 million on its commercial real estate assets, analysts wrote, after it set aside $485 million in the second quarter.Provisions for losses on credit cards will also drag profits lower, analysts said.Goldman Sachs declined to comment ahead of its earnings.On Wednesday, the bank said it agreed to sell GreenSky, a home improvement lender, and associated loans to a consortium led by investment firm Sixth Street Partners. The transaction is set to close in the first quarter.While it did not disclose the deal's value, Goldman will take a charge of 19 cents per share for the third quarter, adding to a previous writedown of $504 million in the second quarter.CEO David Solomon is scaling down the company's consumer business after it lost $3 billion over three years.The shift away from retail makes Goldman even more reliant on businesses that swing with economic cycles, Biggar said.The firm's global banking and markets unit, which houses investment banking and trading, accounted for about 66% of its revenue in the second quarter.Story continuesUBS on Wednesday cut its target price for Goldman Sachs to $382 a share from a previous target of $400. UBS still has a buy rating on the stock.Goldman shares slipped 0.6% on Wednesday to close at about $313 a share. They have fallen almost 9% this year.While the stock ""is one of the best plays on a recovery"" in investment banking, threats are mounting to such a bounce-back, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken wrote in a note.The firm has taken a leading role in several initial public offerings this year, including for chip designer Arm Holdings, but its business advising on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) has remained weak in line with the broader industry, Biggar said.""It's still very uncertain,"" Solomon told Reuters in an interview last month. ""People are starting to open up to a better environment and think a little bit more forward strategically, but there's a lag time,"" he said, referring to M&amp;A.Sluggish markets prompted the firm to lay off thousands of employees in January in its biggest round of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis.It may cut about 400 more employees in the coming weeks as part of its annual performance review, targeting under-performers, two sources familiar with the matter said last month. The bank declined to comment at the time.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Rod Nickel)]"

He said it’s too early for arbitration since talks are still underway to resolve the conflict and accused the U.S. bank of trying to shift attention away from its payment obligations.Under a 2020 deal, Goldman Sachs paid Malaysia $2.5 billion to resolve criminal charges over the 1MDB saga. It also guaranteed it would help recover $1.4 billion in 1MDB assets. including $500 million by August 2022. If it failed, it had to cough up $250 million as an interim payment. The two sides are at odds over the interim payment.Malaysia says Goldman Sachs failed to recover the agreed amount last year and must pay the $250 million. The bank disagreed.Johari said the government has extended the deadline for talks four times. Malaysia could commence arbitration proceedings if a settlement is not reached by Nov. 8, he said.“At this juncture ... the parties are still considered to be in the amicable good faith discussions stage and therefore as an aggrieved party, the 1MDB task force views Goldman Sachs’ initiation of arbitration proceedings as premature,” he said in a statement.Separately, the Attorney-General's Chambers said it received an application for arbitration from Goldman Sachs on Wednesday after the bank accused Malaysia of breaches. It denied all the allegations made by the bank, saying they ""mischaracterizes the conduct of the government.""It said in a brief statement that the government will respond according to the law and stressed that the public interest was paramount.Investigators say more than $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, a fund set up by then Malaysian leader Najib Razak to fund economic development projects. The funds were laundered and used to buy yachts and real estate and to finance the 2013 film ""The Wolf of Wall Street.”Story continuesThe saga led to the Najib's defeat in 2018 general elections. He began a 12-year jail term last year after losing an appeal against his conviction for the first of several graft charges linked to 1MDB. Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, accused of being the architect of the plot, is an international fugitive.Goldman Sachs arranged $6.5 billion in bonds for the fund in 2012 and 2013, earning more than $600 million in fees. Roger Ng Chong Hwa, one of two former Goldman bankers charged in the U.S., was sentenced in March to 10 years in jail. His prison term was put on hold as Ng was repatriated to Kuala Lumpur over the weekend to help with 1MDB asset recovery efforts, officials said.Tim Leissner, Ng’s former boss at Goldman Sachs, pleaded guilty in 2018 to bribing government officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. He was ordered to pay $43.7 million and became a key government witness during Ng’s two-month trial. He hasn't been sentenced.]"

Caroline Ellison testified against Sam Bankman-Fried, Oprah enters the Ozempic era, and Fortune senior writer Alicia Adamczyk writes about the cultural impact of the Barbie movie, as discussed on Day 2 of Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. Enjoy your Wednesday. - The power of pink. I wasn’t expecting to cry while watching the Barbie movie, but then again, I also wasn’t expecting to watch an at-times hysterical and at others profoundly moving meditation on what it means to be human when I sat down in the theater a few months ago.The ticket sales speak for themself: Worldwide, the movie's box office haul is approaching $1.5 billion, making it one of the biggest films of the year and the highest-grossing global release in Warner Bros. history. Clearly I wasn’t the only one moved by the film.Yesterday, during a conversation with Fortune’s Michal Lev-Ram at the Most Powerful Women Summit, Robbie Brenner, president of Mattel Films, and Lisa McKnight, executive vice president and chief brand officer of Mattel, Inc., highlighted what made the film so resonate. “It’s a story about humanity,” McKnight said. “We elevated Barbie beyond a doll to an idea.”It helps that Barbie is an iconic toy with decades of cultural cache, of course, and that Warner Bros. poured an estimated $150 million into the marketing. But as McKnight and Brenner noted, it mostly worked due to the creative team—namely, writer/director Greta Gerwig and actress/producer Margot Robbie—who helped bring it to life and make it a unique story and moviegoing experience.Of the many fascinating aspects of the Barbie movie—The outfits! The set design! The practical effects!—one I’ve been stuck on is how much fun Gerwig was able to have, poking fun not just at mansplain-ations of The Godfather and bad dates, but at Mattel itself. Though McKnight noted the company had a heavy hand in approving what ended up on screen, the movie didn’t feel like one long ad for the toy. Provocative, inspiring, and authentic were some of the words Brenner used to describe the film.Story continues“It’s not about selling toys, it’s about telling the best stories,” Brenner said. “If you’re not making something that feels out of the box and different and sticky, then you have no business making content.”Since Barbie’s resounding success, there’s been plenty of chatter about which toy movie studios might try to turn into their next billion-dollar hit, and films based on Polly Pocket, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and Hot Wheels are already in the works.Brenner has some advice for Lena Dunham, Vin Diesel, and JJ Abrams, who are attached to those films—as well as anyone else looking to create the next cultural touch point. “When you take those big swings, that’s when life rewards you,” she said.Alicia Adamczykalicia.adamczyk@fortune.com@AliciaAdamczykThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

Craig Irwin, ROTH Capital Partners Senior Research Analyst, and Ronald Jewsikow, Guggenheim Securities Vice President – Automotive Equity Research, join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss their top EV stocks to watch as part of the weekly series ""EVs: The Road Ahead.""One company to keep an eye on is EVgo (EVGO, EVGOW). According to Irwin, EVgo is ""seeing actually charging rates on their networks become 10 percent of miles driven versus what they were at about 5 percent just a couple years ago."" Irwin added, ""I think the investment in infrastructure is the right thing to do because it drives jobs in America.""Among the EV tier 1 suppliers, Jewsikow sees Aptiv (APTV) as one to watch. Jewsikow explained, ""They make electrical architecture, so you think of connectors and wiring, kind of the guts of the vehicle."" He added, ""They have business with almost every electric vehicle manufacturer in the world, that includes Tesla among others.""Watch all of Yahoo Finance's special coverage ""EVs: The Road Ahead.""Video TranscriptCRIAG IRWIN: The EV industry is going to change the future versus what combustion engines have been doing. So infrastructure is a very, very important part of adoption. Frankly, to build the EV charging infrastructure out there, we probably need another $10 to $20 billion on top of the $7 and 1/2 that's been set aside.One of the stocks we're recommending investors look at closely is EVgo. We're bullish on EVgo right here. Why? Because even though inventories are climbing on the lots of the mainline auto dealers-- many of them are seeing their inventories at 90 days or plus. EVgo is not seeing it. They're seeing actual charging rates on their networks become 10% of miles driven versus what they were at about 5% just a couple years ago. And you compare that to Tesla drivers, you know, 15% out there. So there's a discrete mix towards people charging not in their home, not at their workplace, but to using EV chargers to go longer distances, drive their EVs more.Story continuesI think the investment in infrastructure is the right thing to do because it drives jobs in America, and, you know, it's not really that heavy compared to some of these other things that have happened out there.RONALD JEWSIKOW: In the tier-one suppliers, I think Aptiv is the best way to play electrification. It's global scale. They make electrical architecture, so you think of connectors and wiring, kind of the guts of the vehicle, as well as they have a pretty large ADAS and infotainment segment.But specific to electrification, their content on an electric vehicle is more than twice as high as their content on an ICE vehicle. They have business with almost every major electric-vehicle manufacturer in the world. That includes Tesla, among others.So you think about electric vehicle adoption where it's stronger right now in Europe and China. Aptiv is a way to play that. It's a global name, global footprint. They actually make-- they generate more revenue and more growth from electric-vehicle adoption in Europe and China today.]"

TRI, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL, Trane Technologies plc TT and Aptiv PLC APTV.Industry: Technology ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2163263/4-stocks-from-the-prospering-technology-services-marketThe technology services sector has witnessed robust growth since the pandemic, fueled by the rapid adoption of remote work, accelerating the global digital transition. Technological advancements like 5G, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) have further driven industry expansion. Additionally, increased concerns about data security have acted as a catalyst for industry growth.Thomson Reuters Corp., Marvell Technology, Inc., Trane Technologies plc and Aptiv PLC are poised to gain from the prevailing trends of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Technology Services industry encompasses companies involved in producing, developing and designing various software support, data processing, computing hardware and communications equipment. These offerings range from integrated powertrain technologies, advanced analytics, technology solutions, and contract research services to semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies, collaboration software, specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems.This industry caters to consumer and business markets and serves diverse end markets and customer segments. Additionally, some industry players offer advanced analytics, clinical research services, data storage technology and solutions and technology-enabled financial services for consumers and small business owners.Factors Structuring the Future of Technology ServicesRising Demand Environment: The industry has been gaining traction over the past year, thanks to recent technological advancements and the onset of remote work. Revenues, income and cash flows have been growing in the past year, aiding many industry players to pay out stable dividends.Story continuesCloud Computing Gains Traction: Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market was valued at USD 483.98 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1% from 2023 to 2030. Factors driving this growth include the cloud's ability to enhance business performance, increasing demand for hybrid and Omni-cloud systems and pay-as-you-go models.Government efforts to safeguard data and the adoption of hybrid work models post the COVID-19 pandemic are also contributing. However, data security concerns constrain growth, while large enterprises embrace the cloud to reduce costs and manage data efficiently, especially with pay-as-you-go models. Large businesses are rapidly adopting cloud services due to their on-demand availability.Technological Advancement Take Centre Stage: The global shift towards digitization creates opportunities in various markets, including 5G, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI). The United States, a significant player in the IT sector, is positioned for growth due to the widespread adoption of smart technologies and increased investments in security. Companies increasingly adopt AI, ML, blockchain, and data science to gain a competitive advantage.According to Statista, the worldwide artificial intelligence market was worth $142.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $207.9 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to reach a staggering $1.85 trillion by 2030. This indicates a substantial Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 41.75% from 2022 to 2030. MLis is anticipated to experience significant growth, increasing from $140 billion to $2 trillion by 2030.Cybersecurity, talk of the town: The rapid adoption of technology services has brought about some negative consequences. The FBI, for instance, has reported a 300% surge in cybersecurity cases. Nevertheless, the industry benefits from the growing demand for data security and privacy protection solutions. The increasing frequency of cyberattacks and associated security threats is anticipated to sustain the industry's growth.Per Statista, Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2028) of 10.48%, resulting in a market volume of $273.60 billion by 2028. According to Statista, the IT Services market is projected to reach $1,204 billion in 2023, with the market volume expected to reach $1,570 billion. This suggests a compound annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2027) of 6.86%.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Technology Services industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92.

If you want to see some more of the world’s biggest asset managers, go directly to the 5 Biggest Publicly Traded Asset Managers.An asset manager handles combined funds for their clients, investing them accordingly. While hedge funds may be the most widely recognized type of asset management company, there exist various other categories of asset managers, including those overseeing mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds.In 2022, asset managers encountered a challenging period as assets under management (AuM) plummeted to $115.1 trillion, marking a nearly 10% decrease from the 2021 peak of $127.5 trillion. This decline was the most substantial in a decade. Looking ahead to the coming two years, inflation, market volatility, and shifts in interest rates are the primary concerns for both investors and asset managers. Nonetheless, PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, anticipates a recovery by 2027, projecting AuM to attain a base case of $147.3 trillion, showcasing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%.As we move further into the second half of the year, the stock market is beginning to reflect the expected impacts of the impending recession, aligning with predictions from J.P. Morgan Research. The firm anticipates a gradual economic decline in the United States by late 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, resulting in tighter credit conditions that will gradually dampen economic growth. While many stocks are on a downward trend, certain industries are flourishing despite this economic strain, presenting attractive investment opportunities for global investors. Some noteworthy sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, and DIY, along with related industries.The asset and wealth management sector is undergoing significant transformations due to a range of hurdles, including pressure on fees, escalating costs, and shifting investor preferences. These challenges are further heightened by market instability, increasing interest rates, inflation, and impending economic downturns. Nevertheless, the fundamental foundation of the industry remains robust, offering potential for appealing profitability. Moreover, there's a growing interest in alternative investments, thematic investment demands, and a preference for digital engagement. To capitalize on opportunities within the asset management domain, some top publicly traded options for investors include the likes of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).Story continuesBiggest Publicly Traded Asset ManagersPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this list of the 25 biggest publicly traded asset managers in the world, we used the rankings of The SWFI and ranked institutions by the total managed AUM.

103,ecb10174-4f4c-3756-bd81-b372d50b258b,NTRS,2023-10-12,Earnings Preview: Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-northern-trust-corporation-140037562.html,1697032837,STORY,['NTRS'],"[The market expects Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.72 billion, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.17% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Northern Trust Corporation?For Northern Trust Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Northern Trust Corporation would post earnings of $1.63 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.79, delivering a surprise of +9.82%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Northern Trust Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -5.8%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $4.3 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has been revised 3.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.04%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The union resumed negotiations with studios last week after the Writers Guild of America (WGA) ended its work stoppage.The WGA deal had raised hopes for a quick resolution with actors until the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), late on Wednesday, said talks were suspended once it reviewed the most recent union proposal.""After meaningful conversations, it is clear that the gap between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA is too great, and conversations are no longer moving us in a productive direction,"" said the AMPTP, which represents Netflix, Walt Disney and other media companies.SAG-AFTRA, in a letter to members issued early Thursday, said it had negotiated ""in good faith"" with studios ""despite the fact that last week they presented an offer that was, shockingly, worth less than they proposed before the strike began.""""It is with profound disappointment that we report the industry CEOs have walked away from the bargaining table after refusing to counter our latest offer,"" union negotiators said.One issue of contention is a SAG-AFTRA demand for a share of streaming revenue delivered as a bonus to cast members. The AMPTP said the proposal ""would cost more than $800 million per year, which would create an untenable economic burden.""SAG-AFTRA countered that the AMPTP had overstated the cost by 60% and accused the studios of ""bully tactics.""Story continuesThe union also said studios ""refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI,"" while the AMPTP said it had promised to obtain actors' consent before using any digital replicas of their likenesses.On issues such as general wage increases and residuals for high-budget streaming shows, the AMPTP said it had offered the same terms that were ratified by the WGA and the Directors Guild of America, but that SAG-AFTRA rejected them.Members of the WGA approved a new three-year contract with major studios this week, five months after the union called a strike. The new contract provides pay raises, some protections around AI use and other gains.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Gursimran Kaur in Bengaluru; Editing by Kim Coghill, Robert Birsel)]"

The stock's performance was behind the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.43%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.19%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.71%.Shares of the internet video service witnessed a loss of 14.12% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Consumer Discretionary sector with its loss of 2.8% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.1%.Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Netflix in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on October 18, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Netflix to post earnings of $3.47 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 11.94%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $8.53 billion, showing a 7.65% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.For the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $11.91 per share and a revenue of $33.68 billion, representing changes of +19.7% and +6.54%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.08% fall in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Netflix presently features a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Story continuesIn terms of valuation, Netflix is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 31.35. This indicates a premium in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 12.71.One should further note that NFLX currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.39. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Broadcast Radio and Television was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.39 at yesterday's closing price.The Broadcast Radio and Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 206, which puts it in the bottom 19% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis internet video service is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.9%.Revenues are expected to be $8.53 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Netflix?For Netflix, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.71%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Netflix will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Netflix would post earnings of $2.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.29, delivering a surprise of +16.25%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Netflix doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In addition, the company remains on track in converting its San Francisco refinery into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities, with commercial operations set to begin in early 2024. The firm has also made progress on various projects designed to enhance efficiency, increase utilization and bolster capture rates, which can deliver $800 million in cost savings by the end of 2023.

Given the market’s concern that current refining margins are unsustainable, Phillips 66 trades for just 7x this year’s EPS. However, unlike other refiners, the majority of Phillips 66’s intrinsic value comes from its non-refining business segments, providing a more stable base of cash flow. Even if refining margins eventually return to historical average levels, we believe we are paying a single-digit multiple of normalized earnings for a collection of advantaged midstream and downstream assets.

Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category.

Within the past year, PSX's PEG has been as high as 0.66 and as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.40.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PSX's P/B ratio of 1.59.

These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.Our research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance.

But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX) share price is up 58% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. It's fair to say the stock has continued its long term trend in the last year, over which it has risen 38%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, TJX Companies achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 8.0% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 10% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how TJX Companies has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. If you are thinking of buying or selling TJX Companies stock, you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for TJX Companies the TSR over the last 5 years was 69%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that TJX Companies has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 40% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 11% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corp. TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST.Industry: Retail - Discount StoresLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2163365/4-stocks-from-the-buoyant-retail-discount-store-spaceThe outlook for the Retail – Discount Stores industry remains optimistic, driven by a combination of consumer trends, technological innovations and strategic adaptations. With consumers becoming increasingly value-conscious, discount retailers are well-positioned to cater to this demand. The industry's resilience, especially during economic uncertainties, is bolstered by the sector's ability to offer cost-effective products.Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows retailers to optimize their operations, personalize customer experiences and enhance overall efficiency, ensuring a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corp. and Ross Stores, Inc. have been deepening engagements with consumers and adding more compelling products.About the IndustryThe Retail - Discount Stores industry is a significant segment within the retail sector that caters to price-conscious consumers seeking value-for-money products. These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing, and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing.These stores often carry both national and private-label brands, providing a mix of products to cater to a diverse customer base. The Retail - Discount Stores industry has shown resilience even during economic downturns, as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.Story continues4 Key Industry Trends to WatchConsumers' Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers' purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. August marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending.With the holiday season approaching, retailers are all gearing up to walk the extra mile to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

EV infrastructure company ChargePoint's (CHPT) stock tumbles while raising $232 million in its path to profitability. Lastly, Leerink Partners upgrade Amgen (AMGN) to ""Outperform.""Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton monitor several of the day's top trending stocks in the after-hours trading session.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- Plug Power, those shares are popping, after the company projected a sharp rise in revenue by 2027. Company expecting revenue to rise to roughly $6 billion. I find this story pretty fascinating because, typically, Josh, the market is very short-term focused. Plug Power's short-term forecast was not great.It actually is at the lower end. But the market seems to be looking longer term, which is a bit unusual.- Yeah, so closer to the here and now, they expect 1.2 billion in 2023. You're right, the Street was closer to 1.28 billion. And then looking farther out, they give these estimates, $6 billion in revenue in 2027, $20 billion by 2030.We should note, listen, nice pop here, today, but this stock, Julie, has been shelled. I mean, it's down about 40% so far this year.- Yeah, as you can see, they're a pretty volatile company, as well. It's a green hydrogen company, by the way, for those who are not familiar with Plug Power.- And ChargePoint, that is, that one's taking a different course. This one is sliding in today's trading session. The move to the downside coming after the company said it's raising $232 million via stock sales. ChargePoint noting the move aims to support its path to profitability in 2024. So read through the reports here, Julie.What analysts are noting is that its amendment to the $300 million in convertible notes, issued in April 2022, that is overshadowing that 232 million equity raised this quarter. So RBC, for example, saying the equity raise is going to provide additional comfort that the company has the cash liquidity to reach this cash flow break-even target by the end of next year.Story continuesBut their point to their clients is the amendment in convertible notes is actually an offset. And that stock, by the way, down about 60% so far in 2023.- Right. It's pretty interesting, here. So, basically, what they're doing is on those convertible notes, they're giving themselves more time but they're paying higher interest, which seems to indicate relatively no demand, low demand, right. So now the modification, the amendment those convertible notes, is that the notes were due in 2027 and we're paying 3 and 1/2 to 5%, over 5%.Now the spread is 7 to 8 and one half percent due in 2028. So, basically, it's getting more expensive for this company to borrow that money, effectively, is what's going on, amidst tightening financial conditions.- And investors are not happy.- No, definitely not. And then, finally, we're looking at Amgen, as well. That stock got upgraded to an outperform at Leerink Partners, the firm citing earnings upside, as well as several catalysts in the near term. And then the shares took another leg up. Right now they're up 4 and 1/2 percent.Apparently, the company was awaiting some data from a cancer trial and then pushed that, the release of that, back to Friday. It was supposed to be out at noon today. Michael Yee, over at Jefferies, a biotech analyst who's closely watched, says that this could be a positive sign, that he's pushed it back.- Yes, he thinks- this is reading the tea leaves. He thinks maybe this embargo is part of this broader press move, Julie, and that the data should be decent, right, to his clients. We are optimistic there will be multiple responses, including in lung, which could ultimately be a blockbuster market. So we'll see if he's read the clues correctly.- We'll see. He is always outspoken.]"

However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition; and often contain words such as ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""pending,"" ""proposed"" or ""potential."" Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements relating to (i) the pending transaction to acquire the share capital of Newcrest Mining Limited, timing and implementation of the pending transaction, including receipt of required approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions; (ii) estimates of expected synergies; (iii) estimates of expected incremental cash flow generation and portfolio optimization opportunities; and (iv) other expectations regarding the combined business.Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect.

In addition, material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements include: the inherent uncertainty associated with financial or other projections; the prompt and effective integration of Newmont Corporation’s (Newmont) and Newcrest’s businesses and the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the pending transaction; the risk associated with Newcrest’s ability to obtain the approval of the pending transaction by their shareholders required to implement the pending transaction and the timing of the implementation of the pending transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the pending transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all and the failure of the pending transaction to be implemented for any other reason; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the parties and others related to a scheme implementation deed dated May 15, 2023, as amended by a letter dated September 4, 2023; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the pending transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of the scheme consideration to be issued in connection with the pending transaction; the anticipated size of the markets and continued demand for Newmont’s and Newcrest’s resources and the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on pending transaction-related issues.

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. But Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE:PEG) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 13% over five years, which is below the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 11%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for Public Service Enterprise Group While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, Public Service Enterprise Group moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Public Service Enterprise Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Public Service Enterprise Group will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Public Service Enterprise Group the TSR over the last 5 years was 34%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectivePublic Service Enterprise Group provided a TSR of 15% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 6% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

With this extension of the second phase of PSE&amp;G's Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP), the state's largest utility expects to invest $902 million over two years, maintaining hundreds of well-paying jobs and contributing to New Jersey's economy.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) is a publicly traded diversified energy company. Its operating subsidiaries are: PSEG Power, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&amp;G) and PSEG Long Island. (PRNewsfoto/PSEG)The extension allows PSE&amp;G to continue to update its existing gas distribution system to improve reliability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 54,000 metric tons CO2e, by replacing at least 400 miles of aged pipes with modern ones. Although nearly 1,800 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains have been replaced in recent years, PSE&amp;G remains the nation's utility with the largest number of aging cast iron pipes, much of which is 70 to 100 years old.""Continuing this work that reduces methane emissions and enhances the reliability of our gas system is a critical step to realizing our Powering Progress vision for customers,"" said Kim Hanemann, president and chief operating officer, PSE&amp;G. ""Natural gas has been the most affordable heating option for millions of New Jersey customers for years. We're pleased to continue our balanced approach to decarbonization while meeting today's energy demand.""The benefits of GSMP include:Prioritizing and replacing pipelines most prone to leaks, including many in municipalities that have a significant number of overburdened communities;Maintaining the infrastructure through upgraded equipment, such as modern regulators and the installation of excess flow valves, with the aim of enhancing safety;Upgrading to higher pressure during replacement enabling customer use of higher efficiency and more environmentally-friendly appliances;Immediate reduction of leaks by installation of new pipes that can also deliver emerging lower-carbon alternative fuels;Ensuring our customers' power sources remain affordable and diversified; andRealizing the benefits of maintaining jobs and vendor relationships through the continuity of the program.Story continuesIn 2014, PSE&amp;G began to accelerate the updating of its gas system by replacing aged pipes with state-of-the-art gas lines. We are about a third done, having replaced 1,450 miles of gas lines. We have also reduced methane emissions by approximately 300,000 metric tons CO2e from 2011 to 2022 – the equivalent of taking 65,000 cars off the road. The second phase of GSMP was completed earlier this year and reduced PSE&amp;G's gas system methane emissions by approximately 22% from 2018 levels.The updated lines are also more reliable. When Tropical Storm Ida caused widespread flooding in September 2021, 90,000 gas customers were spared shutoffs due to our modernizing efforts.PSE&amp;G residential gas bills are now approximately 35 percent lower than in 2008, including February 1, March 1 and October 1 gas supply price reductions reflecting lower natural gas supply costs. The extension is forecasted to increase monthly average gas bills for the typical residential gas customer about 3.8% percent or $3.50 per month.As part of this settlement, PSE&amp;G also agreed to defer action on its third phase of GSMP, with the parties to that filing to reconvene on it by no later than January 31, 2025. Work covered under the third phase, if approved, would be expected to commence in January 2026.PSE&amp;GPublic Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. is New Jersey's oldest and largest gas and electric delivery public utility, as well as one of the nation's largest utilities. PSE&amp;G is the 2022 Edison Award recipient from the Edison Electric Institute.

Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics General Dynamics Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairperson &amp; CEO, Phebe Novakovic, sold US$7.6m worth of shares at a price of US$228 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$238). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 3.9% of Phebe Novakovic's holding.All up, insiders sold more shares in General Dynamics than they bought, over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At General Dynamics Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at General Dynamics. Specifically, insiders ditched US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that General Dynamics insiders own 0.6% of the company, worth about US$403m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About General Dynamics Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying.

This comes after UAW workers at Volvo's Mack Trucks rejected a tentative deal.Also, Samsung SDI (006400.KS) and Stellantis are planning to build an EV battery plant facility in Indiana.Yahoo Finance Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian breaks down the latest news in the auto industry. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript- The UAW strike against the big three automakers may be spreading. A new strike is on the horizon, this one at defense contractor General Dynamics. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramnian is here with the details. Pras?Hey Josh. As this big three UAW strike enters the 27th day, we saw earlier this week that the UAW members at Mack Trucks rejected a tentative deal and went on strike on Monday. Now just a couple of days later, we hear about last night General Dynamics the defense contractor saying that its members voted to authorize the strike by a 97% vote to potentially go on strike if their deal with the General Dynamics does expires on the 22nd of October.So they've authorized that strike. You know I wonder if the moves by the UAW members of big 3 has sort of emboldened these workers. We'll see but potentially another UAW chapter here going on strike with the defense contractor. But also, I want to note that GM's kind of a reprieve for GM at least them in Canada.Unifor members there, the Canadian Auto Workers Union, they actually struck a deal their tentative deal with GM to increase base pay, increase Cola adjustments and things like that. So reprieve there for GM as the sort of big three strikes happen in the US.- You know, Pras, while all this is going on strike-wise, we got another interesting announcement. Samsung SDI and Stellantis are creating a new, planning a new EV battery plant in Indiana while all this is happening. So tell us about that and what we make of it.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMNIAN: Yeah it is just a lot going on right now in the world of the UAW, and the big 3, and all these other plants that are associated with the UAW. But yes, a couple of days ago, Julie, it was Sean Fein sort of pulled back on any possible strikes on Friday saying that they had reached an agreement with GM potentially where GM would said they will include the joint venture battery plants with their master agreement, meaning that UAW members could unionize at these plants.That's sort of a big deal because it was a sticking point, and maybe Ford and GM have to, sorry, Ford and Stellantis may have to follow suit. And just now this morning, we hear Stellantis going to put in a new second battery plant at the Kokomo, Indiana facility. The two battery plants there, about $3.2 billion in investment, 1,400 workers.But yes, you know that Sean Fein will be eyeing this deal. Maybe he might mention it on Friday when he does this other update potentially saying, hey, we're watching you guys with these battery plants. We saw GM has agreed to potentially add these battery plants to the mass agreement. Will Stellantis follow suit? We'll see. Maybe they might actually put the hurt on them potentially with more stand strikes.]"

Meanwhile, GM in Canada gets a reprieve from Unifor members. And on the Stellantis (STLA) front: the company said it will expand its battery production plans in the US — a key point of issue as UAW contract talks continue.As the current UAW strike against the Big Three (GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis) enters a 27th day, more UAW members at other companies have been pushing for better terms. UAW members at Mack Trucks rejected a deal and went on strike just this week, and late Tuesday night UAW members at defense contractor General Dynamics voted to authorize a strike in case a new deal isn’t reached.In a letter posted by UAW president Shawn Fain to General Dynamics union members, Fain said 97% of members voted to authorize a strike in case a new deal isn’t reached by the contract expiration deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday, Oct. 22.General Dynamics employs around 1,100 UAW members at plants located in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. If these workers eventually go on strike, they will join the approximately 4,400 Mack Trucks workers striking currently who are not part of the UAW’s Big Three stand up strikes. UAW actions against the Big Three involve around 25,000 striking auto workers at the moment.Now GM has been given something of a reprieve, however, across the border. Canada’s Unifor auto union, after going on strike for about half a day, reached a tentative deal with GM.GM's Oshawa assembly complex where 4,300 unionized workers went on strike at three General Motors plants, including Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. (Arlyn McAdorey/REUTERS) (Arlyn McAdorey / reuters)GM agreed to terms similar to those Ford reached with Unifor, with the union using the Ford deal as a “pattern agreement” for negotiations. If the deal is voted through, Unifor’s 4,300 GM workers will get 20% base hikes in pay, reactivation of COLA benefits next year, wage progression reduced by half to four years, conversion of some temps to full time, and other concessions.Is that progress? Maybe.Story continuesLast week, UAW president Fain did not expand strikes against the Big Three. He said a major concession was made by GM: The automaker supposedly said it would allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to unionize. This was a major move as it would likely mean Ford and Stellantis would have to agree to similar terms in the collective bargaining process as the entire industry transforms itself from gas-powered cars to electrified vehicles.Battery plant expansion is a worry for the UAW. (Carlos Osorio/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)And only a few days later on Wednesday morning, Stellantis announced that it and battery partner Samsung SDI will invest over $3.2 billon to “co-locate” a new battery plant in Kokomo, Ind., alongside another gigafactory currently under construction.Stellantis said this second “StarPlus” gigafactory will start producing batteries in 2027, and employ 1,400 workers; the first StarPlus gigafactory in Kokomo is expected to start production in Q1 of 2025.This announcement will certainly not go unnoticed at UAW’s “Solidarity House” headquarters in Detroit, where Fain and his executive committee see new battery and joint-venture gigafactories as an existential threat to the union — if workers at those new plants can’t unionize, of course.Next from Fain? Expect another UAW stand up strike update this Friday. He'll more likely than not put the spotlight on Stellantis’s latest battery plant move.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This company, which is in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This defense contractor has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3.69%.For the last reported quarter, General Dynamics came out with earnings of $2.70 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59 per share, representing a surprise of 4.25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.56 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.64 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.13%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for General Dynamics lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.General Dynamics currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.14%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 25, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including United Parcel Service, Inc., Booking Holdings Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS. The company's strong free cash flow generating ability is encouraging and supports its shareholder-friendly activities.(You can read the full research report on United Parcel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+49.3% vs. +33.2%). The company is benefiting from a substantial improvement in booking trends driven by growing demand for travel. This, in turn, is helping lower cancellation rates.Booking Holdings expects room night growth to increase at a low double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results. An uncertainty regarding the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CME Group Inc. and General Dynamics Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

On an annual basis that would leave core CPI at 4.1%, its lowest level in two years.That would be welcome news for the U.S. central bank, but the path to lower inflation, and a return to the 2% target, looks trickier from here.The threat of higher energy prices following the outbreak of a war between Israel and Palestinian militants is all too real, even if the immediate market reaction has been relatively muted.Oil rose by as much as 4% at one point on Monday, but has since returned to levels it was at before Hamas militants crossed the Israeli border on Saturday.Natural gas prices in Europe and the U.S. are both holding near multi-month highs as there is already evidence that supply could be affected, after the Israeli energy ministry instructed Chevron to shut-in production at its Tamar facility.Policymakers around the globe are likely to signal they will look through any short-term boost to inflation if the conflict were to escalate, but the path back to 2% could still take longer than previously thought.Elsewhere on the calendar, the account of the European Central Bank's September policy decision, when it raised its deposit rate to a record high of 4%, will be released at 1130 GMT/0730 ET.Story continuesMarkets now expect that to be the ECB's last move in the tightening cycle and commentary since has done little to dissuade that view.""I do believe that policy at this moment is in a good place,"" said Klaas Knot on Wednesday. Knot is often perceived one of the more hawkish governing council members.For now, equities in Europe are broadly higher, futures in the U.S. are pointing to a positive open, while the dollar is flat after a six-day streak of daily losses.Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:* U.S. CPI, jobless claims* U.S. 30-year bond auction* Earnings from Walgreens Boots Alliance, Delta Air Lines* ECB monetary policy accounts(Reporting by Samuel Indyk Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 28 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 8, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.88 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.88 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.75 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Wynn Resorts has an Earnings ESP of 18.1%.WYNN is one of just a large database of Consumer Discretionary stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Cinemark Holdings (CNK).Cinemark Holdings is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 3, 2023. CNK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.56 a share 23 days from its next earnings release.Cinemark Holdings' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 70.56% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33.Story continuesWYNN and CNK's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

If you want to see some more of the world’s biggest asset managers, go directly to the 5 Biggest Publicly Traded Asset Managers.An asset manager handles combined funds for their clients, investing them accordingly. While hedge funds may be the most widely recognized type of asset management company, there exist various other categories of asset managers, including those overseeing mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds.In 2022, asset managers encountered a challenging period as assets under management (AuM) plummeted to $115.1 trillion, marking a nearly 10% decrease from the 2021 peak of $127.5 trillion. This decline was the most substantial in a decade. Looking ahead to the coming two years, inflation, market volatility, and shifts in interest rates are the primary concerns for both investors and asset managers. Nonetheless, PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, anticipates a recovery by 2027, projecting AuM to attain a base case of $147.3 trillion, showcasing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%.As we move further into the second half of the year, the stock market is beginning to reflect the expected impacts of the impending recession, aligning with predictions from J.P. Morgan Research. The firm anticipates a gradual economic decline in the United States by late 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, resulting in tighter credit conditions that will gradually dampen economic growth. While many stocks are on a downward trend, certain industries are flourishing despite this economic strain, presenting attractive investment opportunities for global investors. Some noteworthy sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, and DIY, along with related industries.The asset and wealth management sector is undergoing significant transformations due to a range of hurdles, including pressure on fees, escalating costs, and shifting investor preferences. These challenges are further heightened by market instability, increasing interest rates, inflation, and impending economic downturns. Nevertheless, the fundamental foundation of the industry remains robust, offering potential for appealing profitability. Moreover, there's a growing interest in alternative investments, thematic investment demands, and a preference for digital engagement. To capitalize on opportunities within the asset management domain, some top publicly traded options for investors include the likes of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).Story continuesBiggest Publicly Traded Asset ManagersPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this list of the 25 biggest publicly traded asset managers in the world, we used the rankings of The SWFI and ranked institutions by the total managed AUM.

While the company’s revenues are expected to have witnessed an increase in the quarter on a year-over-year basis, earnings are likely to have declined.In the last reported quarter, BK’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by a rise in net interest revenues and marginally lower expenses. However, the assets under management (AUM) balance witnessed a decline, which, along with lower fee revenues, hurt the results to some extent.BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with a surprise of 8.3%, on average.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.15, which has been revised almost 1% lower over the past seven days. The consensus estimate indicates a decline of 5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for third-quarter earnings is pinned at $1.14 per share.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.31 billion, implying a 0.8% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $4.33 billion.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3Fee Revenues: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fee (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.22 billion, reflecting a rise of 2.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $2.27 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 5.4%.The consensus mark for financing-related fees is pegged at $48.94 million, which suggests a 13.8% year-over-year rise. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $48.8 million, indicating a rise of 13.5%.The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $34.84 million, indicating a 5.6% rise from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $34.9 million.The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues is pegged at $150 million, suggesting a decline of 26.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $156.4 million, indicating a 23% decline. The consensus mark for investment and other income of $75 million suggests a year-over-year decline of 35.9%.Thus, the consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is pegged at $3.28 billion, suggesting a decline of 2.1% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. We project the metric to be $3.32 billion.Net Interest Revenues (NIR): The overall lending scenario remained weak in the to-be-reported quarter amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve continued to tighten its monetary policy, increasing interest rates by another 25 basis points in the third quarter. The policy rate now stands at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5%. While the inversion of the yield curve and rising funding costs are expected to have weighed on margins to some extent, BK’s interest income is likely to have improved in the quarter, supported by higher rates.The consensus mark for the third-quarter NIR is pegged at $1.01 billion, indicating 9.3% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for NIR is also pinned at $1.01 billion.Expenses: Because of higher restructuring charges, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Nevertheless, overall costs are expected to have been manageable in the quarter under review, given the elimination of unnecessary management layers.Our estimate for third-quarter non-interest expenses is $3.15 billion, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 14.5%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is -1.41%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks That Warrant a LookA couple of finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +2.11% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

VGP members can now access innovative digital features and marketing solutions, coupled with financing options, to expand their practices.This move bodes well for Synchrony Financial, as wider adoption of CareCredit is expected to boost the top line in the future. With SYF’s CareCredit expansion, it is evident that the company is focused on expanding the business with attention paid to health systems. Health and Wellness accounted for 16% of the total interest and fees on loans of SYF in the second quarter of 2023. This move will also lead to increased contributions from this segment and a rise in the loan receivables portfolio, paving the way for higher interest income and fees on loans. The company expects loan receivables growth of more than 10% in 2023.Synchrony Financial’s CareCredit will provide flexible financial solutions to pet owners and provide efficient and seamless service to vet practices and pet owners. Synchrony Financial will also offer education opportunities and member-only events to members of VGP and an opportunity to collaborate for marketing, co-branding, improve productivity. Pet parents can check if they prequalify for a CareCredit credit card without impacting their credit score in real time. They can apply on any smart device or over their phone. Once approved, pet parents can make the payment immediately. Short-term and long-term promotional financing options will be available depending on the purchase amount.Partnerships similar to the latest one are expected to boost the presence of CareCredit across the pet care space. CareCredit is presently offered in 25,000-plus vet practices in the United States, and expanding the reach of CareCredit financing solutions also bolsters the purchasing power of consumers. It reduces hurdles for patients in availing of quality health care.

The company's innovations in digital communications, networking, and mobile technologies have been instrumental in the growth and evolution of the global wireless industry. Qualcomm's business operations span across various sectors, including semiconductors, intellectual property, and software and services.The insider's recent sell-off raises questions about the company's current valuation and future prospects. Let's delve deeper into the insider trading trends and the company's valuation to gain a better understanding.Insider Sell: Qualcomm Inc's Chief Commercial Officer James Cathey Sells 1,000 SharesThe insider trading history for Qualcomm Inc shows a clear trend of more sells than buys over the past year. There have been 11 insider sells and no insider buys during this period. This trend could indicate that insiders believe the company's shares are overvalued, prompting them to sell their holdings.On the day of the insider's recent sell, Qualcomm Inc's shares were trading at $112.28, giving the company a market cap of $122.3 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 14.56, lower than both the industry median of 23.5 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio.

Essentially, investors can get the best of both worlds, leveraging the power of digitalization combined with passive income.Increasingly, the market appears to reward a conservative framework rather than a guns-blazing pathway to business expansion. Yes, the Federal Reserve may be in a position to facilitate a soft landing. However, that’s far from a guaranteed outcome. Therefore, innovators may feel the heat, which may cynically bode well for tech stocks that pay dividends.At their core, tech firms aim to bring practical solutions to the field, dramatically enhancing convenience and/or productivity. However, many of these entities suffer from financial viability concerns. And that’s where passive income provides a distinguishing attribute. Generally, companies that pay dividends feature established businesses.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that in mind, you can have your cake and eat it too with these tech stocks that pay dividends.IBM (IBM)Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.Source: shutterstock.com/LCVAdmittedly, IBM (NYSE:IBM) doesn’t exactly engender confidence. While so many tech juggernauts generated significant returns so far this year, IBM can’t keep its head above water. Since the January opener, IBM lost 0.34%. Still, the legacy stalwart deserves more respect. As one of the top players in artificial intelligence and machine learning, the company offers significant long-term potential.Also, after suffering from frustrating consolidation patterns amid certain business pressures, an argument can be made that shares of “Big Blue” may offer contrarian value. It’s not an unreasonable proposition either. According to investment data aggregator Gurufocus, IBM trades with a forward earnings multiple of 13.96, conspicuously below the sector median of 22.33.Should the wheels start turning regarding capital gains, investors will more readily appreciate IBM’s forward yield. At 4.71%, that’s well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%.Story continuesTo be fair, IBM carries a consensus rating of hold, with a price target of $147.27 implying only 4% upside. Still, contrarians might want to give this overlooked name among tech stocks that pay dividends a try.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor signSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.comAnother powerhouse innovator that just hasn’t gotten off on the right foot in 2023, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) arguably deserves a better standing. Since the January opener, QCOM gained just under 2.5%, which is quite lackluster. Also, in the trailing one-year period, shares slipped 12%. Earlier this year, concerns about broader economic headwinds have clouded semiconductor specialists.At the core, industry experts warned that demand for smartphones and PCs may remain weak all year. That’s not a surprising outlook given the pressures associated with simultaneously high inflation and high borrowing costs. Nevertheless, it may also present an intriguing opportunity for contrarians. Right now, shares trade at only 11.93x forward earnings, below the semiconductor industry’s median value of 20x.On the passive income side, Qualcomm carries a forward yield of 2.91%. Even better, it features a history of 21 years of consecutive dividend increases.Finally, analysts peg QCOM as a moderate buy with a $135.62 target, implying over 23% upside potential.Garmin (GRMN)Garmin company logo on a storefrontSource: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.comA multinational tech firm, Garmin (NYSE:GRMN) is perhaps best known for its consumer innovations. Thanks to its development of wearable tech, Garmin has been a strong competitor in the activity tracker and smartwatch markets. In addition, the company specializes in GPS solutions for the automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and sports activities segments.On the surface, GRMN has been a better performer than many other tech stocks that pay dividends. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained a bit over 11%. In the past 365 days, they swung up more than 25%. Still, Garmin may bring relative value to the table.Specifically, its three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 8.6%, above 62% of its direct peers. Yet it also trades at 20.14x trailing earnings, below the sector median of 21.5x. Of course, we also must factor ink in passive income, with GRMN carrying a forward yield of 2.8%. Lastly, analysts rate shares as a moderate buy with a $129 price target, implying nearly 24% growth.Adtran (ADTN)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA fiber networking and telecommunications firm, Adtran (NASDAQ:ADTN) specializes in delivering scalable, end-to-end fiber networking solutions for communication service providers, enterprises, and government customers. Through its relatively recent directive, Adtran offers comprehensive service portfolios that bolster connectivity for residences, businesses, and 5G infrastructures. While a relevant cog of the broader tech ecosystem, ADTN also presents high risks.Since the start of the year, ADTN fell 57%, a simply staggering loss. Part of the pain centers on underwhelming results for its second quarter. As well, management issued a tough warning about customers optimizing inventory amid a difficult macroeconomic environment. Still, Adtran does bring positives, such as a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.1%, beating out 76.43% of its peers.Notably, the company features a forward yield of 4.45%. Again, that’s well above the tech sector’s average yield of 1.37%. One thing to keep in mind, though, is the payout ratio of 64.86%. While not outrageously high, it’s not exactly low either. But to end on a positive, analysts rate ADTN as a moderate buy with a $10.33 target, implying almost 27% upside.L3Harris Technologies (LHX)L3Harris (LHX) sign outsideSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA defense contractor and information technology services provider, L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) garnered its reputation through advanced command and control systems and products. As well, L3Harris features expertise in wireless equipment, tactical radios, avionics, and electronic systems, and night vision equipment, among other product categories. Despite exceptional relevancies, LHX fell nearly 21% since the January opener.It’s not entirely clear what’s causing the volatility. For instance, in late July, L3Harris disclosed its results for the second quarter, beating analysts’ targets for both the top and bottom lines. As well, management updated its 2023 outlook, raising its revenue and earnings expectations. However, it’s possible that investors didn’t like that the bottom line decreased 8% in Q2 against the prior year.Still, the red ink does make LHX trade at a forward multiple of 12.38x. Also, the company offers a forward yield of 2.78%, along with a sustainable payout ratio that sits at 34%. In closing, analysts peg LHX as a moderate buy with a $215.83 target, implying nearly 32% upside potential. For speculators, it could be an intriguing idea among tech stocks that pay dividends.Open Text (OTEX)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockBased in Canada, Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) develops and sells enterprise information management software. Per its public profile, Open Text is also Canada’s fourth-largest software firm as of 2022. It also happens to garner recognition as one of our northern neighbor’s top employers. Since the start of this year, OTEX gained 15%, which initially seems compelling.Unfortunately, Open Text has raised some questions lately. In the trailing one-month period, OTEX gave up almost 14% of equity value. Thus, it’s one of the higher-risk, higher-reward ideas among tech stocks that pay dividends. Still, if you’re willing to take the chance, OTEX runs a forward earnings multiple of 7.24x, well lower than the software sector’s 22.33x median value.Also, it’s worth pointing out that Open Text features a three-year revenue growth rate of 12.4%, above 60.38% of its rivals. As for passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 2.89%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts rate shares a strong buy with a $50.86 target, implying 47% upside.Himax Technologies (HIMX)Shipping label of a box from Himax. HIMX stock.Source: Mamat Suryadi / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Tainan City, Taiwan, Himax Technologies (NASDAQ:HIMX) is a leading supplier and fabless semiconductor manufacturer. Specifically, Himax specializes in display imaging processing solutions. As the leading provider of display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers, the company commands wide applications, from laptops, to mobile phones, car navigation, and many other sectors.However, Wall Street doesn’t really recognize the viability of Himax’s business at the moment. Since the January opener, HIMX slipped more than 7%. In the trailing one-month period, HIMX fell more than 3%, reflecting the ho-hum nature of tech these days. Nevertheless, Himax may offer deep value for contrarians. Right now, shares trade at only 9.49x forward earnings.It’s also not a “cheap” undervaluation. What I mean is that operationally, Himax is robust, with a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.8%. In addition, HIMX carries a forward yield of 8.18%. That said, you should watch the payout ratio of 92.48%.Finally, analysts rate HIMX a moderate buy with a $9 target, implying over 53% upside. For intrepid gamblers, Himax could be one of the most rewarding tech stocks that pay dividends.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This makes the dividend yield 2.7%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Lockheed Martin was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 5.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 45%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendLockheed Martin Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $4.60 total annually to $12.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Lockheed Martin has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 27% per annum. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Lockheed Martin Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Lockheed Martin is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Leerink upgraded Amgen (AMGN) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $318, up from $267, noting that the rating change is both a multiple-expansion and earnings-upside call.Raymond James upgraded Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $170 price target. Following a ""relatively slower period"" in front-line releases, the firm sees a number of reasons to become incrementally more optimistic in the company's near- and medium-term path forward.BofA upgraded PNC Financial (PNC) to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $121 as part of a broader research note on U.S. Banks. The company's relative capital positioning is a significant positive, which should allow PNC to capture market share opportunities, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Signature's loan portfolio, the firm says.Goldman Sachs upgraded Shoals Technologies (SHLS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $28, up from $27, implying 85% upside from current levels. The firm is ""tactically more bullish,"" saying the overhang from recent warranty expense issues appear to be priced into the shares.B. Riley upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $51, up from $37. The firm admits to underestimating the value of the company's silicon carbide business, saying transaction with Denso and Mitsubishi Electric values the silicon carbide business at $3B, or 10-times fiscal 2024 revenue.(Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Top 5 Downgrades:Oppenheimer downgraded Texas Instruments (TXN) to Perform from Outperform without a price target ahead of the fiscal Q3 report on October 24. The firm sees sustained margin pressure as the company invests in capacity.Piper Sandler downgraded Arista Networks (ANET) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $190. The firm has concerns around 2024 networking spend and says Arista's valuation is reflecting a more balanced risk/reward profile at these levels.Raymond James downgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $520, down from $600. The firm believes the stock's significant outperformance year-to-date sets up a more balanced risk/reward scenario relative to historical levels.BofA downgraded Timken (TKR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $74, down from $100, as the firm sees a ""no pain, no gain"" theme as it looks towards 2024 in its Machinery, E&amp;C and Waste coverage.JPMorgan downgraded RXO Inc. (RXO) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $16, down from $17. The firm continues to see material risk to consensus estimates, especially in a lower for longer freight rate environment.Story continuesAn F-35A Lockheed Martin fighter jet lands on a motorway, in Tervo, Finland September 21, 2023.

The conflict started with Hamas launching sudden missile attacks on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, to which Israel’s military responded with multiple airstrikes on Gaza strip.This unprecedented assault by Hamas and the retaliatory strikes from Israel are poised to be beneficial for U.S. defense stocks, especially those that are notable weapons suppliers to Israel. Evidently, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense Index surged a solid 6.7%, following the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict. This, in turn, puts the spotlight on major weapon manufacturers like Lockheed Martin LMT, RTX Corp. RTX, Boeing BA and L3Harris Technologies LHX.U.S. Support to IsraelAmerica has been a patronizer for Israel, aiding in promoting the country’s economic prosperity and regional security for many years. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the United States signed a landmark agreement with Israel in 2016. Per the contract, the United States pledged to offer military aid worth $38 billion to Israel over a period of 10 years.Israel has to spend $1.2 billion per year on the advanced military equipment that only the United States can provide. Obviously, this enhanced the inflow of U.S.-made weapons in Israel, thereby bolstering the U.S. defense majors’ profits from international markets.In view of the recent scenario, U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to provide additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors, to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and citizens, as stated in a CNBC report. Notably, the first plane carrying U.S. ammunition and military supplies has already landed at an air base in Southern Israel.Moreover, considering the fact that there are quite a few U.S. citizens among the hostages that Hamas has taken over the past couple of days, America has also enhanced its military force in the region to strengthen deterrence.Story continuesU.S. Defense Stocks to GainConsidering the current military instability in Southern Israel, there’s a high possibility of witnessing further hostility among the two parties. This, in turn, offers more growth opportunities for the following defense stocks.Lockheed Martin: LMT offers its C-130 and F-16 aircraft to Israel that the Israel Air Force has been using since the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Israel is the owner of the largest fleet of F-16 fighters outside the United States.In light of the current situation, LMT’s shares have risen 8.6% since Oct 6, following Hamas’ latest strike on Israel. To tackle the ongoing violence in Southern Israel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin recently ordered more of Lockheed-built F-35 and F-16 fighter aircraft to squadrons in the region.RTX Corp.: Its Missiles &amp; Defense unit, along with Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, manufactures the Iron Dome Weapon System. Notably, 10 Iron Dome batteries protect the citizens and infrastructure of Israel. These two companies also co-manufacture David’s Sling System, which forms a crucial element of Israel’s multi-tier layered missile defense architecture to provide mid-tier regional missile defense.RTX’s shares have risen 5.1% since Oct 6. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that military supplies already flowing into Israel contain interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense.Boeing: Israel Aerospace Industries’ major structures work for Boeing’s F-15 program, avionics and spare parts for the V-22 Osprey, the T-38 Talon and T-45 Goshawk. In 2022, the company was awarded contracts to deliver four KC-46A tankers to Israel.BA’s shares have risen 3.3% since Oct 6. Following Hamas’ attack on Israel, Boeing has sped up the delivery of 1,000 smart bombs to the latter, per a report from Fox News. Meanwhile, Mr. Austin’s order also included the deployment of more F-15s in the region. This should boost Boeing, these jets’ manufacturer.L3Harris Technologies: In July 2023, L3Harris announced that it is expanding its partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries’ ELTA Systems Group (ELTA) to provide leading-edge, U.S. and NATO interoperable Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) solutions.The companies are offering a missionized Bombardier Global 6500, integrated by L3Harris, with ELTA’s latest next-generation AEW systems and operationally-proven Battle Management Command and Control Suite. The Global 6500 AEW&amp;C will fly higher, faster, longer and at a lower cost (to sustain, operate and maintain) than the existing AEW&amp;C platforms.LHX’s shares have risen 8.3% since Oct 6. Following the ongoing violence, we may expect further development in the aforementioned partnership to boost Israel’s airborne surveillance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GD.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Stock Reports for UPS, Booking Holdings and Lockheed MartinThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including United Parcel Service, Inc., Booking Holdings Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS. The company's strong free cash flow generating ability is encouraging and supports its shareholder-friendly activities.(You can read the full research report on United Parcel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+49.3% vs. +33.2%). The company is benefiting from a substantial improvement in booking trends driven by growing demand for travel. This, in turn, is helping lower cancellation rates.Booking Holdings expects room night growth to increase at a low double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results. An uncertainty regarding the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CME Group Inc. and General Dynamics Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

BAX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAXIs Baxter International Inc (BAX) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthWhat Is the GF Score?The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.Financial strength rank: 4/10Profitability rank: 7/10Growth rank: 5/10GF Value rank: 4/10Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Baxter International Inc the GF Score of 68 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Baxter International Inc BusinessBaxter International Inc, with a market cap of $17.18 billion, is a prominent player in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. The company, which reported sales of $15.02 billion, offers a variety of medical instruments and supplies to caregivers. It enhanced its portfolio of hospital-focused offerings by acquiring Hillrom in late 2021. Legacy Baxter offers tools to help patients with acute and chronic kidney failure. It also sells a variety of injectable therapies for use in care settings, such as IV pumps, administrative sets, and solutions; nutritional products; and surgical sealants and hemostatic agents. The company offers contract manufacturing services to pharmaceutical companies. The Hillrom transaction has added basic equipment, including hospital beds, to the portfolio, although about half of Hillrom's 2021 revenue came from more digitally connected offerings like its smart beds and Voalte medical communications app.Story continuesIs Baxter International Inc (BAX) Set to Underperform? Analyzing the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownBaxter International Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 1.16 positions it worse than 94.76% of 420 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Score is just 1.56, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.1 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 3.04, which is worse than 98.18% of 659 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations.Next StepsGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Baxter International Inc has a rich history and a diverse portfolio, its financial indicators suggest that it may struggle to maintain its past performance. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.Is Baxter International (BAX) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapA Deeper Look into Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX)Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Baxter International should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.56. These indicators suggest that Baxter International, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Decoding the Altman Z-ScoreInvented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX)Baxter offers a variety of medical instruments and supplies to caregivers.

A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapAnalyzing Baxter International's Financial HealthA dissection of Baxter International's Altman Z-score reveals Baxter International's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Baxter International's historical data, 2021: 0.85; 2022: 0.54; 2023: 0.49, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Baxter International's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Baxter International's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.04; 2023: -0.09) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Baxter International might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.When it comes to operational efficiency, a vital indicator for Baxter International is its asset turnover. The data: 2021: 0.62; 2022: 0.51; 2023: 0.52 from the past three years suggests a decreasing trend in this ratio. The asset turnover ratio reflects how effectively a company is using its assets to generate sales. Therefore, a drop in this ratio can signify reduced operational efficiency, potentially due to underutilization of assets or decreased market demand for the company's products or services. This shift in Baxter International's asset turnover underlines the need for the company to reassess its operational strategies to optimize asset usage and boost sales.ConclusionIn conclusion, despite its seemingly attractive valuation, Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX) exhibits several risk factors that suggest it may be a potential value trap. The company's low Altman Z-Score, declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, and decreasing asset turnover ratio all point towards possible financial distress and reduced operational efficiency. Therefore, thorough due diligence is highly recommended before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The two discuss why Duato thinks J&amp;J is in its ""golden era"", as well as the potential of J&amp;J's consumer brands to compete with companies like L'Oreal. Duato talks about J&amp;J's ongoing R&amp;D in the areas of robotics and AI.In the second half of the episode, Fortune CEO Alan Murray talks to Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen about the current state of the economy. They discuss the narrow avoidance of a full government shutdown, U.S. and global investment in industrial development of products such as semiconductors, and generative AI and how it may affect productivity. Yellen also shares her predictions for interest rates, job creation, and the economy as a whole.Co-hosts Alan Murray and Michal Lev-Ram provide context and reflect on the conversations throughout the episode.Listen to the episode or read the full transcript below.Transcript[music starts]Alan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte, who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change.Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I’m Alan Murray.[music ends]Michal Lev-Ram: And I’m Michal Lev-Ram. Alan, I see you're back in New York after a whirlwind few days in D.C. There was so much going on there, including our very own Fortune CEOI conference. I wasn't able to attend, and I always have major FOMO when I miss any of our live events, but I want to know, how was it? What were the highlights?Murray: Michal, it was really, really good. So for listeners who don't know, the Fortune CEO Initiative was created seven years ago to give CEOs of purpose-driven companies that really want to focus on improving their positive social impact on society, give them a forum where they could exchange ideas and best practices. We had about 100 CEOs in the room, and a killer program. You know, we're gonna do a couple of those interviews here in a moment. But the thing I want to tell you is, I mean, we were talking about climate programs, we were talking about the political backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion. We had the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Treasury talking about the new industrial policy. But we kept coming back again and again to your favorite topic, which is generative AI. It's clearly so obsessing the minds of business leaders right now, it was actually almost hard to get away from it.Story continuesLev-Ram: Okay. Well, you did cover a lot of ground though. And I know AI is super top of mind. But one of the interviews that we're really interested in sharing with all of you was an interview that our editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell did with Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO, Joaquin Duato. Tell us a little bit about that one.Murray: Well, it was a great interview, Alyson did a really nice job. I mean, the thing about Johnson &amp; Johnson is it has been a purpose-driven company for many years. It has this famous credo that they really train everyone at the company in, and Joaquin was a perfect representative of that credo. I think you'll get that in this conversation.Lev-Ram: And just for some background, Joaquin became CEO of J&amp;J in early 2022. But he joined the company 34 years ago as part of Janssen Pharmaceuticals in his native Spain. He took over the company during a pretty rocky time for J&amp;J, when the U.S. government had phased out the company's COVID-19 vaccine that hurt its pharmaceutical division. There are some other hurdles as well, including, you know, we all know about this settlement: $9 billion class action lawsuit, alleging that J&amp;J is baby powder had caused cancer. So lots of hurdles there. And I'm curious after listening to his conversation with Alyson, do you think Duato is up to the task?Murray: I thought he was impressive. I mean, Alyson definitely asked him about the challenges that you talked about, and how he led in the face of this kind of tumult. And he was very straight and very clear. And again, harken back to the Johnson &amp; Johnson credo and its purpose, and then went on to say that he thinks the company is actually about to enter its golden era.Lev-Ram:Well, here it is the first of two interviews we're going to bring out from COEI Johnson &amp; Johnson's Joaquin Duato in conversation with Fortune editor in chief Alyson Shontell. And later on, we're going to also hear from Janet Yellen which Alan I hear you have a special relationship with…Murray: More on that later. Let's listen to Joaquin Duato.[music starts][music ends]Alyson Shontell: Joaquin, thank you so much for being here with us. So first, I should note Johnson &amp; Johnson has been one of 49 companies to be in the Fortune 500 list every single year since we've made it since 1955. This year, they clocked in at No. 40. As Alan said, the health care and pharma markets have been booming. And you've been in the job for two years, but you've been at the company for 34. So you've seen quite a bit. Two years in, what's your primary focus and biggest surprise since becoming CEO?Joaquin Duato: Thank you, Alyson. I'm proud to be the CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson. In our 130 years of history. We have had only eight CEOs. And I'm the first one who is not born in the U.S. and I'm proud to represent that. And certainly it's a great legacy that we have had during this period. So In becoming CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, I have a dual purpose. One is to remain a company that is true to our mission of addressing difficult to treat diseases. And the other one is to be able to continue to be a company, which is a principle based people base and maintains the reputation that we have had during such a long period of time.Shontell: Now, is it true that you didn't get the job at first, I mean, at the CEO job, but you initially when you were interviewing 34 years ago-They said, No!Duato: It's true. When I finished graduate school, I interviewed with Johnson &amp; Johnson, and I didn't make it to the second interview. So then I joined another company, a pharmaceutical company,and eventually found my way back to Johnson &amp; Johnson and I be here for 34 years.Shontell: I mean, the longevity of your career there, I think is telling and the attrition rate is shockingly low at Johnson &amp; Johnson, right?Duato: Yeah, it's very low. It's lower than the industry and our peer companies. And I think there's a number of reasons for having low attrition. One is the size of the company that enables people to work in different sectors and have careers within Johnson &amp; Johnson. Sometimes I say, Johnson &amp; Johnson has its internal job market. The other one is that people simply like to work for Johnson &amp; Johnson. Our engagement levels are high. People like to work for a company with a purpose in health care. We are a company that pays a lot of attention to inclusion. So everybody feels good when they come to work. And certainly we like to believe that we are a caring company, that we care not only for the patients, but also care for each other. So we try to have a strong health and wellness offering for our employees. So overall people like working in Johnson &amp; Johnson and stay longer in Johnson &amp; Johnson. Our average tenure, for example, in the U.S. is more than a decade. So people can do careers. And we're happy of that. We are glad that people like to stay at Johnson &amp; Johnson longer.Shontell: So when you became CEO, or even in your memo to become CEO, you'd said I think we should spin out consumer business. You're Johnson &amp; Johnson,can compete with L'Oreal there, what should it and so could you speak a little bit about Kenvue, which is the company that you spun out just earlier this year. It's now publicly traded. How you why you did that? Why is returned to focus important for Johnson Johnson versus diversification of businesses?Duato: So Kenvue is our consumer company. So when you think about the Johnson &amp; Johnson on the brands that you know about Johnson &amp; Johnson, BandAids, Tylenol or baby shampoo, now they are all in Kenvue. Why did we decided to separate can be on create a global consumer champion with Kenvue because we thought that focusing on the consumer market and focusing on health care was going to deliver better results for consumers and for patients. For us, it was very complex to be able to compete with L'Oreal, as you mentioned, in skincare, and at the same time competing biologics with biopharmaceutical companies and in surgical robotics, with medical technology companies. So we thought there was a benefit for Johnson &amp; Johnson to be exclusively focused on health care, on research and development on innovation. And that was going to create a better platform for us to be true to our mission, not only in the next two or three years or post IPO, but during a long period of time.Shontell: One thing I do want to make sure I hit on is that R &amp; D is a huge part of Johnson &amp; Johnson. What are you seeing in this space, you've said that this is the golden era for your business, that there will be more change and more positive movements towards curing disease over the next few years than you've seen in the last number of decades. So what are you seeing that's exciting, what are the innovations? And what are you doing with things like robotics, AI? How's that all changing the industry?Duato: Yes, so R &amp;D is the the heart of an innovation based company. Last year, we invested $14.6 billion in R&amp;D and Johnson &amp; Johnson we are one of the largest, if not the largest investor in R&amp;D life sciences. What we see now, it's a combination of more knowledge on the biology and genetics of disease with an acceleration of that due to technology, things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and now generative AI it's helping us accelerate drug discovery, and it's also helping us making medical technology smarter. In the surgical side. Surgeons are now able to utilize robotic assisted techniques, better visualization, better sensors, those instruments are connected, they can provide them in sites, they can significantly improve the average outcome of surgery. So those are things that are going to help accelerate in discovery and progressing in a way that we have not seen in the last century.Shontell: And one thing, we had a lunch previously, and you had mentioned that you imagine knee surgery, but being done by maybe a robot versus a surgeon, I mean, think about the precision needed, I might prefer a robot for something like that, and someone with a potentially shaky hand.Duato: Absolutely all our instruments now have some component of  intelligence or connectivity. So our instruments now have sensors that can measure pressure, temperature to have visualization capabilities, which at the end of the day, software is digital, that give an idea of the surgeon of where they are in, are they going to interfere with a critical structure, and all that can be visualized. And we can even provide guidance to the surgeon real time for where they have to go. So that's going to be transformational in the way we do surgery. And it's going to help improve in the outcomes of a procedure, which is very common, I'm sure in the audience, every one of you have had some type of surgery in your life. So that's important. If we can improve the outcomes and the quality of surgery. When I think about what we can do as a company, we have the range of technologies to be able to do what no other company can do. We can do cell therapy, but we can do robotic surgery we can do. We can do genetic or mRNA therapeutics. And we can do also smart implants. So there's a lot of things that we can do as a company based on the number of technologies and capabilities that we have.Shontell: So as the leader of a company, you have to lead in good times and bad, and with the company's largest Johnson &amp; Johnson, there are hard things, and there are lawsuits. You've had talcum powder, lawsuits and opioid crisis to deal with, COVID, having your vaccine essentially be dismantled. How do you lead in those hard times? How do you encourage your team to not lose morale? Stay focused, stay focused on the mission when there's a lot of hardship around.Duato: Yeah, we do it with conviction, conviction on the principles of our credo that by the way, this year is the 80th anniversary of the credo was written. And we do it by having a trajectory of more than 100 years in which we have always tried to do the right thing for the patient. When we make a mistake, we take responsibility and when the facts, the science and the law are on our side, we stand by our products. And we have been able to manage this, this balance during many years. But the people in the company working at Johnson &amp; Johnson have a genuine passion of doing the right thing. And we don't do it for the recognition. We do it because we have convictions. And those convictions normally help an organization to manage change. I'm convinced that purpose-driven organizations are much better in managing change. And our organization has a strong tradition of being a purpose-driven one we internally we say we are the original, mission driven company, based on the fact that our credo was written 80 years ago. 80 years ago talking about putting the patient first the employees, the communities, and then if you do the right thing, it's going to be good for the shareholder was very innovative, very different. So I think that that's part of the energy that people at Johnson &amp; Johnson have in order to navigate the ups and downs that anything in life it's going to present you with.[music starts][music ends]Lev-Ram: That was a really interesting conversation. I think Joaquin put in such plain language, everything that we explore here on Leadership Next, when he said “purpose-driven companies are better equipped to manage change”. And Alan, I'm wondering if you have thoughts about that?Murray: Well, obviously I agree with that. But I think the other thing that I thought he captured very well was just the sense and there were other leaders in other industries who conveyed this same sense of the conference, that we are on the cusp of something very big here in terms of technological transformation. It will mean a lot to companies like his in the health care business.Lev-Ram: Yea, and I think it's obviously always been a very competitive landscape in  J&amp;J’s space, but it was interesting to me that he also talked about some consumer giants like L'Oreal as a competitor today. And by the way, little teaser here, we have the CEO of L'Oreal on an upcoming episode.Murray:Looking forward to that when I'm sorry, I had to miss that interview.Lev-Ram: Well you get to have FOMO to Alan once in a while.Murray: I do.[music starts]Murray: Jason Girzadas, CEO of Deloitte US is the sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason. Thank you, Alan. It's great to be here. Jason, our ideas about work where we work when we work, how we work, all of those, have continued to evolve since the pandemic. Is that a problem for business? Or is it an opportunity for business?Girzadas: It's a massive opportunity. Although I think the answer is less clear. It is a profound set of challenges to be sure. But in the end, it's an opportunity to create a workplace, particularly in the face of more long term systemic talent workforce constraints and limitations that brings out the best of a workforce. So people can be their genuine self at work and can have heightened levels of productivity and feel supported in all that they do. But I don't think the models are clear. And we're seeing lots of experimentation. Whether that's around hybrid and what does it mean to actually co locate in what degree of co-location matters, it's also a function of how does technology get embedded into the workplace such that employees and workforces feel supported and enabled, and also the cultural elements related to diversity, equity, inclusion and feeling supported to be your genuine self at work. It's the combination Alan, of all those factors that companies will innovate around and find novel ways to bring together that will be highly desirous of leading talent and will be a differentiator in terms of businesses using their workplace, and  their work processes to win in new and different ways.Murray: Jason, thanks for your perspective. And thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next. Thank you.[music ends]Lev-Ram: So Alan, the next conversation we're sharing with our listeners is with someone who, to you, is not just the Secretary of the Treasury or the former chair of the Federal Reserve. So tell us, how do you know Janet Yellen?Murray: Well, it was a long time ago, and I'm not going to say how long it was because that'll say something about both my age and her age. But I got a master's degree in economics at the London School of Economics. And it happened to be the same year she had just gotten married and she and her new husband,George Akerlof, team taught my macro economics course. So for six months, I would go in every day and get a what I'm sure was a brilliant but completely incomprehensible lecture from George Akerlof. And then in the afternoon, Janet Yellen would come in and tidy it all up. And I said to theSsecretary of the Treasury, that what little I know about macro economics, I know from her.Lev-Ram: Not from her husband.Murray: Not from her husband! He's brilliant. Everyone tells me he's brilliant. So I'm sure he must be.Lev-Ram: And hopefully you got a good grade.Murray: I did. I did. I did very well. And and, and she said that it was an honor to have me as a student, which I suspect she says to all her students, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna take it as a personal accolade.Lev-Ram: But, but this was very exciting. She joined you on stage, actually, just a few days after the government narrowly avoided shutting down. It was a thrilling few days for all of us. And overall, it's just a really complicated time for the U.S. and for the U.S. economy for a number of reasons. You know, as we're seeing this unfold, it's gotten even more complex. So as a whole, did you walk away thinking she was optimistic about the state of the economy?Murray: Two things. One is I think she's optimistic. And two is, she still the same person who stood at the front of that classroom, so many years ago, and can take very complicated subjects and make them sound very simple and clear. So it's worth listening to. Here she is. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen.[music starts][music ends]Murray: Really, really appreciate you being here. So we had a wild weekend, you had a wild weekend.Janet Yellen: We're waiting to see whether the government would stay open or shut down.Murray: And we and really all that happened was they kicked the ball down the road 45 days and Moody's is threatening to, to, to downgrade U.S. debt. So I guess the first question for you is, is this mess going to change the relative optimism you had about the U.S. economic outlook?Yellen:Look, I'm very optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook. Short term, inflation is coming down in the context of an extremely strong labor market, what people would normally call a soft landing,Murray: Which is amazing, by the way, it hardly ever happens.Yellen: Correct. And it's great, because, of course, we want to see inflation come down. It's been burdening Americans, but we want to maintain the good strong labor market that we have. And we seem to be on that kind of path. And medium term, we're in Now engaging in a very substantial program of investments to strengthen our economy, to boost our productive capacity, to boost productivity growth, to draw more American workers into the labor market, and to address long standing structural problems, like climate change and inequality across people, races and places.Murray: I want to talk about that. But before I do, I suppose I should let this group in on a little secret about our past. Yeah, which I hesitate to do, because it highlights my age, and may then also highlight yours. But But I have a master's degree in economics, which I got at the London School of Economics for which was the one year that Secretary Yellen taught there. So she, she taught what little I know about macroeconomics, I learned from Janet Yellen. I have wonderful memories of you drawing ISLM curves and Phillips on that big blackboard. Great tools. So So I asked this question. With that in mind, the people who almost hung us up this weekend, are concerned about government spending, we have a budget deficit of one and a half trillion dollars. If I had said to you back when we were at the London School of Economics that we were going to end up in that place, I think you would have used your curves to show me that's not a good scenario. So how is it that that's okay?Yellen: Okay. That's a great question. And as Treasury Secretary, I feel it's my job to worry about fiscal sustainability. So I do think it's critical that we establish spending and revenue targets that put us on a path where fiscal policy is sustainable, and a path that's consistent with solid, solid growth. And I believe at the moment, we're on such a path. So one way to judge it, because our economy is now all about big numbers. And a trillion is certainly a big number. Our economy has a large GDP and so forth. I think the metric that I think is most relevant to judging fiscal sustainability, is the amount that we're spending to service the debt, real net interest payments as a share of GDP, how much of our GDP goes to service the debt? And the answer over the next 10 years in the mid session review, which is the most recent budget forecasts that the administration prepared. The answer is 1%. So real net interest as a share of GDP is about 1%. That's historically, completely normal. Some guidelines would say, try to keep it under 2%. But it's 1%. For the next decade. Now, I will say that that budget does assume meaningful deficit reduction over the next 10 years, there were 3 trillion of deficit reduction incorporated into it, along with a significant program of investments in our economy, but ones that are financed by collecting greater revenues in a way that we think is fair, where the burden largely falls on corporations and very high income taxpayers.Murray: And I do want to come back to the investment piece of it. But before I do, I mean, the other thing that that assumption depends on is how high How long do interest rates stay? Which is a big issue, not just for the government, but for any company that's carrying a substantial amount of debt, how long? Or how long? Are we going to, you know, are we going to have to roll over all our debt at rates that are double what we initially had? So tell them the answer.Yellen: The answer is, I don't know. It's a great question. And it's one that's very much on my end the administration's minds. You know, when the administration came in it was the pandemic, we had had a decade of interest rates, short term interest rates were zero long term interest rates higher but very much lower than today's interest rates. And the interest burden was almost non-existent at that point. Now, the forecasts we’ve made assume that interest rates will rise toward more normal levels. But we are seeing, especially over the last several months, a pretty significant increase in not only tenure nominal yields, but also real yields. And there's a question mark, just why that is.Murray: Why are we going back to something that looks more like the history prior to 10 years ago than the last 10 years?Yellen: That's right. And that's a very, I mean, that's a very important question. One view is that it may take a longer period of somewhat higher interest rates to control inflation to keep it down. But medium term, interest rates will go back to more normal levels. It's also possible that longer term interest rates will be higher than we thought. But I would point out that for many decades, the level of real interest rates not only in the United States, but in many advanced economies had been moving down. Yeah. And it was felt by most economists that there was strong structural reasons why that was occurring.Murray: You know, this is why I loved you as a teacher way back when, because you could explain to me both sides of the equation. The other thing we've been talking about here, today is the extraordinarily quick adoption of generative AI technology. I think Erik Brynjolfsson said earlier that most waves of technology take like 10 years before you start to see him in the productivity numbers, he thinks this one's going to be much faster. We've seen lots of anecdotal evidence of huge productivity gains. If I studied my books correctly, way back then, big increases in productivity could make a huge difference to all the things we're talking about growth, inflation, etc. We've had disappointing productivity for the last decade, are we on the verge of something significantly better?Yellen: So I will say, I'm not an expert in AI From what I understand, as you just said, the progress in this area is unbelievably rapid. And I think it could make a significant difference. As an administration as a country, we're also working on a whole set of investments that should be productivity boosting over the medium term. We're addressing the problem of crumbling roads and highways and an infrastructure that really hasn't been appropriately designed for a modern economy. We have a huge, you know, we passed really a trifecta of legislation, the bipartisan Infrastructure bill, the Chips and Semiconductor Act, and then the Inflation Reduction Act. So we're investing in R&amp;D in ways we haven't in decades, restoring us Leadership in Science and Technology.Murray: So you’re betting on a significant increase in productivity?Yellen: Yes, but let me be careful because productivity growth, usually a 10th or two here is there is regarded as a big a big thing. So I don't want to pull numbers out of a hat that are gigantic. I think there will be a payoff, but I don't want to exaggerate.[music starts][music ends]Lev-Ram: Alan, Secretary Yellen does sound optimistic. But I'm curious. What about you? How are you feeling about the current state of the economy, not just after your conversation with her but after COEI in general and after spending a few days in our nation's capital?Murray: Oh, Michal. It's a complicated question. It was certainly mixed. I mean, it is pretty remarkable given that every CEO we talked to six months ago, was predicting a recession, that we are where we are- not in a recession, it looks like the fabled soft landing may actually happen. And that's what she thinks and, and I agree with her, but that doesn't mean there aren't some storm clouds on the horizon. Certainly the fact that interest rates are as high as they are, and seem to be staying there. And so anybody with lots of debt is going to be saddled with extra costs, and we're probably going to see bankruptcies and other problems and she talked about that some as well. But on the good side, going back to AI,Lev-Ram: What bankruptcies, and other problems? Yea, this sounds great!.Murray: You know, we got into geopolitics, but on the good side, and this goes back to AI, the potential for big improvements in in productivity and the macroeconomic effects that has in helping to bring down inflation and increase growth was on everybody's mind.Lev-Ram: Yeah, it was really interesting. You know, I got to watch snippets from afar and follow the coverage. And like you said at the top, I mean, AI was kind of this, this thread throughout and definitely a silver lining. I know obviously, there's a lot to be worked out there and a lot of risks and concerns, but also tons of opportunities, which we heard from both, you know, the DC types and the business types.Murray: Jennifer Tejada, who you know, who's the CEO of PagerDuty, and was our co chair for the conference led a town hall discussion on the AI topic, and she said, I thought this captured it perfectly, that most of the big company CEOs seem to be caught somewhere between FOMO Fear Of Missing Out and FOGI fear of getting in. I thought that was a perfect way of capturing the moment.Lev-Ram: And well we all need new acronyms in our lives. So thank you, Jennifer for that. We definitely want to keep our listeners up to date as the way leaders lead continues to evolve and as the world does, and of course as AI enters the fray more and more.Murray: We certainly will, Michal.

But unlike its 2023 IPO peers, the company has a deep-rooted history.The nearly 250-year-old company plans to offer 10.75 million shares at $46 a share on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""BIRK.""That price, in the middle of its initial range of $44 to $49 per share, sets up the company to raise roughly $1.48 billion. When combined with ordinary shares outstanding after the completion of the offering, it puts Birkenstock's total valuation at $8.6 billion.This is just another chapter for the Germany-based footwear brand. Founded in 1774, the brand's origin story began 249 years ago. Yet, the Birkenstock brand has managed to stay relevant all these years, now going on the ultimate stage.The brand is ""like rediscovering an old vinyl record and realizing it’s a timeless hit,"" Sunny Bonnell, CEO and founder of branding agency Motto, told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""Birkenstock wears its history and values like a badge of honor.""A Birkenstock banner hangs outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York on Oct. 11, 2023, as Birkenstock launches an initial public offering. (ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images)Many of the companies that have gone public in 2023 are not only newcomers to the public market but also have more recent histories.England-based tech company Arm (ARM) was founded as a company in 1990. The Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava (CAVA) opened its first location in 2010. And grocery delivery service company Instacart (CART) launched in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2012, the same year software company Klaviyo (KVYO) was founded.Birkenstock's rich heritage is also deeper than other legacy companies at the time of their IPOs: Goldman Sachs went public 130 years after it was founded, American Express was 127 years old at the time of its public debut, Johnson &amp; Johnson went public at 108 years, and Campbell Soup joined the public markets after 85 years of business.A nearly 250-year-old company goes publicThe Birkenstock brand is older than the United States.According to the company's website, the footwear brand's origin can be traced back to 1774 to Johann Adam Birkenstock, who was listed as ""subject and cobbler"" in the church archives in Langen-Bergheim, Germany.Story continuesMore than 100 years later, in 1896, Johann’s great-great-grandson, Konrad Birkenstock, became known as a ""master cobbler"" and began manufacturing and selling the ""flexible footbed insoles.""In 1902, Konrad created the contoured arch support that Birkenstock is known for, and in 1925, Birkenstock opened a new factory in Friedberg, Germany, to make the ""blue footbed,"" which it still sells today.The business started picking up in the 1960s with the introduction of its first one-strap fitness sandal, called the Madrid Model.In 1966, Birkenstocks came to the US market. Expanding into the US ""provided numerous opportunities for the Birkenstock brand to grow, particularly in California where there was a new culture of young consumers who valued function, purpose and individuality,"" the company said in its S-1 filing.A Birkenstock advertisement in 1972. (Birkenstock)Birkenstock continued to grow. In 2021, brothers Christian Birkenstock and Alex Birkenstock led the decision to sell a majority stake of the company to private equity firm L Catterton, and its affiliates including Bernard Arnault's luxury goods investment company, Financière Agache.The company also named Oliver Reichert, who is now taking the company public, as the sole CEO.""Despite this heritage, Birkenstock remains empowered by a youthful energy level, with all the freshness and creative versatility of an inspired Silicon Valley startup,"" Reichert wrote ahead of Birkenstock's IPO. ""We have retained the original spirit of our forefathers who laid the foundation of a global business that is more relevant than ever before.""Birkenstock today: A multibillion-dollar companyIn fiscal year 2022, the company brought in 1.24 billion euros, growing at an annual rate of 20% from fiscal 2014 to last year. It also sold sold 30 million units in 2022.Word of mouth is the company's biggest marketing strategy. The company said in a filing that its universal nature allows it to appeal to ""a broad range of consumers across age, gender, and socio-economic demographics.""That gives the brand a leg up compared to other brands as well as others in the 2023 IPO class.""Imagine a band that doesn’t advertise yet sells out concerts,"" Bonnell said. ""That’s Birkenstock. When a brand earns trust and love, it’s like igniting a bonfire.""Although the company is on its seventh generation of leadership, it can tap into any age, Bonnell added.""It may seem like the boomer hippie in a room full of millennials and Gen Z, but that's its genius,"" she explained. ""The brand speaks the language of the youth.""Pedestrians pass a Birkenstock store on Oct. 10, 2023, in Venice, Calif. (Ethan Swope/Getty Images) (Ethan Swope via Getty Images)Now, this centuries-old company is being put to the ultimate test.""Maybe this is the real test as to whether the IPO market is reopening for real or whether this was a false storm,"" Ben Laidler, eToro global markets strategist, told Yahoo Finance over the phone.Torch Capital's founder and managing partner Jon Keidan is wary that an ongoing pullback in consumer spending could hurt the company.""Birkenstocks falls into nice-to-have,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live. ""And if people are tightening their belts, that may be the type of purchase that they may not make [in] the next year or two.""Furthermore, Barrett Daniels, US IPO services co-leader at Deloitte, is skeptical about investors' appetite for new players on the market.""I would say it's not a perfect IPO window, but it's a window,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. In light of that, when we looked at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Medtronic:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.072 = US$5.9b ÷ (US$91b - US$9.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).So, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.2%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.7%. View our latest analysis for Medtronic roceIn the above chart we have measured Medtronic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Medtronic here  for free.What Can We Tell From Medtronic's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Medtronic's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Medtronic in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 50% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Medtronic's ROCEIn summary, Medtronic isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. And in the last five years, the stock has given away 14% so the market doesn't look too hopeful on these trends strengthening any time soon. All in all, the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers, so if that's what you're after, we think you might have more luck elsewhere.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Medtronic  that we think you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Neptune, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer, MedtronicBusinesses face rapidly growing, and often contradictory, expectations regarding their role in society. Alongside calls to do more to address deeply rooted societal issues are opposing voices telling companies to ""stay in their lane."" Without clear values as a guide, brands find themselves at an impasse, unsure if they should stay the course or take the next exit.We can debate if these expectations are fair. In most cases, I'd argue they are. Business wields indisputable power to improve circumstances for people and our planet while making a fair profit. At Medtronic we talk about these responsibilities openly, from our Mission written 60 years ago, to our sustainability report published today. (You can read highlights here.)Expectations won't diminish anytime soon, and it's not just external stakeholders applying pressure. A Glassdoor study of job seekers found 86% ""would not consider working for a company with bad social standing."" An Edelman survey of more than 200 Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 1000 Chief Communications Officers revealed employees are ""putting the most pressure on companies to act on social issues"" (61%); ahead of regulators, investors, and NGOs.Navigating these divergent expectations is no small challenge. Executives are faced with a tremendous obligation - to employees, communities, and shareholders - and an unparalleled opportunity. How can leaders chart a path forward? Transparency, accountability, and commitment - what I consider the three non-negotiables of responsible business.TransparencyThe era where any company can simply call itself responsible is behind us - today, business must prove it. Unfortunately, economic anxiety, disinformation, and increased polarization have eroded trust in institutions, and left people feeling vulnerable. As a result, brands are facing increased scrutiny, and the need to build trust is more urgent. Per a special report from Edelman, 71% percent of consumers say, ""it is more important to trust the brands I buy or use today than in the past.""Story continuesAt its core, transparency is about building trust. It's being open and honest, telling people what they can expect, and how your business is upholding its promises. Transparency is easy when the news is good, but even more important when a business falls short. In those honest moments businesses can build trust and even attract new partners and allies who understand goals most worthy of our time and effort are often the hardest to accomplish.This is one reason Medtronic publishes an annual sustainability report and annual inclusion, diversity, and equity report. Through these reports and other channels, we share stories, document our progress, and acknowledge where we need to do more.AccountabilityTransparency means more when tied to clear goals. Perhaps you've heard ""measure what matters"" or read John Doerr's book of the same title. Setting clear targets sends a signal about what matters to a company and provides a framework to publicly hold businesses accountable.This is simply good business. Research shows consumers are more likely to buy from brands that commit to taking actions like improving access to healthcare (7 times more likely), addressing climate change (5 times more likely), and ending racism (4.5 times more likely). But consumers also want action.Aligning with leading reporting frameworks and standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) helps us demonstrate accountability for our impact and share it with our stakeholders. Medtronic also ties our business operations to the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, recognizing the collective power of the private and public sectors to address the world's greatest challenges.CommitmentIn recent years, business has faced criticism for talking too much and not doing enough, on societal issues ranging from racial justice to climate change and income inequality. These are deeply rooted, systemic issues that have been compounding for centuries. Meaningful progress will take years and is possible only through collective action.This doesn't excuse business from inaction. I can't think of a single brand that can't have a positive impact by being conscious of how it conducts its day-to-day business. A responsible business recognizes its power and influence - and uses both accordingly.Medtronic has built our commitments into how we operate. We're doing business with diverse suppliers that reflect the communities we serve, which in turn bolsters their business and local economies. We're leveraging our expertise in healthcare technology to improve healthcare access for underserved communities around the world - including significant investments in Medtronic LABS. And, recognizing innovation is only possible with a diverse and engaged workforce, we're ensuring our hiring and other workforce practices reflect that.Change is constant, and expectations of companies continue to evolve. I believe that's a good thing - for our brands and all our stakeholders. There will likely be rough waters as business continues to navigate its role, but staying focused on transparency, accountability, and commitment will help all of us chart a path forward.Follow Torod Neptune on LinkedIn for additional insights and commentary: https://www.linkedin.com/in/torodneptune/View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/792028/transparency-accountability-commitment-three-non-negotiables-for-responsible-business]"

(NYSE:RSG) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Republic Services Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.02bUS$2.05bUS$2.21bUS$2.44bUS$2.56bUS$2.67bUS$2.77bUS$2.86bUS$2.94bUS$3.02bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.20%Est @ 4.28%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.66% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$17bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.2%) = US$61bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$61b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$31bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$48b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$146, the company appears about fair value at a 3.2% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Republic Services as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.009. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Republic ServicesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

A good example is its Health Indicator feature. This comprehensive indicator provides an overall rating of a stock’s current health.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUsing this metric, you can quickly find potential opportunities to explore. Broken down into three “zones” (green, yellow, and red), you’ll have a general idea about whether it’s best to be bullish, bearish, or neutral on a particular stock.As you may have guessed, stocks in the “Green Zone” are performing well, with little indication that the trend is on the verge of shifting.A stock in the “Yellow Zone” has corrected by more than 50% of its volatility quotient (or VQ), a proprietary TradeSmith metric that helps measure a stock’s risk. When a stock in your portfolio goes from green to yellow, it may be a good time to reassess whether to maintain the position.Stocks entering the “Red Zone” have corrected by more than their calculated volatility quotient. VQ can be useful when adding stop losses to positions. View any move into the “Red Zone” as a warning sign to exit your position for now.These three dividend stocks to watch are currently in the “Green Zone.”Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) has been in the “Green Zone” for over nine months. Shares in the oil and gas pipeline and storage company may be best known for their high dividend yield (7.45%), but the stock has also experienced a solid amount of appreciation (around 11.6%) since the start of the year.You may think this year’s jump in price for EPD stock is due to the recent spike in oil prices, but remember that, as a midstream company, Enterprise Products Partners generates steady cash flow from its operations, irrespective of movements in spot energy prices.Story continuesThat may explain why this EPD is one of the few high-yield stocks with a long track record of dividend growth. The company has increased its dividend 24 years in a row. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for EPD is 16.36%, which makes it a medium-risk stock.International Business Machines (IBM)Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) entered the “Green Zone” just over a month ago. Shares in the tech giant have long been known for being one of the dividend stocks to watch, due to a moderately high yield (4.71%), plus a history of steady dividend increases.That said, growth has been a big issue with IBM stock, weighing on overall total returns.Yet while “Big Blue” has traded sideways for the past five years, its multi-year slump may be entering the rearview mirror. Why? Two reasons.First, IBM is aggressively pursuing opportunities in high-growth areas like hybrid cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence. This could lead to a growth resurgence.Second, as RBC Capital’s Matthew Swanson argued last month, as investors realize that IBM is primarily a software and consulting company now, shares have room to re-rate towards a higher valuation. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for IBM is 15.95%, which makes it a medium-risk stock.Republic Services (RSG)A shot of a Republic Services (RSG) trash truck.Source: Michael T Hartman / Shutterstock.comRepublic Services (NYSE:RSG) has been in the “Green Zone” for more than four months. The waste management company’s shares have performed well in the near term, and could continue to do so over a long time frame. Here’s why.Between the recession-resistant nature of its business, plus continued efforts to grow the business via “bolt-on” acquisitions, a moderate level of earnings growth is likely to continue. Sell-side analysts forecast earnings will grow by double-digits annually in the coming years. RSG stock stands to rise in tandem with this growth.Higher earnings also mean the opportunity for dividend increases. RSG has increased its payout 19 years in a row. While shares yield just 1.49% today, continued dividend growth will push this yield considerably higher over time. This puts shares in the dividend stocks to watch category. TradeSmith’s volatility quotient for RSG is 15.09%, which makes it a medium-risk stock.The TradeSmith Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.TradeSmith’s mission is to put easy-to-use, technology-based tools into the hands of individual, self-directed investors.

Following a ""relatively slower period"" in front-line releases, the firm sees a number of reasons to become incrementally more optimistic in the company's near- and medium-term path forward.BofA upgraded PNC Financial (PNC) to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $121 as part of a broader research note on U.S. Banks.

The firm believes the stock's significant outperformance year-to-date sets up a more balanced risk/reward scenario relative to historical levels.BofA downgraded Timken (TKR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $74, down from $100, as the firm sees a ""no pain, no gain"" theme as it looks towards 2024 in its Machinery, E&amp;C and Waste coverage.JPMorgan downgraded RXO Inc.

To this end, it is imperative to mention that the United States signed a landmark agreement with Israel in 2016. Per the contract, the United States pledged to offer military aid worth $38 billion to Israel over a period of 10 years.Israel has to spend $1.2 billion per year on the advanced military equipment that only the United States can provide. Obviously, this enhanced the inflow of U.S.-made weapons in Israel, thereby bolstering the U.S. defense majors’ profits from international markets.In view of the recent scenario, U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to provide additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors, to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and citizens, as stated in a CNBC report. Notably, the first plane carrying U.S. ammunition and military supplies has already landed at an air base in Southern Israel.Moreover, considering the fact that there are quite a few U.S. citizens among the hostages that Hamas has taken over the past couple of days, America has also enhanced its military force in the region to strengthen deterrence.Story continuesU.S. Defense Stocks to GainConsidering the current military instability in Southern Israel, there’s a high possibility of witnessing further hostility among the two parties. This, in turn, offers more growth opportunities for the following defense stocks.Lockheed Martin: LMT offers its C-130 and F-16 aircraft to Israel that the Israel Air Force has been using since the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Israel is the owner of the largest fleet of F-16 fighters outside the United States.In light of the current situation, LMT’s shares have risen 8.6% since Oct 6, following Hamas’ latest strike on Israel. To tackle the ongoing violence in Southern Israel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin recently ordered more of Lockheed-built F-35 and F-16 fighter aircraft to squadrons in the region.RTX Corp.: Its Missiles &amp; Defense unit, along with Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, manufactures the Iron Dome Weapon System. Notably, 10 Iron Dome batteries protect the citizens and infrastructure of Israel. These two companies also co-manufacture David’s Sling System, which forms a crucial element of Israel’s multi-tier layered missile defense architecture to provide mid-tier regional missile defense.RTX’s shares have risen 5.1% since Oct 6. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that military supplies already flowing into Israel contain interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense.Boeing: Israel Aerospace Industries’ major structures work for Boeing’s F-15 program, avionics and spare parts for the V-22 Osprey, the T-38 Talon and T-45 Goshawk. In 2022, the company was awarded contracts to deliver four KC-46A tankers to Israel.BA’s shares have risen 3.3% since Oct 6. Following Hamas’ attack on Israel, Boeing has sped up the delivery of 1,000 smart bombs to the latter, per a report from Fox News. Meanwhile, Mr. Austin’s order also included the deployment of more F-15s in the region. This should boost Boeing, these jets’ manufacturer.L3Harris Technologies: In July 2023, L3Harris announced that it is expanding its partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries’ ELTA Systems Group (ELTA) to provide leading-edge, U.S. and NATO interoperable Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) solutions.The companies are offering a missionized Bombardier Global 6500, integrated by L3Harris, with ELTA’s latest next-generation AEW systems and operationally-proven Battle Management Command and Control Suite. The Global 6500 AEW&amp;C will fly higher, faster, longer and at a lower cost (to sustain, operate and maintain) than the existing AEW&amp;C platforms.LHX’s shares have risen 8.3% since Oct 6. Following the ongoing violence, we may expect further development in the aforementioned partnership to boost Israel’s airborne surveillance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Now, the order to unwind the deal “restores competition in the development of early cancer detection tests,” EU antitrust Commissioner Didier Reynders said.“By ordering Illumina to restore Grail’s independence, we ensure a level playing field in this crucial market to the ultimate benefit of European consumers,” he said.Illumina said it is reviewing the order to sell Grail. The company also has previously asked the EU’s highest court to rule on its challenge to the bloc's ability to review the merger.Allowing the deal to stand would have undermined the credibility of EU regulators. Companies almost invariably play by the rules and wait to complete an acquisition or merger until antitrust authorities have cleared it, according to the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer.Illumina announced the acquisition of Grail in 2020, but the commission said the company broke EU merger rules by completing the deal without its consent. The commission prohibited the deal in September 2022.The EU accused Illumina and Grail of knowingly and deliberately merging before getting clearance in what amounted to a vital infringement of the rules.Illumina must “restore the situation prevailing before” the acquisition, regulators said, and how Illumina divests itself of Grail also needs EU approval.Regulators worldwide have targeted the deal. The Federal Trade Commission ordered Illumina to sell Grail earlier this year after finding the merger would “stifle competition and innovation in the U.S. market for life-saving cancer tests.”The EU said the acquisition would squeeze out competitors and give Illumina too dominant of a position in the market.San Diego-based Illumina is a major supplier of next-generation sequencing systems for genetic and genomic analysis, while Grail is a health company developing blood tests to try to catch cancer early.]"

GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with SO.Insider Sell: Southern Nuclear CEO Stephen Kuczynski Sells 5,000 Shares of Southern Co (SO)Southern Co is a leading energy company serving 9 million customers through its subsidiaries. The company provides clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy through electric operating companies in three states, natural gas distribution companies in four states, a competitive generation company serving wholesale customers across America, and a nationally recognized provider of customized energy solutions, as well as fiber optics and wireless communications.The insider's recent sell-off has raised eyebrows among investors and analysts, as it comes at a time when Southern Co's stock is trading at $66 per share, giving the company a market cap of $73.19 billion. The stock's price-earnings ratio stands at 23.79, significantly higher than the industry median of 14.81 and the company's historical median price-earnings ratio.Insider Sell: Southern Nuclear CEO Stephen Kuczynski Sells 5,000 Shares of Southern Co (SO)Despite the insider's sell-off, Southern Co's stock appears to be modestly undervalued based on its GuruFocus Value of $75.22, with a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.88. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the companys past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.Over the past year, there have been no insider buys and 25 insider sells at Southern Co. This trend could indicate that insiders see the stock as overvalued, prompting them to sell their shares. However, investors should not solely rely on insider transactions when making investment decisions, as they are just one of many factors to consider.Story continuesIt's worth noting that the insider's sell-off does not necessarily indicate a negative outlook for the company. Insiders may sell shares for various reasons, including personal financial planning or diversification. Therefore, while the insider's recent sell-off is noteworthy, it should be considered within the broader context of Southern Co's overall financial performance and market conditions.As always, investors are advised to conduct their own thorough research before making any investment decisions.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, both CenterPoint Energy and Southern Co. are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CNP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 18.44, while SO has a forward P/E of 18.45. We also note that CNP has a PEG ratio of 2.45. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. SO currently has a PEG ratio of 4.61.Another notable valuation metric for CNP is its P/B ratio of 1.81. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SO has a P/B of 2.09.These metrics, and several others, help CNP earn a Value grade of B, while SO has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth CNP and SO are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CNP is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Cigna Group:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.078 = US$8.0b ÷ (US$150b - US$47b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Cigna Group has an ROCE of 7.8%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 9.7% average generated by the Healthcare industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cigna Group compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Cigna Group.So How Is Cigna Group's ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Cigna Group doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 7.8% from 10% five years ago. However it looks like Cigna Group might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOur Take On Cigna Group's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Cigna Group's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 45% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Cigna Group does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Cigna Group  that you might be interested in.While Cigna Group isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Alongside restocking a depleted C-suite, Wentworth will take on managing initiatives such as Walgreens’ move to open hundreds of doctors’ offices in its stores. The appointment will take effect Oct. 23, when Wentworth will also join the company’s board.Bloomberg first reported that Wentworth, 63, was in the running for the top job on Sept. 29 — news that was well-received by analysts and sent Walgreens shares up more than 6%. Wentworth now must get the chain back on track after falling behind rival CVS Health Corp. — whose bet on health care has largely paid off — and replace recently departed executives including former chief financial officer James Kehoe.Read More: Walgreens Is Still Paying for the Former CEO’s Retail StrategyThe hire is a solid first step in potentially returning the company to predictable growth, although it may take time, John Boylan, an analyst with Edward Jones, said Wednesday in an email. “This announcement may help raise investor sentiment for Walgreens shares, at least in the short term,” he said.The stock jumped as much as 7% at the New York market open. Walgreens is slated to report earnings Thursday.Story continuesBefore her abrupt departure at the end of August, Brewer, 61, had been working to broaden Walgreens’ offerings with moves like a $5.2 billion investment in primary-care provider VillageMD. Analysts have said the strategy was solid, yet investors were impatient.Walgreens had said it would seek a replacement for Brewer with “deep healthcare experience.” Wentworth graduated from Monroe Community College and Cornell University before rising to the top of some of the largest US health-care companies. He worked at PepsiCo Inc. and Mary Kay Inc. early in his career, and then held senior roles at pharmacy benefits manager Medco Health Solutions before mergers with Express Scripts and Cigna.Accelerate ProfitabilityIn an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News that discussed talking points about the appointment, Walgreens said Wentworth had been appointed because he is “widely recognized as a leading executive in the healthcare industry.”Wentworth will “accelerate the company’s path to profitability” and is acting “to ensure the healthcare segment is on track to achieve positive EBITDA” in the first half of 2024, according to the memo. “He believes that while WBA has made progress against several key initiatives, the company needs to do better.”The memo also said Wentworth would have to come off conflicting boards, but didn’t say which ones. Searches and appointments to replace Kehoe and former chief information officer Hsiao Wang, who left this month, would “resume expeditiously,” it added.Diversity IssuesThe talking points also attempted to address replacing a woman of color with a white man, and affirmed the company’s commitment to diversity. As the company’s first Black CEO, Brewer was a champion of diversity. She added other Black women to the upper ranks, including executive vice president and global chief legal officer Danielle Gray as well as Tracey Brown in the newly created role of chief customer officer.The memo outlined that Wentworth has spent “decades as a champion for underrepresented groups — especially women. He is also the father of three daughters.”Walgreens’ board retained an executive search firm to help identify potential candidates and that the board voted to confirm his appointment, according to the memo. Interim CEO Ginger Graham wasn’t considered for the permanent role, it said.Wentworth “is the right person to lead WBA’s next phase of growth into a customer-centric health-care company,” Stefano Pessina, Walgreens’ executive chairman and former CEO, said Wednesday in a statement.(Updates with analyst comment in fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaEurope at War Can’t Ignore Poland’s Bitter Election©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$35.65. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 116.50k shares for US$3.0m. On the other hand they divested 17.32k shares, for US$917k. In total, Zions Bancorporation National Association insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.

JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo all set to report before the bell Friday. Investors are going to be closely watching banks lending businesses, particularly. Activity has slowed in recent months thanks to tighter standards and reduced demand as a result of rapid interest rate hikes.In a note, Bank of America analysts predict JPM, JPMorgan, best positioned to handle the higher for longer environment while there's some skepticism around Wells Fargo. Also in focus, higher bond yields, which could be particularly problematic for banks with large volumes of securities on their books.With more on what to watch from banks this quarter, we've got Polo Rocha who is the reporter at American Banker. Great to have you here this morning with us. All right, so biggest winner that you're expecting to emerge from this bank portion of the earnings season.POLO ROCHA: You know, I think JPMorgan is right. I think it seems analysts think they're the best position to handle this higher for longer rate environment. I'd say, generally speaking though, the banking industry is going to report some profitability challenges. They're set to report that they made less money this last quarter than they did the quarter before, which is less than they made the quarter before. And these challenges, I think they're still making money but they're going to report less profits for the next couple of quarters, I think.Story continuesAnd so I think analysts are really kind of trying to figure out this quarter, when does that end? Kind of when does that pressure fade? And will there be some sort of catalyst for bank investors to jump back into the sector? Because they haven't really liked it so much this year.- Well, what do you expect to see on the deposit side of things? We obviously know this has been always a focal point when it comes to bank earnings. But even especially here within the last couple of quarters given the fallout that we saw in some of the regional banks and also this need for some of these banks to pay higher in order, pay more to those depositors, what are some of the trends that you'll be looking at this quarter?POLO ROCHA: So generally speaking, I think bank deposits are fairly stable. I think they might still be dropping here and there over the coming months as the Fed kind of continues to wind down its balance sheet. But really, the problem deposits-wise for banks is how much we're paying for those deposits. When interest rates were at basically zero, banks didn't really have to do that much. They didn't have to compensate their depositors all that much. That really has started changing last year and picked up even more so this year.There's money market funds that pay 5.5% to people and corporations that are just looking to park their cash somewhere. So banks are facing a little bit more competition. There's more competition among banks to pay more to depositors. That pressure is still continuing, it seems to be ebbing a bit. I think some of those pressures are accelerating a little bit less.But I think with interest rates potentially still rising but at the very least staying high for a while, that pressure won't really die down until maybe the Fed starts cutting rates. And that date seems to be getting pushed further and further ahead. So on the expense side of things, banks interest expenses are going to continue rising for quite a while.]"

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) + MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.1 BRAF V600E mutations can be assessed from either plasma or tumor tissue using the FoundationOne Liquid CDx or the FoundationOne CDx FDA-approved companion diagnostic tests, respectively.""Today’s approval builds on our long-standing commitment to deliver innovative, personalized medicines to patients with lung cancer. By pursuing precision medicines that target a patient’s specific type of cancer, we are leveraging our deep understanding of tumor biology to help address the underlying cause of disease,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President at Pfizer. ""Since its initial FDA approval in 2018, BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI combination therapy has helped thousands of people living with BRAF V600E- or V600K-mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma.2 We look forward to helping even more patients with our BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI targeted combination therapy.""The FDA’s approval is based on data from the ongoing Phase 2 PHAROS clinical trial (NCT03915951), an open-label, multicenter, single‑arm study examining BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI combination therapy in both treatment-naïve and previously treated patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic NSCLC.""BRAF V600E mutations identify a unique subtype of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that presents an actionable biomarker that precision medicines like BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI combination therapy can help address,"" said Gregory Riely, M.D., Ph.D., Vice Chair, Clinical Research in the Department of Medicine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and PHAROS investigator. ""The PHAROS trial demonstrated that these patients could benefit from BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI targeted therapy regardless of their prior treatment history. Given the specific efficacy and safety profile, patients and providers now have another option to help personalize treatment plans based on individual risk factors and preferences.""Story continuesThe PHAROS study met its major efficacy outcome measures of objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent review committee (IRC), and duration of response (DOR) in both treatment groups. For treatment-naïve patients (n=59), ORR was 75% (95% CI: 62, 85), and 59% of the patients responded for at least 12 months. Median DOR was not estimable (NE) for this group at the time of data cutoff. For previously treated patients (n=39), ORR was 46% (95% CI: 30, 63), and 33% of the patients responded for at least 12 months. Median DOR was 16.7 months (95% CI: 7.4, NE). These data were presented earlier this year at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO).3The most common (≥25%) all-causality adverse reactions observed in the PHAROS trial were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, visual impairment, constipation, dyspnea, rash, and cough. A total of 17% of patients experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of MEKTOVI and 16% experienced an adverse event that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥2% of patients included hemorrhage (6%), diarrhea (4.1%), anemia, dyspnea, pneumonia (3.1% each), arrhythmia, device-related infection, edema, myocardial infarction, and pleural effusion (2% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients, including intracranial hemorrhage and myocardial infarction (1% each).BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI is also FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. BRAFTOVI is FDA-approved, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.Pfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI in the U.S., Canada, and all countries in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights in Israel, and Pierre Fabre has exclusive rights in all other countries, including Europe and Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan and South Korea).The PHAROS trial is conducted with support from Pierre Fabre.About BRAF V600E-mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)Lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer and the number one cause of cancer-related death around the world.4 NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancers.5Certain lung cancers are linked to acquired genetic abnormalities like a BRAF V600E mutation. By using biomarkers to identify a person’s particular tumor type, treatment can become more personalized and effective, since the molecular makeup of a person’s cancer often determines how they respond to different therapies.A BRAF V600E mutation occurs in approximately 2% of NSCLC cases.6 It stimulates tumor cell growth and proliferation by altering the MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Targeting components of this pathway could potentially help inhibit tumor growth and proliferation caused by BRAF mutations.7Precision medicine is increasingly being developed for NSCLC patients with genetic changes, such as BRAF mutations, that can be detected using biomarker tests.8,9 In recent years, more widespread use of biomarker testing and targeted therapies have been associated with improvements in population-level NSCLC mortality.10INDICATIONS AND USAGEBRAFTOVI® (encorafenib) and MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) are kinase inhibitors indicated for use in combination for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.BRAFTOVI is indicated, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.BRAFTOVI and MEKTOVI are kinase inhibitors indicated for use in combination for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test.Limitations of Use: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma, wild-type BRAF CRC, or wild-type BRAF NSCLC.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONThis information applies to the safety of BRAFTOVI when used in combination with either MEKTOVI or cetuximab.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSNew Primary Malignancies: New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur. BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Perform dermatopathologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non- cutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment.BRAF-mutant type (BRAF-mt) metastatic melanoma (COLUMBUS study): Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 2.6% and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 1.6% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI with MEKTOVI. Median time to first occurrence of cuSCC/KA was 5.8 months.BRAF-mt metastatic CRC (BEACON CRC study): cuSCC, including KA, occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI with cetuximab.BRAF-mt metastatic NSCLC (PHAROS study): cuSCC and skin papilloma (SP), each occurred in 2% of patients.Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors: In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600E or V600K mutation using an FDA-approved test prior to initiating BRAFTOVI.Cardiomyopathy: Cardiomyopathy manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment.The safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN).BRAF-mt metastatic melanoma (COLUMBUS study): Evidence of cardiomyopathy occurred in 7% and Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI with MEKTOVI. The median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction (any grade) was 3.6 months. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of patients.BRAF-mt metastatic NSCLC (PHAROS study): Evidence of cardiomyopathy occurred in 11% and Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1% of patients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 82% of patients.Hepatotoxicity: Hepatotoxicity can occur. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.BRAF-mt metastatic melanoma (COLUMBUS study): The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving MEKTOVI with BRAFTOVI was 6% for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase.BRAF-mt metastatic NSCLC (PHAROS study): The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests was 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase.Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage can occur when BRAFTOVI is administered in combination with MEKTOVI or cetuximab. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.BRAF-mt metastatic melanoma (COLUMBUS study): Hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI with MEKTOVI and Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal hemorrhage (4.2%), hematochezia (3.1%), and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage (1%).

By Sept. 28, 2022, almost 7.6 million Americans had received the updated shots.U.S. public health officials have been optimistic that Americans will get the new vaccines and have recommended that everyone ages 6 months and older receive one.But demand has dropped sharply since 2021, when the shots were first introduced at the height of the pandemic.About 17% of the U.S. population, or 56.5 million people, ultimately received last year's version of the vaccines.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and AstraZeneca PLC (AZN). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UnitedHealth shares have modestly outperformed the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+4.3% vs. +3.9%), but have lagged the broader market (+4.3% vs. +22.2%). The company’s top line remains well-poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.UnitedHealth’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. The Government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividends.However, membership in its global business continues to decline. High operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Chevron have gained +9.5% over the past year against the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry’s gain of +20.0%. The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we saw CVX’s EPS jump 132% in 2022. However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially.The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AstraZeneca shares have gained +26.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +28.7%. The company enjoys a diverse product portfolio and a global footprint. AstraZeneca’s key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Fasenra and Farxiga should keep driving revenues. Almost all non-COVID therapy areas of AstraZeneca demonstrated double-digit revenue growth in the first half of 2023.AstraZeneca’s pipeline is strong with important phase III data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets. The Alexion buyout has added drugs like Ultomiris that are boosting its top line.However, AstraZeneca’s diabetes franchise faces stiff competition while pricing pressure hurts sales in the respiratory unit. Sales have slowed down in its key market, China.(You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Adobe Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Bristol Myers Squibb BMY, Mirati Therapeutics MRTX, Eli Lilly LLY, POINT Biopharma PNT and Pfizer PFE.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:Cancer Biotecha Pique Buyout Interest: Recent Deals in FocusMergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) in pharma and biotech are back in focus after two important deals were announced in a fortnight.Bristol Myers Squibb announced that it will acquire commercial-stage oncology company Mirati Therapeutics for a total equity value of $4.8 billion-plus contingent value right of approximately $1.0 billion. The acquisition will add Mirati's new lung cancer drug Krazati (adagrasib) to BMY's strong oncology portfolio. The drug was approved by the FDA in December 2022 for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.Bristol Myers will also get access to Mirati's early-stage candidate MRTX1719, a potential first-in-class MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor. It is currently in phase I development and has shown encouraging early efficacy data across several tumor types. Mirati had long been a buyout target.Last week, Eli Lilly offered to buy POINT Biopharma, a maker of next-generation radioligand therapies for treating cancers, for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. Radioligand therapy is a type of precision cancer treatment, which combines a targeting compound (ligand) with a therapeutic radioisotope (a radioactive particle).Point Biopharma's lead pipeline candidate is PNT2002, which is being developed to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after progression on hormonal treatment. The phase III SPLASH study on PNT2002 is complete and top-line data is expected in the fourth quarter of 2023. The acquisition of POINT Biopharma, if successfully closed, will bolster Lilly's portfolio of cancer drugs.Story continuesThere have been quite a few M&amp;A deals in the pharma and biotech sector so far this year.M&amp;A deals in the pharma and biotech sector have been quite active this year so far.The first half of 2023 saw some mega-merger announcements. Pfizer offered to buy cancer drugmaker Seagen for $43 billion in March. The acquisition is expected to be closed in late 2023 or early 2024. Merck closed the acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences (announced in April) for approximately $10.8 billion in June. Amgen's $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics closed last week after the companies resolved the pending Federal Trade Commission administrative lawsuit.Generally, the drug and biotech sector is characterized by aggressive M&amp;A activity. Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies, sitting on huge piles of cash, regularly buy innovative small/mid-cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. Fast-growing and lucrative markets such as oncology, rare disease and cell and gene therapy are mostly the focus areas for M&amp;A activities.However, the M&amp;A deals of 2023, Bristol-Myers/Mirati, Lilly/ POINT Biopharma and Pfizer/Seagen, show that there is an increasing interest of drugmakers in companies making innovative cancer treatments. In an evolving global oncology landscape, emerging biotechs making cancer drugs with novel mechanisms of action and providing better outcomes than currently available drugs are attracting buyout interest. The market for cancer medicines is expected to continue to increase as disease rates rise in leaps and bounds globally. Consequently, biotechs focused on cancer medicines are likely to see an increase in buyout interest.Bristol-Myers and Eli Lilly have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.

I love it. You know, I think we could add to it what we’ve added to all of our sports.”Emanuel spoke Wednesday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles. The event covers the collision of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. It features leaders in media, sports and technology. Thursday’s lineup of speakers includes Netflix Inc. co-CEO Ted Sarandos, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, tennis great Maria Sharapova and reality TV star Kris Jenner.Considered one of the top talent agents in Hollywood, Emanuel co-founded the Endeavor agency in 1995, merging it later with one of the oldest names in the business, William Morris.Endeavor has since expanded into events and sports ownership, acquiring the mixed martial arts league Ultimate Fighting Championship in a 2016 deal valued at $4 billion. Last month, Emanuel completed a merger of that business with World Wrestling Entertainment, creating a giant in the world of combat sports called TKO Group Holdings Inc.Story continuesEmanuel called for striking screen actors and Hollywood studios to come to the table to end the three-month long dispute that’s put the film and TV industry on hold.“I don’t think they want us agents involved,” said Emanuel, who added his company recently signed deals for Tyler Perry and producer David Ellison at Netflix. “When you’re in negotiation, get half the loaf and move along.”Donna Langley, chief content officer for TV and film giant NBCUniversal, also spoke at the Screentime event, expressing her concern that without a settlement to Hollywood’s labor troubles, next year’s film lineup will suffer.“One of the reasons why I’m so focused on bringing a resolution to the strike is not being able to finish the films that are being shut down,” she said. “If I learned anything during Covid, the lack of volume really impacts the movie-going cadence.”Langley, who participated in contract talks with striking screenwriters, said concerns about artificial intelligence taking jobs are premature.“We are big believers in the fact that creativity comes from a human being,” she said. “In the production universe, there are things that AI will enable. Other things to look at are marketing, efficiencies, things that have nothing to do with performance.”Emanuel said he was impressed by the turnaround being led by Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. CEO David Zaslav, and that Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger would also be successful. He was critical of Paramount Global, the Redstone-family controlled parent of CBS, MTV and other channels.“I think Zas has figured it out,” Emanuel said. “He went through that tough year where he was getting killed. Bob’s going through it now. He’s a very good executive. He’ll figure it out. I would not put my money on Paramount.”He also questioned the outlook for Fox Corp., controlled by the Murdochs. “I think there’s gonna be rough times at Fox,” he said. “Just because the demographic is getting older and you know, you’ve got family issues.”Emanuel had strong words for rival Creative Artists Agency, which has been sued by a former client who said the company didn’t do enough to stop producer Harvey Weinstein and his sexual harassment. Emanuel said leadership at CAA, Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane, needed to step aside and permit a thorough outside investigation. CAA has called the claims “completely without merit.”(Updates with comments on CAA, actors’ strike and media giants.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSRural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL. Click here to check it out. PYPL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PYPLAs of 2023-10-11, PayPal Holdings Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $111.56. It's currently trading at a price of $57.72. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 48.26%. The company is significantly undervalued.The Art of Valuation: Discovering PayPal Holdings Inc's Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. PayPal Holdings Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$3.57GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.55%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 20.60% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=57.95Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=58.2Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=111.56Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $85.08. This valuation indicates that the PayPal Holdings Inc is significantly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 32.16%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

A new strike is on the horizon, this one at defense contractor General Dynamics. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramnian is here with the details. Pras?Hey Josh. As this big three UAW strike enters the 27th day, we saw earlier this week that the UAW members at Mack Trucks rejected a tentative deal and went on strike on Monday. Now just a couple of days later, we hear about last night General Dynamics the defense contractor saying that its members voted to authorize the strike by a 97% vote to potentially go on strike if their deal with the General Dynamics does expires on the 22nd of October.So they've authorized that strike. You know I wonder if the moves by the UAW members of big 3 has sort of emboldened these workers. We'll see but potentially another UAW chapter here going on strike with the defense contractor. But also, I want to note that GM's kind of a reprieve for GM at least them in Canada.Unifor members there, the Canadian Auto Workers Union, they actually struck a deal their tentative deal with GM to increase base pay, increase Cola adjustments and things like that. So reprieve there for GM as the sort of big three strikes happen in the US.- You know, Pras, while all this is going on strike-wise, we got another interesting announcement. Samsung SDI and Stellantis are creating a new, planning a new EV battery plant in Indiana while all this is happening. So tell us about that and what we make of it.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMNIAN: Yeah it is just a lot going on right now in the world of the UAW, and the big 3, and all these other plants that are associated with the UAW. But yes, a couple of days ago, Julie, it was Sean Fein sort of pulled back on any possible strikes on Friday saying that they had reached an agreement with GM potentially where GM would said they will include the joint venture battery plants with their master agreement, meaning that UAW members could unionize at these plants.That's sort of a big deal because it was a sticking point, and maybe Ford and GM have to, sorry, Ford and Stellantis may have to follow suit. And just now this morning, we hear Stellantis going to put in a new second battery plant at the Kokomo, Indiana facility. The two battery plants there, about $3.2 billion in investment, 1,400 workers.But yes, you know that Sean Fein will be eyeing this deal. Maybe he might mention it on Friday when he does this other update potentially saying, hey, we're watching you guys with these battery plants. We saw GM has agreed to potentially add these battery plants to the mass agreement. Will Stellantis follow suit? We'll see. Maybe they might actually put the hurt on them potentially with more stand strikes.]"

Meanwhile, GM in Canada gets a reprieve from Unifor members. And on the Stellantis (STLA) front: the company said it will expand its battery production plans in the US — a key point of issue as UAW contract talks continue.As the current UAW strike against the Big Three (GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis) enters a 27th day, more UAW members at other companies have been pushing for better terms. UAW members at Mack Trucks rejected a deal and went on strike just this week, and late Tuesday night UAW members at defense contractor General Dynamics voted to authorize a strike in case a new deal isn’t reached.In a letter posted by UAW president Shawn Fain to General Dynamics union members, Fain said 97% of members voted to authorize a strike in case a new deal isn’t reached by the contract expiration deadline of 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday, Oct. 22.General Dynamics employs around 1,100 UAW members at plants located in Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. If these workers eventually go on strike, they will join the approximately 4,400 Mack Trucks workers striking currently who are not part of the UAW’s Big Three stand up strikes. UAW actions against the Big Three involve around 25,000 striking auto workers at the moment.Now GM has been given something of a reprieve, however, across the border. Canada’s Unifor auto union, after going on strike for about half a day, reached a tentative deal with GM.GM's Oshawa assembly complex where 4,300 unionized workers went on strike at three General Motors plants, including Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. (Arlyn McAdorey/REUTERS) (Arlyn McAdorey / reuters)GM agreed to terms similar to those Ford reached with Unifor, with the union using the Ford deal as a “pattern agreement” for negotiations. If the deal is voted through, Unifor’s 4,300 GM workers will get 20% base hikes in pay, reactivation of COLA benefits next year, wage progression reduced by half to four years, conversion of some temps to full time, and other concessions.Is that progress? Maybe.Story continuesLast week, UAW president Fain did not expand strikes against the Big Three. He said a major concession was made by GM: The automaker supposedly said it would allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to unionize. This was a major move as it would likely mean Ford and Stellantis would have to agree to similar terms in the collective bargaining process as the entire industry transforms itself from gas-powered cars to electrified vehicles.Battery plant expansion is a worry for the UAW. (Carlos Osorio/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)And only a few days later on Wednesday morning, Stellantis announced that it and battery partner Samsung SDI will invest over $3.2 billon to “co-locate” a new battery plant in Kokomo, Ind., alongside another gigafactory currently under construction.Stellantis said this second “StarPlus” gigafactory will start producing batteries in 2027, and employ 1,400 workers; the first StarPlus gigafactory in Kokomo is expected to start production in Q1 of 2025.This announcement will certainly not go unnoticed at UAW’s “Solidarity House” headquarters in Detroit, where Fain and his executive committee see new battery and joint-venture gigafactories as an existential threat to the union — if workers at those new plants can’t unionize, of course.Next from Fain? Expect another UAW stand up strike update this Friday. He'll more likely than not put the spotlight on Stellantis’s latest battery plant move.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The UAW achieved a major breakthrough in negotiations when General Motors allowed its workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts, but the unprecedented strike is still ongoing. Meanwhile, even the EV king Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) is facing challenges.The UAW Is Making ProgressAs for wages, Ford offered a 23% hike followed by Stellantis who offered 20% and GM who offered about a 20% increase. All three automakers agreed to cut timeline to get to top wage rate from eight to three years. As for temporary workers, Ford raised the hourly wage to $21, while GM and Stellantis followed by $20. Ford and Stellantis agreed to reinstate the cost of living allowance and UAW President Shawn Fain stated that GM is not far behind. Neither of the three automakers agreed to restore pre-2007 defined benefit pension plans. As for plant closures, Ford agreed that the UAW has the right to strike over plant shutdowns with workers getting income protection, while Stellantis only agreed to the workers’ rights to strike over plant shutdowns. No agreement on the issue has been made with GM who is the only automaker to allow workers at joint-venture battery plants to be covered by union contracts.GM Took Another HitOn Tuesday, 4,300 workers at three of its facilities in Canada went on strike but the two sides reached a tentative agreement within a few hours.AutoTrader executive editor and spokesperson Brian Moody finds General Motors to be the most vulnerable of the Detroit titans in these ongoing negotiations with the continuing strike having consequences for both the new and used automotive market.Consequences Of The StrikeAbout 4,835 workers have been laid off since the UAW strike took off on September 15th. More precisely, GM furloughed 2,330 workers, Ford followed by 1,865 layoffs, followed by Stellantis who let go 640 workers. GM , Ford nor Stellantis have disclosed if they will be rehiring those workers once the strike comes to an end. According to Anderson Economic Group, three weeks of the ongoing strikes costed the U.S. economy $5.5 billion, with the three Detroit automakers losing $2.68 billion and part suppliers losing another $1.6 billion.Story continuesTesla Is Also Facing Challenges Of Its OwnIn September, Tesla experienced a 10.9% YoY volume drop in China-made EV sales as it sold 74,073 EVs that it built in China with Model 3 and Model Y specifically falling 12% compared to the previous month. On October 2nd, it already missed third quarter estimates for global deliveries due to planned factory upgrades that halted production.Meanwhile, its biggest rival in China, BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) experienced a 42.8% growth in passenger vehicle deliveries that reached 286,903 vehicles. With the stabilisation of the economy, tax incentives and discounts it is offerings, Tesla is waiting for a revival of the consumer sentiment. But, it is also facing a probe by the European Commission who is investigating whether to set punitive tariffs to protect its producers from imports of cheaper Chinese-made EVs. The European Commission found that made-in-China EVs are typically one fifth cheaper than their made-in-the-EU counterparts due to tax breaks, subsidies and rebates. Tesla is the biggest exporter of China-made-EVs with its Shanghai plant making more than 700,000 vehicles last years which made half of its total output.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Click here to watch more of Yahoo Finance's special coverage ""EVs: The Road Ahead.""For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video Transcript[MUSIC PLAYING]AKIKO FUJITA: Full time now to talk about EVs and the road ahead. For those in the market for a new car, how many are on the market for an electric vehicle? Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian hopefully has the answer for us with the results of our new poll. Pras, we're talking about EVs already making up roughly 8% of the overall US market. How much more can it expand given the current terms?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, according to our new poll done with Yahoo Finance and Ipsos, I don't know how much more it can go beyond that as at least as of right now. We pulled over thousand people here from-- at the end of September and beginning of October, and it found that 57% of respondents said they were not likely to purchase an EV, whether it was a new EV or new to them. Only 31% said they were likely to purchase an EV.Now, EV is defined as a plug-in electric or a fully electric car. You know, I've been tracking these polls for some time now. And usually, it's around 50%. So to see that slight downtick to 57% or more negativity is sort of new here. You know, drilling down deeper, we're seeing some of the same concerns that we've heard about before. 70% are worried about overall cost, 73% are concerned about driving range, and 77% noted a lack of charging stations or perceived lack of charging stations.Story continuesSo you know, Americans-- and also I want to mention Americans aren't happy about mandates to kill gas powered cars. 61% of people oppose those restrictions. There is a silver lining, though, for governments and people that want to see the EV expansion here in the country continue.Basically, only 20% are aware of recent price cuts of EVs, like for instance, Ford cars and Tesla EVs, and only-- in the same amount, 20% are aware of charging deal expansions, right? So Tesla's expansion of its supercharger network to other automakers. They're not aware of that, but that's happening. So education is key here if the country is going to see, the Biden administration's 50% mandate of EVs by 2030.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, especially if the concern is cost. Educating consumers on the fact that there's a generous $7,500 incentive there at least for new EVs. What did you find in terms of brands that prospective buyers are looking at right now? You know, Tesla has been leading the way. What are some others that have gained?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So yeah, we asked about what brand people would consider if they were to buy an electric vehicle in the future and it's our next car. And I was surprised to see that Toyota tops the list at 30%. That's a big number here. And if you think about it, Toyota only really has the bZ4X, which just came out. It's in limited capacity there. But they do have the Prius. So that's sort of maybe why they're top of mind amongst consumers.Tesla was next at 23%. So a little bit behind Toyota. And you know, Tesla is the biggest player in the market right now. Honda at 20%. They don't even have any EVs out yet, right? So GM at 15%. That's going to be ramping up second half of the year. And Ford, of course, has had EVs on the market for a couple of years now. So for their rounding out the top five of the marks that we've seen.I also want to quickly note that Mercedes and BMW in the luxury premium segment, they sort of popped up in our survey too. But we didn't actually pose a question as to what premium or luxury EV makers you would actually consider purchasing for your next EV.]"

Many auto biggies, including General Motors GM, Honda HMC, Toyota TM, Nissan and Volvo, among others registered double-digit percentage sales growth year over year, thanks to pent-up demand as the industry continues to rebound from the pandemic and chip crunch.Per Automotive News, U.S. light vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023 topped 3.8 million units, up 17% year over year. The seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate for September 2023 was 15.2-15.5 million vehicles, up from 13.7 million vehicles a year earlier, per GlobalData.Q3 U.S. Sales Figures of Major AutomakersGeneral Motors’ third-quarter sales in the United States rose 21% year over year to 674,336 units. Volumes at key brands namely Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC increased 21%, 6%, 54% and 19%, respectively. GM’s closest peer Ford F saw its sales increase 7.7% to 500,504 units. Sales of the Ford brand rose 8%, while that of Lincoln increased 1.8%. The third quarter of 2023 marked record electric vehicle sales for Ford on the soaring popularity of Mustang Mach-E and E Transit.Ford currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stellantis STLA, however, saw a 1% decrease in third-quarter volume with 380,563 units sold. While sales of Jeep, RAM, Dodge, Fiat and Alpha Romeo brands declined 4%, 4%, 23%, 30% and 16%, respectively, Chrysler sales rocketed 96% year over year.Japan’s auto giant Toyota experienced a 12.2% year-over-year increase in U.S. sales in the September quarter, reaching a total of 590,296 vehicles. The namesake brand witnessed a 12.4% rise, while Lexus saw 10.9% growth in sales. TM’s closest peer, Honda’s total sales saw a significant surge of 40.6%, with a total of 339,143 units sold. Both the Honda and Acura brands experienced impressive year-over-year growth, with sales rising 38.3% and 69.3%, respectively.Story continuesSales of Subaru increased 18.8%, while that of Mazda and Nissan jumped around 22% and 40%, respectively. Volkswagen and BMW’s sales were up 6.5% and 7.8% respectively. Sales of Hyundai and Kia increased 10.2% and 13.8%, respectively.  Sales of Kia grew 23.4% year over year for the month.Inventory PositionAt the beginning of September, U.S. inventories amounted to 2.2 million vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 813,000 cars and light trucks compared to September 2022, according to Cox Automotive.Despite a UAW strike against Detroit’s three automakers (which began on Sep 15) and robust sales, the total inventory reached 2.21 million units as of Oct 2, 2023. This marks a 60% increase from the year-ago levels and the highest new-vehicle inventory since early 2021. However, it is still 35% lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.Inventory remains relatively stable overall. Most Detroit automakers, except for certain GM models, have sufficient inventory to support operations for about a month. Some brands are experiencing inventory build-up, which will take time to affect the distribution network. However, prolonged strike action could have more pronounced effects in the coming weeks.General Motors reported its highest inventory of new vehicles on dealer lots since 2020 at the end of the third quarter. However, GM's Chevrolet and Cadillac brands have the lowest inventory among the Detroit automakers, making them more vulnerable to a protracted strike, with supply levels below the industry average. Chevrolet is at 57 days' supply, and Cadillac is at 46. They were already below average before the strike. Interestingly, Chevrolet and Cadillac models, with the tightest supply, are often the most popular ones and the biggest profit generators for GM. Its other brands, such as Buick and GMC, have higher stock levels.Stellantis is in a better position, with ample supply across its four volume brands. Dodge and Chrysler have the highest days' supply among all brands, at 142 and 127, respectively. Ram and Jeep, too, have a high supply. The strike has had a minor impact on Jeep models produced at the Toledo, OH plant, with the Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator having 77- and 116-day supply, respectively.Ford's inventory varies among its brands and models. Lincoln has the highest days' supply among luxury brands at 124. Ford brand is at 88 days' supply, with the F-150 at 97 days' supply at the start of October. However, strikes have affected models like the Explorer, Bronco, and Ranger. Besides a few disruptions, Ford maintains ample stock for other models, including the Escape and Bronco Sport.Incentives &amp; Average Transaction PricesThe generous incentives offered by automakers played a crucial role in boosting retail deliveries in the third quarter of 2023, offsetting the impact of high interest rates. In September, the average new vehicle incentive was projected to rise to $1,806 from $999 in September 2022, with truck and SUV incentives at $1,921 (up $889) and car incentives at $1,340 (up $470), per J.D. Power-GlobalData.The average cost of a new vehicle in the United States is high, around $47,000. Despite the Federal Reserve pausing its rate hikes in August and September, average interest rates for new-vehicle loans are now around 9%, marking their highest point in 23 years, according to Cox Automotive.Moody's Analytics estimates that the average American household now needs 42 weeks of income to afford a new light vehicle, a significant increase from 33 weeks required just three years ago.Jonathan Smoke, the chief economist at Cox Automotive, foresees demand for new vehicles to be constrained by the combination of elevated pricing and high interest rates.Final ThoughtsThe outlook for fourth-quarter U.S. auto sales is dependent on the evolving dynamics of the UAW strike against the Detroit 3 automakers — F, GM and STLA — and its duration. Thus far, the strike has had a relatively minimal impact on dealer inventory, sales, or pricing. However, the situation could change in the coming weeks and months if the strike persists. A prolonged strike would likely result in reduced new-car inventory for the affected brands and potentially higher transaction prices, particularly if demand surpasses supply.Despite the U.S. auto industry's steady progress in boosting production and new vehicle inventory throughout the year, the strike could undo these gains. Although high interest rates are yet to deter consumer demand for vehicles, affordability concerns could eventually impede further growth. There's a palpable unease that the recovery momentum may stall once pent-up demand is adequately met.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

See our latest analysis for United Airlines Holdings Is United Airlines Holdings Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$2.56bUS$651.0mUS$1.96bUS$1.76bUS$1.64bUS$1.58bUS$1.54bUS$1.53bUS$1.53bUS$1.54bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -6.53%Est @ -3.93%Est @ -2.10%Est @ -0.83%Est @ 0.07%Est @ 0.69% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 12% -US$2.3kUS$519US$1.4kUS$1.1kUS$929US$797US$697US$617US$551US$495(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.8bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 12%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (12%– 2.2%) = US$16bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$16b÷ ( 1 + 12%)10= US$5.1bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$9.9b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$40.4, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at United Airlines Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.976. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for United Airlines HoldingsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for UAL.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

Its revenues and earnings are likely to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results primarily benefited from a rise in the assets under management (AUM) balance, driven by decent inflows. However, a tough operating environment hurt performance fees, which led to a fall in segment revenues.Blackstone has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 5.7%.Blackstone Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Blackstone Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBlackstone Inc. price-eps-surprise | Blackstone Inc. QuoteThe business prospects and activities of the company in the third quarter did not win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter earnings of 97 cents per share has been revised 2% lower over the past seven days. The figure indicates a decline of 8.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for earnings is pinned at 94 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $2.49 billion, which suggests a fall of 4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric is $2.48 billion.Now, let’s check the factors that are expected to have influenced the company’s third-quarter performance.Key Factors and Estimates for Q3Blackstone has been witnessing increases in fee-earning AUM and total AUM for the past few years on the back of its diversified product and revenue mix, a superior position in the alternative investments space, and net inflows.Despite subdued market volatility and lower client activity in the third quarter because of seasonality, and concerns over the economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy and other geopolitical issues, Blackstone is expected to have recorded growth in the AUM balance in the quarter, driven by overall asset inflows.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Blackstone’s third-quarter AUM is pegged at $1.03 trillion, which indicates a rise of 7.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total AUM is pinned at $1 trillion. The consensus estimate for total fee-earning AUM of $745 billion suggests a year-over-year rise of 5.5%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $736.5 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net management and advisory fees (segment revenues) for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.66 billion, which indicates a rise of 2.7% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same is $1.49 billion.The consensus estimate for fee-related performance revenues (segment revenues) of $299 million suggests a decline of 19.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the metric is pinned at $160.2 million.Blackstone’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years mainly because of higher general, administrative and other expenses. As the company has been continuing to make investments in franchise, expenses are expected to have risen to some extent in the third quarter. Our estimate for total expenses (GAAP basis) is pinned at $1.58 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 64.8%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, the chances of Blackstone beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Blackstone is -0.10%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Story continuesStocks That Warrant a LookA couple of finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +2.11% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

248,790428fb-f039-3ef9-be67-df8c7868e0c7,PNC,2023-10-12,Earnings Preview: State Street Corporation (STT) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-state-street-corporation-140028372.html,1697032828,STORY,"['STT', 'PNC']","[State Street Corporation (STT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.68 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.7%.Revenues are expected to be $2.92 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10.26% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for State Street Corporation?For State Street Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that State Street Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that State Street Corporation would post earnings of $2.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.17, delivering a surprise of +4.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.State Street Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) is soon expected to post earnings of $3.18 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -15.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $5.32 billion, down 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc has been revised 0.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.26%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Leerink upgraded Amgen (AMGN) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $318, up from $267, noting that the rating change is both a multiple-expansion and earnings-upside call.Raymond James upgraded Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $170 price target. Following a ""relatively slower period"" in front-line releases, the firm sees a number of reasons to become incrementally more optimistic in the company's near- and medium-term path forward.BofA upgraded PNC Financial (PNC) to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $121 as part of a broader research note on U.S. Banks. The company's relative capital positioning is a significant positive, which should allow PNC to capture market share opportunities, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Signature's loan portfolio, the firm says.Goldman Sachs upgraded Shoals Technologies (SHLS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $28, up from $27, implying 85% upside from current levels. The firm is ""tactically more bullish,"" saying the overhang from recent warranty expense issues appear to be priced into the shares.B.

The firm sees sustained margin pressure as the company invests in capacity.Piper Sandler downgraded Arista Networks (ANET) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $190. The firm has concerns around 2024 networking spend and says Arista's valuation is reflecting a more balanced risk/reward profile at these levels.Raymond James downgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $520, down from $600. The firm believes the stock's significant outperformance year-to-date sets up a more balanced risk/reward scenario relative to historical levels.BofA downgraded Timken (TKR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $74, down from $100, as the firm sees a ""no pain, no gain"" theme as it looks towards 2024 in its Machinery, E&amp;C and Waste coverage.JPMorgan downgraded RXO Inc.

ROST.Industry: Retail - Discount StoresLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2163365/4-stocks-from-the-buoyant-retail-discount-store-spaceThe outlook for the Retail – Discount Stores industry remains optimistic, driven by a combination of consumer trends, technological innovations and strategic adaptations. With consumers becoming increasingly value-conscious, discount retailers are well-positioned to cater to this demand. The industry's resilience, especially during economic uncertainties, is bolstered by the sector's ability to offer cost-effective products.Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows retailers to optimize their operations, personalize customer experiences and enhance overall efficiency, ensuring a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corp., The TJX Companies, Inc., Target Corp. and Ross Stores, Inc. have been deepening engagements with consumers and adding more compelling products.About the IndustryThe Retail - Discount Stores industry is a significant segment within the retail sector that caters to price-conscious consumers seeking value-for-money products. These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing, and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing.These stores often carry both national and private-label brands, providing a mix of products to cater to a diverse customer base. The Retail - Discount Stores industry has shown resilience even during economic downturns, as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.Story continues4 Key Industry Trends to WatchConsumers' Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers' purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. August marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending.With the holiday season approaching, retailers are all gearing up to walk the extra mile to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

This article will delve into a comprehensive valuation analysis to provide an answer. Let's explore.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ISRG. Click here to check it out. ISRG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ISRGIntuitive Surgical Inc is a pioneer in the development, production, and marketing of a robotic system designed to assist minimally invasive surgery. The company's innovative approach also extends to providing instrumentation, disposable accessories, and warranty services for the system. With over 8,000 da Vinci systems placed in hospitals worldwide, including nearly 5,000 installations in the U.S. and a growing number in emerging markets, Intuitive Surgical's influence is palpable.At present, the company's stock price stands at $284.79, while the GF Value, an estimation of its fair value, is $364.62. This discrepancy suggests that the stock might be modestly undervalued.Unveiling Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally trade.If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher. Currently, Intuitive Surgical's market cap is $100.10 billion, and based on our GF Value, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued.Story continuesGiven this undervaluation, the long-term return of Intuitive Surgical's stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Unveiling Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company's stock, it's crucial to assess its financial strength. Investing in companies with poor financial strength poses a higher risk of permanent loss. Key indicators of financial strength include the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Intuitive Surgical boasts a cash-to-debt ratio of 10,000, ranking better than 99.64% of 833 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. Overall, the company's financial strength is strong, scoring 10 out of 10.Unveiling Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially those that have consistently demonstrated profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins typically offers better performance potential than one with low profit margins. Intuitive Surgical has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $6.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.99. Its operating margin of 24.34% is better than 88.19% of 830 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Intuitive Surgical's profitability as strong.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Intuitive Surgical is 11.2%, ranking better than 60.66% of 727 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 6.8%, ranking worse than 54.25% of 730 companies in the same industry.Another method of determining a company's profitability is to compare its return on invested capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Intuitive Surgical's ROIC is 16.91, and its WACC is 14.48.Unveiling Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionOverall, the stock of Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is believed to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is strong, and its profitability is robust. However, its growth ranks worse than 54.25% of 730 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry.

This massive expenditure showcases a sector that is significantly impacting economic narratives, offering investors stability in uncertain times.Moreover, anticipating that one in five Americans will be sixty-five or older by 2030, the healthcare sector emerges as a strategic investment.

Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $135 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for SBA Communications shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, SBA Communications is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry that ranks in the Bottom 31% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.21 per share to $3.22 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about SBA Communications right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

This makes the dividend yield 2.7%, which is above the industry average. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. Based on the last payment, Lockheed Martin was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 5.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 45%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendLockheed Martin Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $4.60 total annually to $12.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Lockheed Martin has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 27% per annum. The company doesn't have any problems growing, despite returning a lot of capital to shareholders, which is a very nice combination for a dividend stock to have.Lockheed Martin Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Lockheed Martin is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: Leerink upgraded Amgen (AMGN) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $318, up from $267, noting that the rating change is both a multiple-expansion and earnings-upside call.Raymond James upgraded Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $170 price target. Following a ""relatively slower period"" in front-line releases, the firm sees a number of reasons to become incrementally more optimistic in the company's near- and medium-term path forward.BofA upgraded PNC Financial (PNC) to Neutral from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $121 as part of a broader research note on U.S. Banks. The company's relative capital positioning is a significant positive, which should allow PNC to capture market share opportunities, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Signature's loan portfolio, the firm says.Goldman Sachs upgraded Shoals Technologies (SHLS) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $28, up from $27, implying 85% upside from current levels. The firm is ""tactically more bullish,"" saying the overhang from recent warranty expense issues appear to be priced into the shares.B. Riley upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $51, up from $37.

The firm sees sustained margin pressure as the company invests in capacity.Piper Sandler downgraded Arista Networks (ANET) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged price target of $190. The firm has concerns around 2024 networking spend and says Arista's valuation is reflecting a more balanced risk/reward profile at these levels.Raymond James downgraded HubSpot (HUBS) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $520, down from $600. The firm believes the stock's significant outperformance year-to-date sets up a more balanced risk/reward scenario relative to historical levels.BofA downgraded Timken (TKR) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $74, down from $100, as the firm sees a ""no pain, no gain"" theme as it looks towards 2024 in its Machinery, E&amp;C and Waste coverage.JPMorgan downgraded RXO Inc. (RXO) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $16, down from $17.

The firm sees a balanced risk/reward profile, citing the company's ""still-declining"" crypto trading volume and uncertainty around the return of the ""retail stock trader"" on monthly active users.UBS initiated coverage of Lockheed Martin (LMT) with a Neutral rating and $470 price target. The firm sees low-single digit budget growth, with the 25% trailing two-year investment increase yet to flow through to revenue.BofA resumed coverage of Amgen with a Neutral rating and $290 price target after the Horizon Therapeutics deal closed following ""almost a year of tortuous FTC review.""BofA reinstated coverage of Unilever (UL) with an Underperform rating and $44 price target.

265,425fd71f-eb9a-3165-a91f-57306f542cf2,MAR,2023-10-12,U.S. Defense Stocks to Gain as Israel-Hamas Conflict Escalates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-defense-stocks-gain-israel-130500805.html,1697029500,STORY,"['RTX', 'BA', 'LHX', 'LMT']","[Fresh tensions have once again erupted in the Middle East, owing to the ongoing violence between Palestine’s Hamas group and Israeli militants that took thousands of lives over the past couple of days. The conflict started with Hamas launching sudden missile attacks on the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, to which Israel’s military responded with multiple airstrikes on Gaza strip.This unprecedented assault by Hamas and the retaliatory strikes from Israel are poised to be beneficial for U.S. defense stocks, especially those that are notable weapons suppliers to Israel. Evidently, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense Index surged a solid 6.7%, following the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict. This, in turn, puts the spotlight on major weapon manufacturers like Lockheed Martin LMT, RTX Corp. RTX, Boeing BA and L3Harris Technologies LHX.U.S. Support to IsraelAmerica has been a patronizer for Israel, aiding in promoting the country’s economic prosperity and regional security for many years. To this end, it is imperative to mention that the United States signed a landmark agreement with Israel in 2016. Per the contract, the United States pledged to offer military aid worth $38 billion to Israel over a period of 10 years.Israel has to spend $1.2 billion per year on the advanced military equipment that only the United States can provide. Obviously, this enhanced the inflow of U.S.-made weapons in Israel, thereby bolstering the U.S. defense majors’ profits from international markets.In view of the recent scenario, U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to provide additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors, to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and citizens, as stated in a CNBC report. Notably, the first plane carrying U.S. ammunition and military supplies has already landed at an air base in Southern Israel.Moreover, considering the fact that there are quite a few U.S. citizens among the hostages that Hamas has taken over the past couple of days, America has also enhanced its military force in the region to strengthen deterrence.Story continuesU.S. Defense Stocks to GainConsidering the current military instability in Southern Israel, there’s a high possibility of witnessing further hostility among the two parties. This, in turn, offers more growth opportunities for the following defense stocks.Lockheed Martin: LMT offers its C-130 and F-16 aircraft to Israel that the Israel Air Force has been using since the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Israel is the owner of the largest fleet of F-16 fighters outside the United States.In light of the current situation, LMT’s shares have risen 8.6% since Oct 6, following Hamas’ latest strike on Israel. To tackle the ongoing violence in Southern Israel, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin recently ordered more of Lockheed-built F-35 and F-16 fighter aircraft to squadrons in the region.RTX Corp.: Its Missiles &amp; Defense unit, along with Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, manufactures the Iron Dome Weapon System. Notably, 10 Iron Dome batteries protect the citizens and infrastructure of Israel. These two companies also co-manufacture David’s Sling System, which forms a crucial element of Israel’s multi-tier layered missile defense architecture to provide mid-tier regional missile defense.RTX’s shares have risen 5.1% since Oct 6. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that military supplies already flowing into Israel contain interceptors for the Iron Dome missile defense.Boeing: Israel Aerospace Industries’ major structures work for Boeing’s F-15 program, avionics and spare parts for the V-22 Osprey, the T-38 Talon and T-45 Goshawk. In 2022, the company was awarded contracts to deliver four KC-46A tankers to Israel.BA’s shares have risen 3.3% since Oct 6. Following Hamas’ attack on Israel, Boeing has sped up the delivery of 1,000 smart bombs to the latter, per a report from Fox News. Meanwhile, Mr. Austin’s order also included the deployment of more F-15s in the region. This should boost Boeing, these jets’ manufacturer.L3Harris Technologies: In July 2023, L3Harris announced that it is expanding its partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries’ ELTA Systems Group (ELTA) to provide leading-edge, U.S. and NATO interoperable Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) solutions.The companies are offering a missionized Bombardier Global 6500, integrated by L3Harris, with ELTA’s latest next-generation AEW systems and operationally-proven Battle Management Command and Control Suite. The Global 6500 AEW&amp;C will fly higher, faster, longer and at a lower cost (to sustain, operate and maintain) than the existing AEW&amp;C platforms.LHX’s shares have risen 8.3% since Oct 6. Following the ongoing violence, we may expect further development in the aforementioned partnership to boost Israel’s airborne surveillance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS. The company's strong free cash flow generating ability is encouraging and supports its shareholder-friendly activities.(You can read the full research report on United Parcel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+49.3% vs. +33.2%). The company is benefiting from a substantial improvement in booking trends driven by growing demand for travel. This, in turn, is helping lower cancellation rates.Booking Holdings expects room night growth to increase at a low double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results. An uncertainty regarding the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CME Group Inc. and General Dynamics Corp.Story continuesWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and dividend yields, and go directly to read 5 Stocks with Highest Dividend Right Now. Dividend yields have always been a hot topic for investors. Many seek out stocks with generous yields, but these often come with less stability. However, when we look at historical data, it becomes clear that high-yield dividend stocks have displayed strong performances over different economic conditions.To highlight the significance of dividends on investment performance, consider research by Professor Jeremy Siegel in his 2005 book, ""The Future for Investors."" Professor Siegel categorized S&amp;P 500 dividend-paying stocks into groups, showing that concentrating on stocks with the highest dividend yields had a substantial impact on both performance and risk. The findings revealed that from 1957 to 2022, the top quintile of dividend-paying stocks outperformed the broader S&amp;P 500 Index by an annual average of 1.8%, leading to nearly 223% outperformance over time. Remarkably, this outperformance came with lower risk, as indicated by a lower beta. Even the second quintile outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 1.6% annually, resulting in over 196% outperformance over time, again with reduced risk.Also read: 16 Highest Paying Monthly Dividend StocksVarious other reports have also highlighted the importance of dividend stocks with high yields. According to a report by Danske Capital, these stocks have typically exhibited more favorable risk characteristics compared to stocks with no dividends. The report also referred to Deutsche Bank’s study and revealed that high-dividend stocks have performed better than the overall market during market downturns since 1927. Specifically, these stocks had a downside capture ratio of 81% or lower over extended periods, meaning that when the S&amp;P 500 Index went down, high dividend stocks typically decreased by about 19% less than the broader market.Story continuesVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) are some of the best dividend stocks with high yields as these companies also hold strong dividend growth tracks.

CEO, Joanne Crevoiserat, Recognized Among Top Business LeadersNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 12, 2023 / Tapestry, Inc.SummaryTapestry congratulates its CEO, Joanne Crevoiserat, for being named one of Forbes 100 Most Powerful Women in business! AS CEO, She leads the Executive Committee and Tapestry's overall strategic direction, including the Company's futurespeed plan which rests on five pillars: building lasting customer relationships, fueling fashion innovation and product excellence, delivering compelling omnichannel experiences, powering global growth, and unlocking the power of our people. Ms. Crevoiserat joined Tapestry in 2019 as Chief Financial Officer overseeing the financial management of the company, and was appointed Chief Executive Officer in 2020. She also serves on the Board of Directors. She joined the Board of the Partnership for New York City in May 2022 and was appointed to the board of General Motors Co. in August 2022. The Fashion Pact appointed her to its Steering Committee in April 2023.Originally published by FortuneThis year's list of the Most Powerful Women in business is the most comprehensive on record: a single worldwide list honoring 100 women. The list's new global scope and bigger scale recognize the nature of top executives' work-it spans the planet-as well as the near-record number of women who are leading companies on the Fortune 500, the largest in the U.S. by revenue, and the Fortune Global 500, the largest companies in the world.Joanne Crevoiserat, Tapestry CEOCrevoiserat is not a limelight-seeking CEO. That makes her an outlier in the fashion world, but the trait has served her well as she's led the parent company of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman out of a series of crises, including the abrupt departures of her two immediate predecessors and COVID's challenge to its business. On her watch, the once flailing Kate Spade has continued its turnaround, while Coach has restored its upscale aura, protecting Tapestry as the post-pandemic luxury boom waned. Crevoiserat's no-showboating but effective management style will be put to an even bigger test in 2024, when Tapestry is expected to close its $8.5 billion purchase of archrival Capri, owner of Michael Kors and Versace. The deal, if it isn't blocked by regulators, will merge two equals and turn Tapestry into a $12-billion-a-year luxury powerhouse. Still, Crevoiserat bristles at the suggestion she's a dealmaker; she sees the acquisition as a means for brand-building, not empire-building.Story continuesContinue reading here.Joanne Crevoiserat, CEO, TapestryView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/792321/forbes-100-most-powerful-women]"

Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has embarked on one of the largest factory-building sprees in chip-industry history, part of an audacious plan to revitalize the Silicon Valley pioneer. But he’s missing a key ingredient: enough paying customers.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Latest: Blinken Works on Gaza Aid as Biden Set to VisitYour Guide to Understanding the Roots of the Israel-Hamas WarPutin Arrives in China to Meet Xi on Rare International TripIsrael Latest: Army Says Hamas Officials Dead; Over 600,000 in Gaza Flee SouthXi’s $1 Trillion ‘Project of the Century’ Gets a Reality CheckGelsinger’s turnaround plan for Intel hinges on it becoming a so-called foundry — a contract manufacturer that makes chips for other companies — and he’s promised Wall Street that he’ll start revealing the names of those customers this year. Even just one big name would help investors justify bidding up Intel shares 47% over the past 12 months, at a time when sales are sliding and the chipmaker’s once-vaunted profit margins have narrowed.The foundry expansion is the company’s biggest pivot in decades. Intel’s business model since the start has been to design and build its own chips — with names like Pentium, Celeron and Xeon — that would power the world’s computers. But the company lost its technological edge. That led some computer makers to switch to Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and data-center operators even began designing their own chips or turned to Nvidia Corp.Pushing into the foundry market is a chance to show the industry that Intel has restored its manufacturing prowess.“If we’re going to be big, we must, in my view, also be a foundry,” Gelsinger, 62, said in an interview. “We’re starting to land some of our foundry customers right now.”Though Intel hasn’t named a major customer for this business, there have been some early steps. Ericsson AB has committed to making some networking chips in Intel’s factories, and Amazon.com Inc. is considering using it to package semiconductors that are manufactured elsewhere. Qualcomm Inc., meanwhile, is taking a look at chipmaking technology that Intel intends to introduce in 2025.Story continuesWhat analysts and investors are waiting for: a flagship customer willing to pay in advance to guarantee supply. If that is indeed coming this year, as Gelsinger has said, the deadline is just a couple months away. One customer, who Gelsinger hasn’t named, has prepaid for future supply, he’s said.“That’s something that people are waiting for,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. But even when the announcement comes, actually posting revenue from such a deal could be years away. “We’ve got a long slog ahead of us,” he said.The chipmaker had dominated its industry for decades before making manufacturing mistakes and losing market share. Intel now has less revenue than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co., and only a fraction of the market capitalization of Nvidia, whose chips have fueled the artificial intelligence boom.Read More: What Is Nvidia’s H100, the Chip Driving Generative AI?Gelsinger, an Intel veteran who left to run VMware Inc., returned to the company in 2021 to get it back on track. His plan is to reclaim technological leadership by 2025. As part of the comeback plan, Intel is building factories in Arizona, Ireland, Israel and Germany. Its biggest bet of all is a new facility in Ohio that it said will become the industry’s largest.It’s been a costly undertaking. Upgrading and expanding factories have wiped out profit and eaten into cash reserves, which once led the industry. The Santa Clara, California-based company has to catch and pass TSMC, whose factories produce the majority of the advanced components designed by Apple Inc., Amazon and Nvidia. It also has to somehow convince longtime competitors that it can be trusted to make their chips.Gelsinger knows this is a huge challenge. He runs the data to see how Intel compares with TSMC and Samsung multiple times in a week. He knows his products aren’t yet “world class.” And he knows companies will only use Intel’s foundry services when the company can prove it has the goods.“We fully realize that we have to earn our way into this business,” Gelsinger said. “Samsung, but particularly TSMC, is really good at this. They’ve been at it for 30 years. I’ve been at it for two years, right? Well, that’s a lot of learnings that we still have to go through.”The expense of outfitting a cutting-edge chip plant is staggering. In Intel’s new Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland — currently its most advanced production site — there’s a line of seven ASML Holding NV machines that are so valuable they’re known as “billion-dollar row.” Even the more rudimentary Muratec machines, which run on tracks overhead to move chips around the factory, each cost the equivalent of a new car.In Gelsinger’s favor, demand for the most advanced chip production is only growing. And there’s a desire to spread out the manufacturing so it’s not so concentrated in East Asia.So who could Intel’s marquee foundry customer be? Some investors are hoping it’s Nvidia, according to Bernstein’s Rasgon. Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, has said that he’s open to the idea.Intel’s longtime rival AMD is another possibility, but a long shot. That company gave up on manufacturing its own chips more than a decade ago. Like Nvidia, it contracts out its manufacturing to TSMC. When recently asked about the possibility of going to her competitor for supply, AMD CEO Lisa Su avoided answering directly and praised the relationship with TSMC.It may be easier to land customers such as Amazon, Alphabet Inc.’s Google or Microsoft Corp. because they don’t have the baggage of competing with Intel, according to Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso.But any big customer will need assurances that Intel’s manufacturing missteps are behind it, he said.“The challenge that Intel has is that they need to prove to these customers that its manufacturing is on the mend,” he said. “You’re staking your business on it. TSMC has been reliable.”Gelsinger thinks he’s starting to convince naysayers that Intel is back. The rally in the shares this year underscores that. But he acknowledges that he needs to be able to land a big fish.At the end of the day, Gelsinger said, it will come down to whether “Nvidia or Amazon or Google or Microsoft or Qualcomm or Apple” believe they can build a better product with Intel.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSRural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Best Aggressive Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.Despite the tensions in the Middle East, markets were optimistic recently after dovish comments from two Fed officials who believe the rising bond yields in the US would result in an environment where the Fed might not need to keep raising interest rates. According to Andrew Ticehurst, a rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., the Fed speakers were on the same page when it comes to bond yields and their effects. The analyst said that market pricing suggests that the Fed is not expected to increase rates this year. The market optimism is expected to stick until the end of the year, according to many analysts. The biggest growth driver could be strong earnings. Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Slimmon, who has been bullish on the stock market, said in an interview with Bloomberg that he expects a strong fourth quarter because the “pain” of staying out of the market will become acute and this will force retail and institutional investors to pile into stocks.Another reason why Slimmon is bullish on the market is that he believes earnings growth rate will turn positive year over year later this year. The analyst said that the amount of money the US government is expected to dole out under IRA, CHIPS and infrastructure acts is huge and would come into effect in the fourth quarter of 2023. He said that this “huge” money circulation will have a positive effect on the stock market and not many analysts are currently appreciating this factor.Slimmon said that this huge public spending will trick down to lower levels and could add to wage growth. What worries the analyst is that how the Fed would achieve its 2% inflation target in the presence of this potential wage growth. If the Fed is persistent on this 2% inflation target and government spending keeps wages up, we could end up in a vicious cycle where the Fed would be in a never-ending battle against an inflation that won’t go away.Story continuesAnother Bloomberg report quoted Slimmon as saying:“If you’re a portfolio manager, you’re seeing revisions are going up, and if you don’t own these stocks, it is painful every day. If you’re a strategist, you don’t have to get on the scale every day.”Bears RetreatingMany famous analysts who were bearish on the market are now on a retreat and revising their estimates, a sign that the market could rebound and end the year on a positive note. For example, Bloomberg reported in September that Societe Generale’s Manish Kabra upped target for the S&amp;P 500 index to 4,750 from 4,300. This is also much higher than the analyst’s original target of 3,800 which he set during the start of the year. Similarly, Piper Sandler &amp; Co.’s Michael Kantrowitz and BNP Paribas SA’s Greg Boutle have also increased their price targets for the broader indices for 2023. Currently all eyes are on the Fed and even the slightest bit of hints that the Fed won’t continue on its path of rate hikes could redouble the current optimism and have bears go in a further retreat. However, what happens in 2024 is a different story. If the Fed is not able to control inflation, there won’t be any rate cuts and the economy could face increased inflation and rate hikes for a long period of time.Best Aggressive Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge FundsLuis Louro / shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor this article, we first used a stock screener to identify all US companies with sales growth of over 25% over the past 5 years and PE ratios over 20.

We believe characteristics of a high-quality company include market leadership; recurring revenue or subscription model providing revenue visibility; high margins and operating leverage; high returns on capital; financial flexibility; and a strong management team with skin in the game and a long-term view.”11. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) ranks 11th in our list of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In September, HSBC praised Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) and gave it a Buy rating and a $500 price target.HSBC said that Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) shares are barely above the 2020 levels even when the company’s business is significantly bigger and the growth prospects are strong.“We have decided to initiate coverage as the name seems to gather more interest and we believe the equity story sits at the cross-roads of many business models,” HSBC said.Kinsman Oak Capital Partners made the following comment about Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“What is relatively new, however, is that we are beginning to see substantial write-downs and impairment charges. For instance, Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) is already exploring a sale of Mirror, the struggling fitness technology company it bought less than three years ago for half a billion dollars. Lululemon executives recently announced a $433 million impairment charge on the business (-89%). That is not an insignificant amount of money.”10. Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) ranks 10th in our list of the best aggressive growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. According to Yahoo Finance data, Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) was expected to see sales growth of a whopping 300% in the September quarter. For the whole year this growth was expected to come in at 23% while it would stand at about 12% next year.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 62 hedge funds out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO). The biggest stakeholder of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) during this period wasBaron FinTech Fund made the following comment about Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Tighter lending standards by banks may create more opportunities for private credit providers, such as Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO), Ares Management, Blackstone, and KKR. These lenders operate outside of the banking system to make loans to mostly privately held, middle-market companies. Instead of relying on bank deposits that can be withdrawn daily and are susceptible to runs and repricing, non-bank lenders fund loans using committed capital from investment vehicles, life insurance policies, and annuities that is more stable with a more predictable cost. This enables better asset-liability duration matching and reduces risk for multi-year loans against illiquid assets. Private credit is one of the fastest-growing segments in the lending landscape with close to $1.3 trillion in assets under management, having tripled in the last 10 years and expected to exceed $2 trillion in five years, according to Moody’s Corporation. As banks tighten credit standards and potentially face more onerous regulations, non-bank lenders will likely capture additional market share with attractive risk-adjusted returns. Jamie Dimon noted on JPMorgan’s recent earnings call that higher bank capital requirements is “great news” for private credit lenders who will be “dancing in the streets” as commercial lending moves out of the banking system. We expect Apollo Global will continue to benefit from growth in the private credit market.”9. KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) is expected to see sales growth of a whopping 36% in 2024, according to analyst data tracked by Yahoo Finance. Earlier this month Wolfe Research assigned an Outperform rating to KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR). Wolfe analyst Steven Chubak said KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR)’s flagship fundraising cycle is expected to provide an over 20% increase to run-rate management fees.As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, 62 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR).Greenhaven Road Capital made the following comment about KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) – The firm has been growing AUM in the mid-teens for decades. They are adding new products to appeal to the large pots of money directed by insurance companies, while also building out their offerings and personnel to go after high-net-worth investors, which currently make up less than 5% of AUM. In the short term, there will be fewer realizations (sales of companies), which will impact short-term distributable earnings, but as one of the handful of global private equity companies with a stellar brand and track record, it is highly likely with each passing day that more assets are raised. In the meantime, they have over $100B in “dry powder” that will be called from investors and invested/added to fee-paying AUM when KKR believes the time is right.”8. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62While Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) growth has slowed down over the past one year, the company is expected to post sales growth of over 10% next year, according to data from Yahoo Finance. In August Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) posted second quarter results. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $0.54, beating estimates by $0.08. Revenue in the period jumped 5.2% year over year to $3.1 billion, missing estimates by $150 million.Insider Monkey’s database of 910 hedge funds shows that 62 hedge funds had stakes in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) was Nitin Saigal and Dan Jacobs’ Kora Management which owns a $224 million stake in the company.Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) talked in detail about the state of business and future expectations in Q2 earning call.“…On the e-commerce side, regarding GMV and take rate, we see a sequential growth in GMV, and we did mention that we saw double-digit growth in order number quarter-on-quarter. So that’s an initial positive sign in relation to our ramp-up investments in Q2 already. Why we — in terms of take rates, as Tony probably already observed, we continue to see uptick in terms of advertisement and also so much spending on our platform, and therefore, the core marketplace revenue continues to grow as a result. But of course, there is some impact on the VAS revenue because of our ramp-up investment in logistics spending which affects due to GAAP accounting and netting off effects VAS GAAP revenue.And I think that might be an ongoing trend. So if we want to highlight that in terms of take rate, we would like to get people to look more at core marketplace take rate because VAS take rate will be affected by accounting treatment of shipping subsidies we may provide from time to time. And in terms of the — what’s going on that why we are reaccelerating our growth and investment in growth during this period of time? I think as we look at the past quarters, we have become the first and only e-commerce platform in our region that has achieved profitability at scale and that shows…”[Read the entire earnings call transcript here.]Hayden Capital made the following comment about Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“Sea Limited (NYSE:SE): It’s been a tough stretch for SE’s stock price, as the company continues to adapt its strategy over the past year.Two years ago, the company was growing its top-line at triple-digits, and every business was seemingly firing on all cylinders. But as market conditions changed and countries reopened from Covid, this put the brakes on all of Sea’s business lines. I’ve talked about these events extensively in prior letters, so partners can review the historical context here (please see our Q3 2022 and Q1 2023 letters).But as mentioned in our prior letters, I believe Sea’s team has done a remarkable job of stabilizing the business. The company has gone from losing ~-$900M a quarter (Q2 2022) a year ago, to now making ~+$300M per quarter (Q2 2023)22…” (Click here to read the full text)7. PDD Holdings Inc.

Their business consists of three segments: merchant acceptance, payments processing, and core bank processing. Each of these segments provides essential products and services to the customers.

283,5ac3bf02-1922-3a01-832a-4d1a8acd0606,TRV,2023-10-12,3 Insurance Stocks for Long-Term Dividend Growth,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-insurance-stocks-long-term-201811175.html,1696537091,STORY,"['AFL', 'EQH', 'TRV']","[Insurance stocks are attractive long-term investments for dividend growth investors. This is because the business model is appealing for investment.Top insurance companies produce a high level of profits each year because they make money in two ways. Not only do insurers collect premium income on the policies they underwrite but they also make money by investing the large sums of accumulated premiums that have not been paid out as claims.Due to this, many insurance stocks can be found on the various lists of long-term dividend growth stocks, such as the Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe following three insurance stocks have long histories of dividend growth, solid dividend yields above the S&amp;P 500 average, and long-term growth potential.Equitable Holdings (EQH)Equitable Holdings (EQH) company logo icon on website, Illustrative EditorialSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comEquitable Holdings (NYSE:EQH) is a leading financial services company specializing in individual retirement, group retirement, investment management and research, and protection solutions. With a history tracing back to 1859, the firm was formerly a fully owned subsidiary of France’s AXA. The company completed its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) in 2018 and has raised its dividend every year since.Equitable Holdings reported Q2 2023 earnings on Aug. 2. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $2.06 per share, compared to the $2.47 in earnings per share (EPS) in the same period of 2022. The company also declared a dividend of 22 cents per share of common stock. This dividend was paid on Aug. 14.The company outlined some key growth initiatives during its inaugural investor day in May and provided some meaningful updates to the company’s financial guidance to 2027, including $2 billion of cash generation and 12%-15% non-GAAP operating EPS. Importantly for dividend investors, the company has revised its payout ratio target to 60%-70% of non-GAAP operating earnings.Story continuesWe expect that earnings and dividends will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6% over the next five years, with expected 2028 EPS of around $7.36 and a dividend payment of $1.18 per share.With reliable earnings, and an extremely low payout ratio of 16%, Equitable Holdings is well-positioned to carry on its growth strategy even in the face of rising interest rates and an overall negative macro climate. With the consistent cash flows from premiums coming in, and a comparatively low dividend expense, there is plenty of room to continue raising dividends. EQH stock yields 3.2%.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL), founded in 1955, is the world’s largest underwriter of supplemental cancer insurance. The diversified insurance corporation also provides accident, short-term disability, critical illness, dental, vision and life insurance. Roughly 70% of the company’s pretax earnings are from Japan, with 30% coming from the U.S.Aflac has a tremendous history of dividend increases. It has increased its dividend for 41 consecutive years, placing it on the exclusive list of Dividend Aristocrats.On Aug. 1, Aflac announced second-quarter results for the period ending June 30. For the quarter, the company reported $5.17 billion in revenue, a 2.8% decline compared to Q2 of 2022. However, revenue was $700 million higher than expected. On an adjusted basis, EPS equaled $1.58 versus $2.16 in the year-ago period. Adjusted book value increased 11.5% to $46.61 per share.Aflac has two sources of revenue: income from premiums and income from investments. On the premium side, this is generally sticky with policy renewals making up the bulk of income. However, Aflac operates in two developed markets where we would not anticipate outsized growth in the business. The other lever available is on the investment side, where the vast majority of the portfolio is in bonds. Here there is a possibility for income improvement should rates continue to rise in the future.Share buybacks will also boost Aflac’s EPS growth. Aflac repurchased 10.5 million shares at an average price of $66.67 during the most recent quarter. The company has 95.8 million shares, or 16% of its outstanding share count, remaining on its repurchase authorization.Aflac is expected to earn $5.96 in 2023. This means the dividend payout ratio is expected to be just under 30% for 2023, which indicates a safe dividend. AFL stock currently yields 2.2%.The Travelers Companies (TRV)miniature home next to pen, pad of paper, calculator and coins on a deskSource: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.comThe Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) was founded in 1864. The company began with life and accident insurance but has expanded into other types of coverage in the 150+ years since then. Today, it generates over $37 billion in annual revenue. The company offers a wide and deep variety of protection products for auto, home and business customers.Travelers posted second-quarter earnings on July 20. Revenue was up 10.5% year-over-year to $10.1 billion, which was $750 million ahead of estimates. Catastrophe losses of $1.481 billion pre-tax was double the year-ago period. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio improved 170 bps to 91.1%.Net written premiums were a new record of $10.32 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Earnings premium of $9.22 billion against $8.85 billion a year ago, as earned premiums were higher in all three segments. Book value per share declined fractionally from last year’s Q2 to $95.46, which was driven by higher interest rates. Net investment income was $712 million, up from $707 million a year ago.We expect 6% EPS growth over the next five years, even with the lower earnings base for 2023. Travelers could achieve this growth primarily from higher underwritten premiums and the buyback program, although margins should play a part as well, as long as there aren’t any large catastrophes. We forecast low single-digit gains from higher revenue as well as a similar tailwind from the company’s buyback, which has reduced the float by about a third in just the past decade.TRV maintains a dividend payout ratio of approximately 33%, which indicates a very safe dividend. TRV stock yields 2.4%.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

I love it. You know, I think we could add to it what we’ve added to all of our sports.”Emanuel spoke Wednesday at the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles. The event covers the collision of Hollywood and Silicon Valley. It features leaders in media, sports and technology. Thursday’s lineup of speakers includes Netflix Inc. co-CEO Ted Sarandos, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, tennis great Maria Sharapova and reality TV star Kris Jenner.Considered one of the top talent agents in Hollywood, Emanuel co-founded the Endeavor agency in 1995, merging it later with one of the oldest names in the business, William Morris.Endeavor has since expanded into events and sports ownership, acquiring the mixed martial arts league Ultimate Fighting Championship in a 2016 deal valued at $4 billion. Last month, Emanuel completed a merger of that business with World Wrestling Entertainment, creating a giant in the world of combat sports called TKO Group Holdings Inc.Story continuesEmanuel called for striking screen actors and Hollywood studios to come to the table to end the three-month long dispute that’s put the film and TV industry on hold.“I don’t think they want us agents involved,” said Emanuel, who added his company recently signed deals for Tyler Perry and producer David Ellison at Netflix. “When you’re in negotiation, get half the loaf and move along.”Donna Langley, chief content officer for TV and film giant NBCUniversal, also spoke at the Screentime event, expressing her concern that without a settlement to Hollywood’s labor troubles, next year’s film lineup will suffer.“One of the reasons why I’m so focused on bringing a resolution to the strike is not being able to finish the films that are being shut down,” she said. “If I learned anything during Covid, the lack of volume really impacts the movie-going cadence.”Langley, who participated in contract talks with striking screenwriters, said concerns about artificial intelligence taking jobs are premature.“We are big believers in the fact that creativity comes from a human being,” she said. “In the production universe, there are things that AI will enable. Other things to look at are marketing, efficiencies, things that have nothing to do with performance.”Emanuel said he was impressed by the turnaround being led by Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. CEO David Zaslav, and that Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger would also be successful. He was critical of Paramount Global, the Redstone-family controlled parent of CBS, MTV and other channels.“I think Zas has figured it out,” Emanuel said. “He went through that tough year where he was getting killed. Bob’s going through it now. He’s a very good executive. He’ll figure it out. I would not put my money on Paramount.”He also questioned the outlook for Fox Corp., controlled by the Murdochs. “I think there’s gonna be rough times at Fox,” he said. “Just because the demographic is getting older and you know, you’ve got family issues.”Emanuel had strong words for rival Creative Artists Agency, which has been sued by a former client who said the company didn’t do enough to stop producer Harvey Weinstein and his sexual harassment. Emanuel said leadership at CAA, Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane, needed to step aside and permit a thorough outside investigation. CAA has called the claims “completely without merit.”(Updates with comments on CAA, actors’ strike and media giants.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWall Street’s Surprising Quest for Ways to Finance Coal AgainAd-Free Versions of Facebook and Instagram Have One Audience in Mind: RegulatorsIntroducing The Businessweek Show With Max AbelsonThe K-Pop Mogul Behind BTS Is Building the Next BTSRural America Is Losing Nursing Homes, and Small Towns Are Reeling©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The company's earnings report is set to go public on November 2, 2023. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $4.71, signifying a 46.73% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

(Photo: Hyliion Holdings)Hyliion Holdings is pausing orders of its Hypertruck ERX heavy-duty natural gas-electric powertrain as part of a strategic review ordered by its board of directors concerned with how the startup can reach commercial scale.“All options” are possible, CEO Thomas Healy said on a six-minute conference call Wednesday during which he took no questions. The contents of the call mostly mirrored a statement the company issued after markets closed Tuesday.“Hyliion, like others, has experienced slower-than-anticipated market adoption as fleets undertake a gradual transition to electric trucks,” the company said in the statement.Unlike other startups that have run out of cash, Hyliion is fairly flush. It had $354 million in cash and investments as of June 30. That works out to about $1.50 a share. But investors fled the stock (NYSE: HYLN) on Wednesday. Shares traded at 69 cents intraday, down 42%. During the height of the special purpose acquisition company frenzy, shares traded above $55. Hyliion went public in a $560 million reverse merger with SPAC Tortoise Acquisition Corp. in September 2020.“Hyliion’s ongoing participation in commercial vehicle electrification will require continued investment, while addressing escalating component and production costs, meeting ongoing regulatory requirements, and aligning with a new CARB mandate for fleet adoption of electric trucks,” the statement said.Hyliion’s board has questioned the company’s plan to control cash burn and raise money needed to commercialize the Hypertruck ERX and generator technology Hyliion purchased last year from General Electric. After initially considering the Karno multi-fuel generator technology for a second version of the Hypertruck, the company decided to pursue stationary applications, like backup power for data centers.CARB approval is time limitedThe Austin, Texas-based company recently received California Air Resource Board certification of the Cummins 12-liter natural gas engine in the Hypertruck. However, the approval is good only for the 2024 model year. Cummins is phasing out the 12-liter in coming years. A new, more powerful 15-liter natural gas engine replaces the 12-liter. It is getting strong fleet interest.Story continuesHyliion will continue Hypertruck ERX fleet trial and complete 30 trucks planned for customer deliveries in early 2024. However, it is pausing new orders until the strategic review is complete. CEO Thomas Healy told FreightWaves in September that Hyliion would pursue certifying the Cummins’ 15-liter engine with CARB. But that is now apparently part of the strategic review.‘Right time to consider a host of strategic options’“We believe now is the right time to consider a host of strategic options for our electric powertrain business to ensure that we deploy capital most effectively and maximize value for our shareholders,” Healy said.Hyliion could be put up for sale. But it is unclear who might buy it given that its only product to date is a low-volume bolt-on hybrid for diesel and natural gas trucks. Supply chain constraints delayed the Hypertruck ERX by a year. Its costs continue to rise because suppliers are scarce and volume projections are low. That makes the costs of components more expensive.“While Hyliion’s capital position is currently strong, its proprietary technology is transformative, and commercialization is progressing on track, additional future capital will ultimately need to be raised against the backdrop of uncertain market conditions if we continue on our current trajectory,” Healy said.Editor’s note: Updates throughout.The post Hyliion may drop Hypertruck ERX as strategic review begins appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The company first announced the price hikes in August.As a result of the hikes, the price of the Disney+ ad-free plan jumped to $13.99 a month in the US, up from the prior $10.99. That's now double the $6.99 monthly cost Disney charged for the service when it first launched in 2019.Hulu's ad-free plan increased by $3 a month to $17.99 a month. The ad-supported tiers for both services will remain $7.99 each.Price hikes will also hit Disney's two Hulu live TV packages with prices increasing by $7 each for both the ad-free plan and the ad-supported offering. ESPN+ will go up by $1 to $10.99 a month.Disney reported streaming losses that totaled $512 million in its fiscal third quarter results — about half of the $1.1 billion loss reported in the prior-year period and less than the $777 million loss forecast by analysts. The company reported a streaming loss of $659 million in Q2 and a $1.1 billion loss in Q1.Despite the narrowing loss, the company continues to shed subscribers. The media giant reported 146.1 million total Disney+ subscribers at the end of its latest quarter, a 7.4% decline from the previous quarter. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected to see paying users total 154.8 million.The majority of its subscriber losses came from its Indian brand Disney+ Hotstar, which saw users drop by 24% on a sequential basis. Disney said Hotstar is not material to the company due to its lower average revenue per user, or ARPU.Domestic users, however, which include those in the US and Canada, dropped by 1%.LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 06: Disney CEO Bob Iger attends the World Premiere of ""The King's Man"" at Cineworld Leicester Square on December 06, 2021 in London, England. (Photo by Dave J Hogan/Getty Images)In addition to streaming headwinds, the company's parks business is slowing, its linear TV division is declining, and the media giant's box office also seems to have lagged competitors.Story continuesIger has committed to several new initiatives to help realign the business — from putting Disney's linear assets up for sale and searching for a strategic partner for ESPN's streaming offering to partnering with sports gambling company Penn Entertainment (PENN) and recently raising theme park prices.But that might not be enough to satisfy investors with the stock sinking to a nine-year low last week.Late Sunday, the company faced renewed pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz, who launched yet another attack on the media giant.According to sources familiar with the matter, Peltz will seek multiple board seats, including one for himself, after his hedge fund Trian Fund Management boosted its stake in the company, which is now valued at a reported $2.5 billion for more than 30 million shares.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The union resumed negotiations with studios last week after the Writers Guild of America (WGA) ended its work stoppage.The WGA deal had raised hopes for a quick resolution with actors until the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), late on Wednesday, said talks were suspended once it reviewed the most recent union proposal.""After meaningful conversations, it is clear that the gap between the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA is too great, and conversations are no longer moving us in a productive direction,"" said the AMPTP, which represents Netflix, Walt Disney and other media companies.SAG-AFTRA, in a letter to members issued early Thursday, said it had negotiated ""in good faith"" with studios ""despite the fact that last week they presented an offer that was, shockingly, worth less than they proposed before the strike began.""""It is with profound disappointment that we report the industry CEOs have walked away from the bargaining table after refusing to counter our latest offer,"" union negotiators said.One issue of contention is a SAG-AFTRA demand for a share of streaming revenue delivered as a bonus to cast members. The AMPTP said the proposal ""would cost more than $800 million per year, which would create an untenable economic burden.""SAG-AFTRA countered that the AMPTP had overstated the cost by 60% and accused the studios of ""bully tactics.""Story continuesThe union also said studios ""refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI,"" while the AMPTP said it had promised to obtain actors' consent before using any digital replicas of their likenesses.On issues such as general wage increases and residuals for high-budget streaming shows, the AMPTP said it had offered the same terms that were ratified by the WGA and the Directors Guild of America, but that SAG-AFTRA rejected them.Members of the WGA approved a new three-year contract with major studios this week, five months after the union called a strike. The new contract provides pay raises, some protections around AI use and other gains.(Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Gursimran Kaur in Bengaluru; Editing by Kim Coghill, Robert Birsel)]"

The daily ticket price for high-demand days, usually $179, has increased to $194, up 8%.The Theme Park Insider outlined Disneyland prices for multi-day tickets, showing it rose between 9% and 16%.Disneyland Multi-day ticket prices:Two-day tickets rose $25 to $310.Three-day tickets rose $30 to $390.Four-day tickets rose $50 to $445.Five-day tickets rose $65 to $480.Walt Disney World Resort also announced Wednesday it is bringing back all-day Park Hopper access beginning 9 January. The Park Hopper access was put on hold during the pandemic and then brought back in 2021 with restricted access from 2 p.m.“Multi-day tickets allow you admission to one theme park per day. To add Park Hopping to a Disneyland Resort multi-day ticket is more expensive now,” said Theme Park Insider Founder Robert Niles. “While Park Hopping for a one-day ticket remains a $65 upcharge, Park Hopping for a five-day ticket is up $15 to $75.”Disney World Daily Ticket Price UnchangedWalt Disney World also raised the price of its annual passes by almost 10% but did not increase the price of daily tickets to its theme parks, added Niles. However, the price for parking at one of Disney World’s theme parks is up $5 today, to $30 per vehicle per day.Walt Disney World Annual Pass Prices:Disney Pixie Dust Pass is up 10%, from $399 to $439 plus tax. Renewal is now $369 plus tax.Disney Pirate Pass is up 6.7%, from $749 to $799 plus tax. Renewal is now $679 plus tax.Disney Sorcerer Pass is up 3.1%, from $969 to $999 plus tax. Renewal is now $849 plus tax.Disney Incredi-Pass is up 3.6%, from $1,399 to $1,449 plus tax. Renewal is now $1,229 plus tax.Story continuesOverall inflation in the U.S. is currently near 4%.“Disney could be betting that a monthly increase of $3.50 to $4.25 in payments isn’t going to cause that many pass holders to cancel, and they’ll still earn more revenue than if they didn’t increase prices,” said Touring Plans’ Len Testa. “In the overall scheme of things, it’s minor compared to the expense of paying for Genie+ and Individual Lightning Lane. And Disney’s not about to give up that revenue, no matter how much people complain.”Strategic HikesA spokesperson commenting on the increased Disney ticket prices said, “We are constantly adding new, innovative attractions and entertainment to our parks and, with our broad array of pricing options, the value of a theme park visit is reflected in the unique experiences that only Disney can offer.”Disney CEO Bob Iger recently detailed plans to significantly increase investment in its park division to the tune of  $60 billion over 10 years.However, Disney’s decisions suggest that things are going much better for them right now in California than in Florida, according to Niles.“Disneyland got hefty price increases in daily tickets and annual passes, while Walt Disney World only saw minor annual pass increases,” said Niles. “And Disney also relaxed park-hopping and reservation restrictions in Florida, while they remain in place on the West Coast.”Managing AttendanceNiles said the plan may be to ease crowds in California while boosting attendance in Florida.“I don’t see this prompting a huge response in the industry. Everyone in Florida has been discounting to drive attendance already. In California, Universal is breaking its attendance records with Super Nintendo World, so it has no need to try to undercut Disney on price any more than it already does. And no one else in California is in the same league as them,” said Niles.Jonathan de Araujo, the founder of travel agency, The Vacationeer said typically annual ticket price increase from Disney are expected.“It’s always a little disappointing because we know it will price some families out of visiting Disney World or Disneyland, but the fact that it also helps manage the sometimes overwhelmingly large crowds at the parks can be a bit of a silver lining. Bottom line, don’t ever wait until next year hoping prices will go down. They won’t,” said De Araujo.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"
295,18ab4cf3-6a35-3953-a4af-cbeb5463acfd,MTB,2023-10-12,What's in the Cards for M&T Bank (MTB) in Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-cards-m-t-bank-152000901.html,1697037600,STORY,['MTB'],"[M&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s earnings and revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year improvements.In the last reported quarter, M&amp;T Bank surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on a rise in net interest income (NII), supported by decent loan demand and higher rates. Other income improved in the quarter. However, a rise in adjusted expenses was the undermining factor.The stock has surpassed the consensus estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once. It has a four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 5.14%, on average.M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&amp;T Bank Corporation QuoteKey Factors &amp; Q3 EstimatesLoans &amp; NII: Demand for commercial and industrial loans remained muted in July and August, per the Fed’s latest data. Moreover, commercial real estate loans declined in July and August from the second-quarter end. Nonetheless, the demand for consumer loans was decent during the same time. Given M&amp;T Bank’s substantial exposure to commercial loans, its loan growth in the quarter under review is likely to have been affected.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets of $189.87 billion indicates a sequential rise of 2.1%. We estimate average interest-earning assets of $200.5 billion.The Federal Reserve raised the interest rates by another 25 basis points in the quarter under review. Thus, the policy rate reached 5-5.25% in July 2023, marking the 11th time FOMC has hiked interest rates in a tightening process that began in March 2022. In September, the rate hike was paused. With this, interest rates reached a target of 5.25-5.5% in the third quarter, marking the highest level in around 22 years.Despite the high interest rate environment, softer loan demand, and higher deposit and wholesale funding costs are anticipated to have negatively impacted NII in the quarter to be reported.Story continuesThe company expects NII to decline sequentially to $1.765-$1.775 billion from the $1.81 billion reported as of the second-quarter end.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.75 billion suggests a 2.7% decrease from the prior quarter’s reported number. We estimate the metric to be $1.73 billion.Fee Income: Trust income is likely to have declined in the to-be-reported quarter due to the sale of its collective investment trust (CIT) business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric of $155 million indicates a 10% sequential decline.The consensus estimate for trading account and other non-hedging derivative gains is pegged at $12.92 million, indicating a sequential decline of 22.9%.The consensus mark for other revenues from operations is pegged at $151 million, implying a sequential fall of 5.6%.As of the end of August, MTB’s average deposit balances sequentially increased 2% to $162.5 billion. However, the removal of non-sufficient fund fees and overdraft protection transfer charges from linked-deposit accounts is likely to have continued affecting revenues from service charges on deposits in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for the metric is pegged at $117 million, indicating a sequential 1.7% fall.In the third quarter, mortgage rates continued to increase, with the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 7.31% in September, the highest level in nearly 23 years. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing, than the prior-year quarter. Nonetheless, an improvement in the mortgage servicing rights valuation is likely to have offered support. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking revenues of $107 million suggests no sequential change.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for brokerage services income of $24.19 million suggests a 3.7% decline from the second-quarter reported figure.We expect total fee income to be $552.4 million in the third quarter, indicating a sequential decline of 31.2%.Expenses: The company’s expense base is expected to have declined sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter due to lower expenses related to the sale of the CIT business. Management expects operating expenses to be sequentially down 1-2% to $1.255-$1.270 billion. This excludes an estimated $183 million FDIC special assessment and intangible amortization expenses. We estimate total expenses of $1.25 billion.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for M&amp;T Bank this time around.

297,f3f58377-b773-312f-84f8-d62c45a1e0b4,MTB,2023-10-12,M&T Bank Corporation (MTB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-corporation-mtb-140030254.html,1697032830,STORY,['MTB'],"[The market expects M&amp;T Bank Corporation (MTB) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.1%.Revenues are expected to be $2.32 billion, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.73% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for M&amp;T Bank Corporation?For M&amp;T Bank Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.61%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that M&amp;T Bank Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that M&amp;T Bank Corporation would post earnings of $4.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.12, delivering a surprise of +24.57%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.M&amp;T Bank Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Wells Fargo (WFC), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -3.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $20.2 billion, up 3.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Wells Fargo has been revised 3.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 2.11%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Wells Fargo will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It is worth considering Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry.When looking at the last two reports, this cloud services provider has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.87%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Akamai Technologies was expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, but it reported $1.49 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.32 per share, while it actually produced $1.40 per share, a surprise of 6.06%.For Akamai Technologies, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Akamai Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 7, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) does use debt in its business. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive How Much Debt Does Colgate-Palmolive Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Colgate-Palmolive had debt of US$8.99b, up from US$7.99b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.09b, its net debt is less, at about US$7.90b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Colgate-Palmolive's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.63b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$11.3b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.09b as well as receivables valued at US$1.66b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$13.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Colgate-Palmolive has a very large market capitalization of US$56.9b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Colgate-Palmolive's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 16.5 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Unfortunately, Colgate-Palmolive saw its EBIT slide 6.4% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue on that decline then managing that debt will be difficult like delivering hot soup on a unicycle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Colgate-Palmolive recorded free cash flow worth 68% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewOn our analysis Colgate-Palmolive's interest cover should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For example, its EBIT growth rate makes us a little nervous about its debt. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Colgate-Palmolive is managing its debt quite well. But a word of caution: we think debt levels are high enough to justify ongoing monitoring. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with Colgate-Palmolive , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

While fiber remains a competitive alternative to cable broadband over the long term, high upfront investments and a materially higher cost of capital are resulting in slower buildouts than previously expected. Fixed wireless also continues to gain traction, particularly in rural markets, but share gains also appear to be moderating. At the same time, both Comcast and Charter are expanding their footprints into rural and adjacent markets while gaining wireless market share, leveraging their mobile virtual network operator agreements with Verizon.

If you want to see some more of the world’s biggest asset managers, go directly to the 5 Biggest Publicly Traded Asset Managers.An asset manager handles combined funds for their clients, investing them accordingly. While hedge funds may be the most widely recognized type of asset management company, there exist various other categories of asset managers, including those overseeing mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds.In 2022, asset managers encountered a challenging period as assets under management (AuM) plummeted to $115.1 trillion, marking a nearly 10% decrease from the 2021 peak of $127.5 trillion. This decline was the most substantial in a decade. Looking ahead to the coming two years, inflation, market volatility, and shifts in interest rates are the primary concerns for both investors and asset managers. Nonetheless, PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, anticipates a recovery by 2027, projecting AuM to attain a base case of $147.3 trillion, showcasing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%.As we move further into the second half of the year, the stock market is beginning to reflect the expected impacts of the impending recession, aligning with predictions from J.P. Morgan Research. The firm anticipates a gradual economic decline in the United States by late 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, resulting in tighter credit conditions that will gradually dampen economic growth. While many stocks are on a downward trend, certain industries are flourishing despite this economic strain, presenting attractive investment opportunities for global investors. Some noteworthy sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, and DIY, along with related industries.The asset and wealth management sector is undergoing significant transformations due to a range of hurdles, including pressure on fees, escalating costs, and shifting investor preferences. These challenges are further heightened by market instability, increasing interest rates, inflation, and impending economic downturns. Nevertheless, the fundamental foundation of the industry remains robust, offering potential for appealing profitability. Moreover, there's a growing interest in alternative investments, thematic investment demands, and a preference for digital engagement. To capitalize on opportunities within the asset management domain, some top publicly traded options for investors include the likes of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).Story continuesBiggest Publicly Traded Asset ManagersPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this list of the 25 biggest publicly traded asset managers in the world, we used the rankings of The SWFI and ranked institutions by the total managed AUM.

308,e32f1a41-6ae2-3c74-9f8d-868bb99f38f7,URI,2023-10-12,United Rentals' (NYSE:URI) five-year earnings growth trails the 26% YoY shareholder returns,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-nyse-uri-five-130019372.html,1697029219,STORY,['URI'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Long term United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE:URI) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 218% in five years. It's even up 5.4% in the last week. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 3.1% in a week.The past week has proven to be lucrative for United Rentals investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. Check out our latest analysis for United Rentals While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, United Rentals achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 26% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that United Rentals has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at United Rentals' financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for United Rentals the TSR over the last 5 years was 221%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that United Rentals shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 63% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 26% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for United Rentals   you should know about.Of course United Rentals may not be the best stock to buy.

Roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries with favorable current standings.Aside from the favorable earnings outlook, let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of Amazon.Current StandingAs mentioned previously, Amazon shares have been big-time performers in 2023, up more than 50% and widely outperforming the S&amp;P 500's impressive 14% YTD gain on the back of an improved operating environment and a strong consumer.The company's success in 2023 has been reflected by its quarterly performance, with Amazon exceeding Zacks Consensus EPS and revenue estimates in three consecutive quarters. In its latest print, the market titan delivered an 85% EPS beat and posted revenue 2% ahead of expectations.The heavyweight is scheduled to reveal its next set of quarterly results near late October. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.58 suggests a 190% improvement from the year-ago quarter, with our $141.9 billion quarterly revenue estimate implying growth of 11.6% year-over-year.Story continuesThe revisions trend has been notably bullish for the quarter-to-be-reported, with the $0.58 per share consensus estimate up nearly 50% since July.In addition, it was recently revealed that Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an AI safety and research company based in San Francisco and a rival of OpenAI. We're all aware that AI is Wall Street's shiny new toy in 2023, constantly dominating headlines.The deal reflects a partnership to develop reliable and high-performing foundation models, with AWS now becoming Anthropic's primary cloud provider for critical workloads. Regarding AWS expectations for the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS Net Sales stands at $23.2 billion, 13% higher than the year-ago figure.The company has recently exceeded consensus expectations for AWS Net Sales in back-to-back releases.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Amazon would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Estee Lauder Companies is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. The company's products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In addition, the stock currently resides in the Zacks – Cosmetics industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 24% (191 out of 251) of all Zacks Industries.

Shares have regularly faced selling pressure following quarterly releases.Regarding the latest release, the company exceeded consensus expectations handily but delivered weak results compared to the year-ago period; revenue saw 1.4% growth year-over-year, whereas adjusted EPS decreased 80% compared to the same period last year.The company's shareholder-friendly nature is worth highlighting, with EL sporting an 11% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares presently yield a solid 1.9% annually paired with a payout ratio sitting at 77% of the company's earnings.The company enters its FY24 with a continued focus on accelerating balanced and profitable growth across regions, brands, product categories, and channels.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.The Estee Lauder Companies is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:What to Expect from Domino's (DPZ) EarningsDomino's Pizza, Inc.is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 12, before the opening bell.

If you want to see some more of the world’s biggest asset managers, go directly to the 5 Biggest Publicly Traded Asset Managers.An asset manager handles combined funds for their clients, investing them accordingly. While hedge funds may be the most widely recognized type of asset management company, there exist various other categories of asset managers, including those overseeing mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds.In 2022, asset managers encountered a challenging period as assets under management (AuM) plummeted to $115.1 trillion, marking a nearly 10% decrease from the 2021 peak of $127.5 trillion. This decline was the most substantial in a decade. Looking ahead to the coming two years, inflation, market volatility, and shifts in interest rates are the primary concerns for both investors and asset managers. Nonetheless, PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, anticipates a recovery by 2027, projecting AuM to attain a base case of $147.3 trillion, showcasing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%.As we move further into the second half of the year, the stock market is beginning to reflect the expected impacts of the impending recession, aligning with predictions from J.P. Morgan Research. The firm anticipates a gradual economic decline in the United States by late 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, resulting in tighter credit conditions that will gradually dampen economic growth. While many stocks are on a downward trend, certain industries are flourishing despite this economic strain, presenting attractive investment opportunities for global investors. Some noteworthy sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, and DIY, along with related industries.The asset and wealth management sector is undergoing significant transformations due to a range of hurdles, including pressure on fees, escalating costs, and shifting investor preferences. These challenges are further heightened by market instability, increasing interest rates, inflation, and impending economic downturns. Nevertheless, the fundamental foundation of the industry remains robust, offering potential for appealing profitability. Moreover, there's a growing interest in alternative investments, thematic investment demands, and a preference for digital engagement. To capitalize on opportunities within the asset management domain, some top publicly traded options for investors include the likes of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and BlackRock, Inc.

The strategy performed strongly in this environment outperforming the Russell 1000 Value Index.

On October 11, 2023, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) stock closed at $155.30 per share. One-month return of United Parcel Service, Inc.

(NYSE:UPS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:""A higher-for-longer rate mentality taking hold was a headwind for economically sensitive stocks. Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.""Story continuesA warehouse filled with boxes of parcels, symbolizing the companies reliable logistics services.

However, no FedEx flights have been detected on flight tracking website FlightAware. A spokeswoman would only say, “We continue to provide service in Israel in line with government requirements and are closely monitoring the situation.” FedEx’s language suggests that the package carrier is using third-party airlift, including passenger airlines, to maintain network connections with Tel Aviv.Meanwhile, DHL Express has continued air cargo flights to Tel Aviv without interruption since Hamas militants from Gaza invaded Israel over the weekend.Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, which operates a large fleet of jumbo jet freighters in addition to widebody passenger aircraft, said Wednesday that all flights to Tel Aviv through Oct. 29 have been canceled. U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines previously said it would not fly to Israel for the rest of the month, and Delta Cargo issued an advisory that it has implemented an embargo for Tel Aviv on imports and exports until then.Story continuesMeanwhile, American Airlines cut flights to Tel Aviv until at least Dec. 5 after Israeli officials warned of a lengthy war.British Airways also announced Wednesday that it is suspending service to Israel and ordered one of its jets to return to London just before landing at Ben Gurion Airport. Air France/KLM suspended all flights to Israel until further notice, and the cargo division said it has closed all cargo bookings and operations to Tel Aviv until Oct. 20.The steep drop in passenger flights to Israel reduces a major conduit for shipping goods and raises the question of whether freighter operators will step into the void to maintain trade for Israel.Exports account for about 40% of Israel’s gross domestic product, according to Trading Economics. Top export commodities include diamonds and other precious metals and stones; electrical machinery and equipment; sound and TV recorders; and computer equipment.A DHL freighter is parked at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion International Airport.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including United Parcel Service, Inc., Booking Holdings Inc. and Lockheed Martin Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS.

The company is benefiting from a substantial improvement in booking trends driven by growing demand for travel. This, in turn, is helping lower cancellation rates.Booking Holdings expects room night growth to increase at a low double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results.

But unlike its 2023 IPO peers, the company has a deep-rooted history.The nearly 250-year-old company plans to offer 10.75 million shares at $46 a share on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""BIRK.""That price, in the middle of its initial range of $44 to $49 per share, sets up the company to raise roughly $1.48 billion. When combined with ordinary shares outstanding after the completion of the offering, it puts Birkenstock's total valuation at $8.6 billion.This is just another chapter for the Germany-based footwear brand. Founded in 1774, the brand's origin story began 249 years ago. Yet, the Birkenstock brand has managed to stay relevant all these years, now going on the ultimate stage.The brand is ""like rediscovering an old vinyl record and realizing it’s a timeless hit,"" Sunny Bonnell, CEO and founder of branding agency Motto, told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""Birkenstock wears its history and values like a badge of honor.""A Birkenstock banner hangs outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York on Oct. 11, 2023, as Birkenstock launches an initial public offering. (ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) (ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images)Many of the companies that have gone public in 2023 are not only newcomers to the public market but also have more recent histories.England-based tech company Arm (ARM) was founded as a company in 1990. The Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava (CAVA) opened its first location in 2010. And grocery delivery service company Instacart (CART) launched in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2012, the same year software company Klaviyo (KVYO) was founded.Birkenstock's rich heritage is also deeper than other legacy companies at the time of their IPOs: Goldman Sachs went public 130 years after it was founded, American Express was 127 years old at the time of its public debut, Johnson &amp; Johnson went public at 108 years, and Campbell Soup joined the public markets after 85 years of business.A nearly 250-year-old company goes publicThe Birkenstock brand is older than the United States.According to the company's website, the footwear brand's origin can be traced back to 1774 to Johann Adam Birkenstock, who was listed as ""subject and cobbler"" in the church archives in Langen-Bergheim, Germany.Story continuesMore than 100 years later, in 1896, Johann’s great-great-grandson, Konrad Birkenstock, became known as a ""master cobbler"" and began manufacturing and selling the ""flexible footbed insoles.""In 1902, Konrad created the contoured arch support that Birkenstock is known for, and in 1925, Birkenstock opened a new factory in Friedberg, Germany, to make the ""blue footbed,"" which it still sells today.The business started picking up in the 1960s with the introduction of its first one-strap fitness sandal, called the Madrid Model.In 1966, Birkenstocks came to the US market. Expanding into the US ""provided numerous opportunities for the Birkenstock brand to grow, particularly in California where there was a new culture of young consumers who valued function, purpose and individuality,"" the company said in its S-1 filing.A Birkenstock advertisement in 1972. (Birkenstock)Birkenstock continued to grow. In 2021, brothers Christian Birkenstock and Alex Birkenstock led the decision to sell a majority stake of the company to private equity firm L Catterton, and its affiliates including Bernard Arnault's luxury goods investment company, Financière Agache.The company also named Oliver Reichert, who is now taking the company public, as the sole CEO.""Despite this heritage, Birkenstock remains empowered by a youthful energy level, with all the freshness and creative versatility of an inspired Silicon Valley startup,"" Reichert wrote ahead of Birkenstock's IPO. ""We have retained the original spirit of our forefathers who laid the foundation of a global business that is more relevant than ever before.""Birkenstock today: A multibillion-dollar companyIn fiscal year 2022, the company brought in 1.24 billion euros, growing at an annual rate of 20% from fiscal 2014 to last year. It also sold sold 30 million units in 2022.Word of mouth is the company's biggest marketing strategy. The company said in a filing that its universal nature allows it to appeal to ""a broad range of consumers across age, gender, and socio-economic demographics.""That gives the brand a leg up compared to other brands as well as others in the 2023 IPO class.""Imagine a band that doesn’t advertise yet sells out concerts,"" Bonnell said. ""That’s Birkenstock. When a brand earns trust and love, it’s like igniting a bonfire.""Although the company is on its seventh generation of leadership, it can tap into any age, Bonnell added.""It may seem like the boomer hippie in a room full of millennials and Gen Z, but that's its genius,"" she explained. ""The brand speaks the language of the youth.""Pedestrians pass a Birkenstock store on Oct. 10, 2023, in Venice, Calif. (Ethan Swope/Getty Images) (Ethan Swope via Getty Images)Now, this centuries-old company is being put to the ultimate test.""Maybe this is the real test as to whether the IPO market is reopening for real or whether this was a false storm,"" Ben Laidler, eToro global markets strategist, told Yahoo Finance over the phone.Torch Capital's founder and managing partner Jon Keidan is wary that an ongoing pullback in consumer spending could hurt the company.""Birkenstocks falls into nice-to-have,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live. ""And if people are tightening their belts, that may be the type of purchase that they may not make [in] the next year or two.""Furthermore, Barrett Daniels, US IPO services co-leader at Deloitte, is skeptical about investors' appetite for new players on the market.""I would say it's not a perfect IPO window, but it's a window,"" he told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The demand is there, the investment demand, but the question is who's ready to go? And I don't think the pipeline is quite where we thought it was.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Smucker has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Mondelez has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that SJM has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.SJM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.95, while MDLZ has a forward P/E of 19.62. We also note that SJM has a PEG ratio of 1.84. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. MDLZ currently has a PEG ratio of 2.17.Another notable valuation metric for SJM is its P/B ratio of 1.69. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MDLZ has a P/B of 3.02.These metrics, and several others, help SJM earn a Value grade of B, while MDLZ has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesSJM sticks out from MDLZ in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that SJM is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the second quarter.Management is focused on expanding these categories and expects solid volume momentum for both these categories as it moves forward in 2023. The company has undertaken several acquisitions in this regard. The acquisition of Ricolino (completed in the third quarter of 2023) is expected to double the size of MDLZ's Mexican operations, and the purchase of Clif Bar (in August 2022) has bolstered the company's market presence. These acquisitions made meaningful contributions to net revenues in the second quarter of 2023.Additionally, the integration of Chipita S.A. and Grenade (in 2022) underscores Mondelez's commitment to expanding its product offerings. The company's acquisition spree, further underlined by Gourmet Food Holdings and Hu Master Holdings, has diversified its portfolio and enhanced its distribution capabilities.Meanwhile, Mondelez is committed to increasing its focus on areas with higher growth potential through meaningful divestitures. On Oct 2, the company concluded the divestiture of its developed-market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe (excluding Portugal) to Perfetti Van Melle Group.

The reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.4%.Revenues for the fiscal first quarter increased 73% on a year-over-year basis to $228.9 million. Core revenues declined 1.3%. Acquisitions and discontinued product lines contributed 73.5%. The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%. Per management, the Animal Safety business experienced continued destocking as anticipated, with channel inventory levels reaching multi-year lows.Segments in DetailWithin segments, Neogen registered Food Safety revenues of $166.3 million in the fiscal first quarter, marking a stupendous 157.2% improvement from $64.6 million in the prior-year period, led by 4.5% core growth and 150.7% growth from acquisitions. The reported figure also exceeded our model’s segmental projection of $150.1 million for the first quarter.Core growth within this segment was led by the Bacterial &amp; General Sanitation product category, which benefited from new microbiological testing business in the United States and the United Kingdom and solid growth in the Natural Toxins and Allergens product category.Revenues from Animal Safety were $62.7 million, down 7.4% year over year. Within the segment, the core revenue decline of 6.7% was due to the Veterinary Instruments and Disposables product category, which experienced continued destocking by large veterinary distributors, and the Animal Care and Other product category, which had lower sales of small-animal supplements and vitamin injectables, due in part to supply constraints. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the Rodent Control, Insect Control and Cleaners and Disinfectants product categories. The reported figure missed our model’s segmental projection of $82 million for the first quarter.Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNeogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNeogen Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Neogen Corporation QuoteStory continuesThe company's worldwide genomics business declined modestly in the quarter as strength in sheep and beef testing in Australia and new business in beef markets in the United Kingdom and Brazil were offset by decreases in porcine and poultry testing due to two large domestic customer losses.Margin DetailsNeogen’s fiscal first-quarter gross profit increased 87.5% year over year to $116.8 million. The gross margin expanded 394 basis points (bps) to 50.9%. The increase was led by higher gross margins generated by incremental revenues from the former 3M Food Safety Division.Sales and marketing expenses rose 95.7% to $45.8 million, whereas administrative expenses rose 61.5% from the prior-year quarter to $45.1 million. R&amp;D expenses were $6.7 million, up 37.7% year over year. Operating costs totaled $97.6 million, up 73.7% from the last year’s quarter.The company reported an operating profit of $19.1 million for the quarter under review. The adjusted operating margin expanded 378 bps to 8.4%.Cash PositionNeogen exited the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash and investments of $178.8 million, compared with $163.2 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. At fiscal first-quarter end, the company’s non-current liabilities included a total outstanding debt of $900 million as well as committed borrowing headroom of $150 million.Full-Year GuidanceNeogen updated its outlook for fiscal 2024.The company continues to anticipate full-year revenues in the band of $955 million-$985 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $966.2 million.NEOG expects capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million, which includes approximately $100 million related specifically to the integration of the former 3M Food Safety Division (unchanged).Our TakeNeogen exited the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s legacy Food Safety business performed well, particularly in core product lines of allergen, natural toxin and microbiological testing. The Animal Safety business however, experienced continued destocking, with channel inventory levels reaching multi-year lows.Escalated operating costs were a concern.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksNeogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

The next generation WATCHMAN FLX is capturing the European market. Acquisitions, too are contributing to the topline. The increased 2023 guidance indicates that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 35.9% compared with the 0.2% fall of the industry and a 22.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $78.78 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 12.8% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13.8%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayGeographic Expansion Continues: Boston Scientific successfully expands operations across different geographies outside the United States. In 2022, 40% of the company’s consolidated revenues came from international regions.In the second quarter, EMEA sales grew 9% year over year on an operational basis, with double-digit growth in four of the company’s five major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, Boston Scientific saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including FARAPULSE, POLARx, ACURATE neo2 and LUX-DX. The company remains excited about the year ahead and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market.WATCHMAN, a Long-Term Growth Component: Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum, banking on the solid performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. WATCHMAN is the first device to offer a non-pharmacologic alternative to oral anti-coagulants that has been studied in a randomized clinical trial and is the leading device in percutaneous LAAC globally. The next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the second quarter of 2023, Boston Scientific noted that WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 27% year over year. The U.S. demand remained strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. Our estimate suggests an 8.3% improvement in the company's Watchman revenue in 2023.Upbeat Guidance: Boston Scientific’s full-year net sales growth is expected in the range of 10.5-11.5% on a reported basis (earlier estimate was 8.5-10.5% growth). Net sales growth is expected to be in the range of 10-11% on an organic basis (8-10%).Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $1.96 to $2.00 ($1.90 to $1.96). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.95, below the guidance.For the third quarter of 2023, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (an increase of 7-9% organically).Adjusted earnings are expected to be 46-48 cents per share.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Boston Scientific recording 40% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a significant dampener over the last few quarters, as with other important MedTech players.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.99 per share, indicating a 16.4% increase from the 2022 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $14.07 billion, suggesting a 10.9% rise from the 2022 figure.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

339,21b37434-76e0-3dd7-9b7f-8aec9a10253a,COF,2023-10-12,Is Capital One Financial (COF) a Good Pick for Value Investors?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-one-financial-cof-good-133000113.html,1697031000,STORY,"['COF', '^GSPC']","[Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Capital One Financial Corporation COF stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Capital One Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 7.55, as you can see in the chart below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&amp;P 500 stands at about 20.78. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Capital One Financial’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint (which is 7.70) over the past five years. Moreover, the current level stands well below the highs for the stock, suggesting that it can be a solid entry point.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 14.19. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe should also point out that Capital One Financial has a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 8.15, which is higher than the current level. So, it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Capital One Financial has a P/S ratio of about 0.84. This is a bit lower than the S&amp;P 500 average, which comes in at 3.71 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIf anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Capital One Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20%  of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Capital One Financial a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 3.54, which is far better than the industry average of 5.05. Clearly, COF is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Capital One Financial might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘D’ and a Momentum score of ‘A’. This gives COF a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘A’. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here &gt;&gt;)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been dismal at best. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen two up and two down in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 1.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched lower by 1.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action  for the stock in the chart below:Capital One Financial Corporation Price and ConsensusCapital One Financial Corporation Price and ConsensusCapital One Financial Corporation price-consensus-chart | Capital One Financial Corporation QuoteThis negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCapital One Financial is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 43% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence. However, over the past two years, the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

341,5153c8c5-e2bd-3441-bd6f-3a3a2e3274cc,KO,2023-10-12,Coca-Cola's (NYSE:KO) investors will be pleased with their respectable 38% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-colas-nyse-ko-investors-120026313.html,1697112026,STORY,['KO'],"[While The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 12% in the last quarter. But at least the stock is up over the last five years. Unfortunately its return of 18% is below the market return of 69%.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 35% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 3% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Coca-Cola's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Coca-Cola's TSR for the last 5 years was 38%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveCoca-Cola shareholders are down 0.9% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 20%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global alcohol industry, the most consumed liquor brands in the world, the largest alcohol company in the world, and the fastest growing alcohol category, and go directly to the 5 Most Consumed Alcohols in the World. Whether it’s Sunday brunch, Saturday night at the club, or Friday night with a few co-workers, the opportunities to take a drink are endless and engrained in the fabric of many facets of society. Alcohol’s frequent link with birthdays, sporting events, and other occasions has made it a mainstay in popular culture. From movies and TV shows to advertisements and social media, booze is frequently used as a symbol of celebration, relaxation, and socialization.The Global Alcohol Industry:In 2019, the global alcohol consumption, measured in liters of pure alcohol per person of 15 years of age or older, was 5.5 liters, which is a 4.7% relative decrease from 5.7 liters in 2010.  According to Allied Market Research, the global alcoholic beverages market size was valued at $1.62 trillion in 2021, and the market is projected to reach $2 trillion by 2031, with a CAGR of 2.2% during the forecast period. The market is likely to be driven by the increasing global young-adult demographic, coupled with high disposable income and consumer demand for premium/super-premium products. Globally, beer drives the market for alcoholic beverages. Regionally, North America and Asia-Pacific are expected to dominate the market during the forecast period.Most Consumed Liquor Brand in the World: With 100.9 million 9-liter cases sold worldwide in 2022, Jinro Soju is the Most Popular Spirit Brand in the World. There are many reasons why Jinro Soju is so popular. One is that it is a very versatile drink. It can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or mixed with other beverages. It is also very affordable, which makes it a popular choice for the price-conscious consumers. Additionally, the taste of Jinro Soju is very smooth and refreshing, making it the go-to drink for many people.Story continuesIn 2022, HiteJinro's revenue from soju sales amounted to approximately $1.13 billion and made up the largest share of its sales revenue.Largest Alcohol Company in the World: With total sales of $57.79 billion last year, Anheuser-Busch InBev Sa/NV (NYSE:BUD) is the Largest Alcohol Company in the World in 2023. The beer behemoth had a global production volume of 595 million hectoliters, or over 25% of the global beer production in 2022.The company has been facing some headwinds in the American market after the recent controversy regarding its best-selling brand Bud Light, which resulted in the iconic brand losing its crown as America’s Best-Selling Beer after nearly two decades. However, as we mentioned in our article – 17 Countries with the Highest Percentage of Non-Drinkers – billionaire Bill Gates’ portfolio managers decided to initiate a $96 million position in the firm during the second quarter. Broyhill Asset Management said the following about Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“The largest detractors to performance over the quarter were First Horizon Corp (FHN), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (NYSE:BUD), and Bayer (BAYRY). Problems at Anheuser Busch InBev began on April 1 with Dylan Mulvaney’s social media post, which ignited a fiery backlash amongst Bud Light customers across ‘Merica. With volumes down sharply, and competitors gaining share at BUD’s expense, operational deleveraging is set to weigh heavily on US margins amid peak demand pressure in the second quarter. Despite severe US headwinds (second-quarter operating profit maybe half of last year’s levels), we still expect BUD to grow consolidated operating profit at a mid-single-digit rate for the full year. With current issues well understood and investor sentiment in the gutters, we see significant upside in a stock, which is approaching a double-digit FCF yield. With FX headwinds and rising input costs reversing course, increasing margins are likely to drive positive surprises into FY24 as continued deleveraging accrues more value to shareholders.”Fastest Growing Alcohol Category: Ready-to-drink beverages continue to make headlines as the fastest-growing alcohol beverage category. While malt-based RTDs still retain a 91% share by volume in the American RTD market, spirit-based RTDs grew by 51% in 2021, approximately double the growth of the wine-and malt-based categories. As we mentioned in our article – 12 Best Alcohol Stocks to Own According to Hedge Funds –  the spirits-based RTDs are expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% in volume in the U.S. by 2025. A great example of a spirit-based RTD is the good ol’ Jack &amp; Coke. Although the beloved cocktail has been a quintessential serve at every bar for a long time, it is now also available in the form of a pre-mixed, canned RTD – courtesy of a joint venture between the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO). Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD made its U.S. debut in March this year in 12-oz. cans (7% ABV), and Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar also became available in May. Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) took a test-and learn-approach for the initial launch, applying lessons from a single-country rollout in Mexico to a global scaling strategy, bringing the product to 13 countries in 12 months. Stocks of Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) were held by 30 hedge funds at the end of Q2 in the Insider Monkey database, with Fundsmith LLP holding the largest stake of over 12.19 million shares, valued at $814.41 million. Both the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) rank among the Largest Beverage Companies in the World in 2023. With that said, here are the Most Popular Alcoholic Beverages in the World. 20 Most Consumed Alcohols in the WorldPhoto by Adam Wilson on UnsplashMethodology: Data on consumption itself is not available.

We ranked the following alcoholic beverages by the total size of their respective global markets in 2022. 20. MeadGlobal Market Size in 2022: $432.4 millionPossibly the ancestor of all alcoholic beverages, mead has enjoyed audiences across history. And while its popularity waned in recent centuries, the modern era has seen a resurgence in this ancient, golden-hued drink.

PiscoGlobal Market Size in 2022: $730.8 millionPisco is a South American brandy distilled from fermented grape juice using specific grape varietals. It has been produced exclusively in Peru and Chile for centuries. Both countries lay claim to pisco's origins and adhere to regulations that produce distinct styles. 18. ArakGlobal Market Size in 2022: $1.3 billionArak is made by extracting anise seeds in grape brandy and is considered by many to be one of the first flavored spirits ever made. A new generation of boutique distilleries is hoping to bring the classic Middle Eastern drink to fresh audiences and to celebrate arak’s heritage with World Arak Day, which was celebrated on June 27th this year, for the first time ever.17. OuzoGlobal Market Size in 2022: $1.58 billionOuzo is a Greek drink made from wine-making grape remains distilled into a kind of grappa. This grappa is given an anise flavor in a second heating and the resulting drink is sweet and silky, with an alcohol percentage of around 40%. Ouzo has consistently been the primary export of the Greek distilling industry, comprising 61% of the total value and 70% of the total quantity of Greek spirits exported in 2022. 16. CachaçaGlobal Market Size in 2022: $3.07 billionMade from fresh sugarcane juice which is fermented and distilled, cachaça gets its aroma and flavor from the Brazilian woods it's stored in. Brazil’s national drink shows up in spicy-sweet sips all over the world, but it's best-known as the main ingredient in a Caipirinha cocktail. Caipirinha is a great choice if you’re looking for the Best Alcoholic Drinks that Don’t Taste Like Alcohol. 15. SojuGlobal Market Size in 2022: $3.17 billionSoju is often called the Korean vodka, since it's smooth, mild, and mostly neutral, but it clocks in at about half the alcohol content. Exports of South Korea’s traditional liquor witnessed a 13.2% YoY increase in 2022 and reached $93.3 million. Soju is one of the Most Consumed Alcoholic Drinks. 14. ShochuGlobal Market Size in 2022: $6.73 billionShochu is Japan’s indigenous distilled spirit and has been around for about 500 years. It is most predominately made in Japan’s southern regions of Okinawa and Kyushu, where it was first developed.

SakeGlobal Market Size in 2022: $8.81 billionSake is a Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. It consists of four ingredients – rice, water, yeast, and a mold called koji. China is the largest importer of sake in the world, followed by the U.S., and Taiwan. The growth in China can be attributed to the continuous growth in the popularity of sake among younger generations and the upper class as a ‘high-end’ alcoholic beverage.12. Cognac and BrandyGlobal Market Size in 2022: $12.1 billionProduced from white grapes grown across the Charente and Charente-Maritime departments of western France, cognac is a protected category of brandy that must meet the requirements of the AOC in order to bear the region’s name on its label.The global volumes of cognac dropped by 4.8% in 2022 to 212.5 million bottles, as the world grappled with rising inflation, an energy crisis, and the aftershocks of the pandemic, with China still facing lockdown restrictions late into the year.11. Hard SeltzerGlobal Market Size in 2022: $14.39 billionWhether it's television and YouTube commercials or social media posts, it's hard to escape the latest alcoholic beverage craze – hard seltzer. This popular alcoholic drink combines alcohol with flavored carbonated water. Compared to many other alcoholic drinks, hard seltzer is lower in alcohol content, calories, and sugar. White Claw is the most popular hard seltzer brand in the world, with 59 million 9-liter cases sold in 2022. 10. TequilaGlobal Market Size in 2022: $14.7 billionTequila's popularity has been on the rise in the United States for years, and in 2021 it surpassed whiskey in retail sales, making it the second best-selling spirit behind vodka.

GinGlobal Market Size in 2022: $15.3 billionWe can think of three main reasons for gin's popularity - taste, versatility, and the sheer variety of gins.

According to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) data, gin exports from the U.K. hit $879 million last year, up from $651 million in 2021. Here are the Most Popular Gin Brands in 2023. Gin is counted among the Top 10 Most Consumed Alcohols in the World. 8. RumGlobal Market Size in 2022: $17.4 billionConsumer perception of the rum category has evolved in recent years. While rum sales are still dominated by major producers, consumer preferences are shifting away from value options and towards an appreciation for craft and aged rums. Made from fermented sugar cane juice, rum also provides a key function in cocktail culture.Many of the Best Rums in the World are made in the Caribbean.7. CiderGlobal Market Size in 2022: $17.9 billionNow, it seems like every season is cider season, as the beverage has risen in popularity significantly over the last decade. Cider is a popular alcoholic beverage category and the U.K. off-trade value sales growth of 5.2% over the past year backs this up. Some 47.8% of all U.K. households now regularly buy cider – up from 45.5% last year.6. VodkaGlobal Market Size in 2022: $25.98 billionVodka is the most consumed liquor in the United States - and has been since 1970.

(NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have bubbled to the top as two of the biggest brands globally. Their storied rivalry has played out in television commercials, celebrity endorsements and even in blind taste tests. But away from the froth of advertising campaigns and pop culture, another contest brews, one that intrigues investors: Which of these soda giants is the better buy?Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOHistorically, market watchers and investors have oscillated between these two stocks, gauging them based on factors that extend beyond taste. As Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), a significant stakeholder in Coca-Cola, aptly put it: ""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."" So which of these companies offers the most value to its shareholders?In this analysis, I will dive deep into their financials, growth strategies and market valuations in an attempt to uncap the mystery. Is Coca-Cola truly the more attractively valued stock with better growth prospects as some suggest? Or does Pepsi have some fizz left to surprise its investors?Second-quarter earnings showdownDiving right in, let's unpack the second-quarter earnings of the two beverage giants. These companies, with their rich histories and vast product portfolios, frequently butt heads in the market. And, as with any clash of titans, one emerged with a slight edge this quarter.Both companies have undoubtedly had their moments of triumph. PepsiCo, for instance, showcased impressive financial muscle, reporting revenue of $22.32 billion, comfortably surpassing the projections of $21.73 billion. Coca-Cola was not far behind, registering adjusted revenue of $11.97 billion, which exceeded expectations of $11.75 billion.PepsiCos challenges arose from its decision to increase product prices, which contributed to a 3% volume drop in food divisions and a 1% dip in beverages. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola navigated its own challenges, with a mere 1% decline in U.S. volume. Still, both giants showcased commendable resilience in their strategies. PepsiCo's CEO, Ramon Laguarta, highlighted the company's agility in a dynamic global environment. Conversely, Coca-Col CEO James Quincey acknowledged shifts in consumer preferences, particularly toward cheaper alternatives, yet remained cautiously optimistic.Story continuesWhen the dust settles and we are pressed to define a ""winner"" for the quarter, PepsiCo might just have the edge, chiefly due to its robust financial performance and slightly more optimistic full-year outlook. PepsiCo has adjusted its forecast to 10% organic revenue growth, up from a prior 8%. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, though certainly holding its own with revised expectations of 5% to 6% growth in adjusted earnings per share and an 8% to 9% increase in organic revenue, did not quite match PepsiCo's fervor.The future strategies of both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, especially around pricing, will be crucial determinants in the coming quarters.Financial overviewCoca-Cola's financial framework in 2023 reflects a robust and resilient company. The Atlanta-based behemoths financial strength rating stands at 6 out of 10. Key metrics reveal a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.38 and a debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 2.72, underscoring its aptitude in managing financial leverage while ensuring liquidity. The equity-to-asset ratio is pegged at 0.26, while the Piotroski F-Score is a strong 8 out of 9, showcasing the companys financial health. The Altman Z-Score of 3.91 places Coca-Cola in the safe zone, further alleviating concerns over financial distress.On the profitability side, Coca-Cola boasts a gross margin of 58.52%, translating to a net margin of 23.81%. The brand's power shines through its ability to maintain a return on equity of 43.38% and an impressive return on invested capital of 13.72%. Consistent with its historical performance, Coca-Cola has remained profitable for the past decade. The growth department reveals a three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% and a future three to five-year total revenue growth rate of 5.35%.Valuation-wise, Coca-Cola's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 21.50 with a forward price-to-earnings of 18.46. The company's GF Value is estimated at $67.50, suggesting a modest undervaluation. Coca-Cola continues to reward its shareholders with a healthy dividend yield of 3.48% and has a payout ratio of 0.75.Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo: A Financial Showdown Reveals the King of Carbonated EfficiencyPepsiCo has a financial strength rating of 5 out of 10. The company's cash-to-debt ratio is lower at 0.15, while its debt-to-equity ratio stands higher at 2.47. However, the company also has a reassuring Altman Z-Score of 3.95. In the profitability arena, it reveals a gross margin of 53.58%, culminating in a net margin of 8.76%. The company's return on equity is slightly higher at 44.18%. It also has a return on invested capital of 12.82%.The company's growth has outpaced Coca-Cola in the past three years with a revenue growth rate of 9.3%. Its future three to five-year total revenue growth rate is projected to be 5.63%.As for valuation, PepsiCo's price-earnings ratio is higher at 27.92 with a forward price-earnings ratio of 19.66. Its GF Value stands at $192.64, indicating a modest undervaluation. Shareholders of Pepsi enjoy a dividend yield of 3.02% with a slightly higher payout ratio of 0.83.Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo: A Financial Showdown Reveals the King of Carbonated EfficiencyBoth companies remain solid in their financial performance, but Coca-Cola is leading in profitability margins and liquidity, while PepsiCo has had faster near-term growth.Cash flow dynamicsWhen we delve deep into the financial tapestry of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, a fascinating narrative emerges. Coca-Cola, with its free cash flow for December 2022 standing at a robust $9.53 billion, seems to be enjoying a comfortable position. A quick calculation reveals that an impressive 22.17% of its revenue is converted into free cash flow for the said year. This, in the grand scheme of things, paints a picture of efficiency and possibly a commanding brand presence that ensures consistent cash inflows.Contrast this with PepsiCo, which recorded $5.60 billion in free cash flow for December 2022. Yet, when this figure is juxtaposed against the company's revenue, a mere 6.48% conversion emerges. It is a stark difference, especially when you consider that, in absolute terms, Pepsi's revenue dwarfs that of Coca-Cola. What this suggests is that while Pepsi might be raking in more money, its ability to transform that revenue into free cash flow, essentially the lifeblood of any business, is markedly lower than Coca-Cola's.Now, let's talk capital expenditure, a realm that often provides insight into a company's future ambitions. The data at hand does not spell out capital expenditure figures, but we can draw some inferences from the Ebitda and Ebitd values. If we consider the difference between these numbers as a proxy for depreciation and amortization (a reflection of past capital expenditures), Pepsi's figure overshadows Coca-Cola's. While it is not a direct measure, this could hint at Pepsi historically shelling out more in capital expenditures.Pepsi, with its sprawling revenue base, paints a more complex picture. Its conversion to free cash flow is notably more conservative than Coca-Cola's. Coupled with potentially heavier capital expenditures, it gives an impression of a brand investing aggressively to sustain or expand its operations.While revenue figures and growth rates provide a foundational understanding, it is the cash flow narrative that often reveals the true financial vitality of a company. In this scenario, Coca-Cola seems to be operating with a surgical efficiency, whereas Pepsi appears to be in the throes of aggressive expansion and investment.We have a winnerIn the arena of carbonated beverages, the financial bout between Coca-Cola and Pepsi has long been the subject of investors' scrutiny. Delving into the presented data, Coca-Cola shows superior prowess in its efficient conversion of revenue into free cash flow, a critical indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. As Buffett once said, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" In this context, Coca-Cola's financial metrics paint the picture of a more ""wonderful"" company from a cash flow standpoint.On the other hand, PepsiCo, while boasting higher revenue, trails in converting it into tangible free cash. This suggests a potentially aggressive expansion strategy, but at the cost of immediate cash efficiency. Peter Lynch's adage, ""Know what you own, and know why you own it,"" becomes pertinent here. PepsiCo's broader strategy may appeal to some, but its financial efficiency, as of the current data, seems to lag behind Coca-Cola's.In summary, after scrutinizing the financial indicators and overarching narratives, Coca-Cola emerges superior in this head-to-head analysis. While both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are commendable entities that I would be keen to invest in at a favorable price, they both stay on my radar for potential acquisition during market dips. From a branding and operational perspective, Coca-Cola takes the lead between the two.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are each down about 1% over the same time span.Blame the proliferation of injectable weight loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy potentially stunting demand for food. Formally known as GLP-1 drugs, Wall Street has latched onto this world-is-ending thesis for these large-cap dividend dandies.""Although only around 1% of U.S. adults have current prescriptions for Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, the recent acceleration in demand for these drugs for weight loss is raising profound questions about what this could mean for the future of healthcare and food and beverage consumption,"" pointed out veteran Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard in an exhaustive new piece of research this week.To be sure, the base for this acceleration in obesity drug users has been established — hence the uproar in the markets for these often savory stocks.Data from IMS/IQVIA suggests around 10.6 million shots of obesity drug doses were officially sanctioned by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the US in May 2023, Howard noted in her research.Dividing this figure by 4.5 weeks in a month suggests that the user base was around 2.4 million adults in May, Howard said. That equates to 0.8% of the total US population and around 0.9% of the US adult population on the injectables.Obesity drug usage is on a steady climb. (Bernstein)While understandable on the surface, one could label the furor in these supermarket stocks as unusual. And by extension, the sell-off may be overdone, and investors could be wise in getting out a shopping list of possible buys.Consider what there is to like from a fundamental basis.First, these are household name stocks that historically produce steady sales, earnings, and cash flow due to their leadership positions in products such as frozen food and soda. Investors have long enjoyed their consistency, even if growth rates have never been super hot (outside of the pandemic when demand for packaged food went bonkers).Story continuesThere is nothing to indicate — at least for now — that Big Food is going to lose this financial consistency because of weight loss drug injections gaining steam.""We can't detect any impact on our numbers right now,"" PepsiCo vice chairman and CFO Hugh Johnston told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We just don't see any impact at all.""The comments came on the back of another better-than-expected quarter from the producer of soda and Frito-Lay snacks.The usually cautious PepsiCo management team also struck a bullish tone on its initial 2024 outlook. That's despite conceivably more of the US population using obesity drugs next year.The CEO of Modelo and Corona maker Constellation Brands (STZ) was more blunt on the topic.""We do a lot of consumer research,"" Bill Newlands said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""We've never had a consumer bring that topic up [buying less beer because of weight loss drugs] with us.""Howard's own research hints that the longer-term outlook for Big Food remains intact.""At present, it appears that the overall impact on calories consumed is likely to be fairly muted,"" Howard explained. ""If over the next 5 years, the percentage of U.S. adults using these drugs for the long term scales to 10%, we would see only a 2.5% reduction in calories consumed over this timeframe, for an annual headwind of around 0.5% per year. Of course, this could be higher if tolerability and willingness to trial these drugs scales up meaningfully further and faster than this.""Pepsi mini sodas are displayed on shelves at a Walmart Supercenter on Dec. 6, 2022 in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images) (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)Meanwhile, the sell-off in food stocks has pushed up their dividend yields and pushed down valuations closer to historical lows.The aforementioned names are all currently sporting meaty dividend yields above 3%, with Conagra Brands offering a more salivating 5.3%.And then in times of geopolitical stress — as is currently the case — it's still valid to view the names as safe harbors in the storm that typically erupts in broader markets. People still need to eat, and the likes of PepsiCo are there to serve them and keep its cash flow-generating machine humming.All in all, there is a lot to view favorably.Some on the Street do acknowledge that food stocks could be ""value traps"" here: seemingly attractive picks valuation-wise, but ones that could get cheaper as fundamentals weaken (thanks, in this case, to obesity drugs).But the reality is the large food companies have proven their resilience over many decades of new healthier lifestyle trends. Ingredients in packaged food have evolved — think quinoa in a frozen dinner instead of starchier white rice, or a stevia-based flavored seltzer instead of full-sugar cola.Best believe these mammoth food companies will adapt and overcome.

These data were presented today in a late-breaking oral presentation (Abstract #6479; Session: D1T01.1I: Late Breaking News) at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2023, held from October 11-14 in Berlin.""We are excited by the TRuE-V LTE study data presented today during a late-breaking session at EADV. These long-term data highlight encouraging updates for an important sub-group of patients with nonsegmental vitiligo, those who initially showed limited or no response to treatment,"" said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation &amp; AutoImmunity, Incyte. ""The pooled analysis builds on the positive LTE data previously presented at the 2023 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting earlier this year and underscores the long-term potential of this treatment for people with vitiligo who are seeking repigmentation.""The analysis assessed participants initially randomized to apply Opzelura twice-daily (BID) from the TRuE-V1 and TRuE-V2 studies who had &lt;25% improvement from baseline in facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) or total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at Week 24 and had non-missing VASI assessments at the evaluated time points.Story continuesKey findings from the pooled analysis include:More than half of patients (54.9%) who initially experienced limited or no facial repigmentation at Week 24 achieved ≥75% improvement in facial repigmentation from baseline (F-VASI75) with continued treatment with Opzelura at Week 104.For patients with no initial facial repigmentation at Week 24, improvements in F-VASI were observed in 77.8% (49/63) and 97.1% (34/35) of patients at Weeks 52 and 104, respectively.For patients with limited facial repigmentation at Week 24, F-VASI improvements were observed in 64.0% (32/50) and 83.3% (30/36) of patients at Weeks 52 and 104, respectively.Half of the patients (50.0%) who initially experienced limited or no body repigmentation at Week 24 achieved ≥50% improvement in body repigmentation from baseline (T-VASI50) with continued treatment with Opzelura at Week 104.Among patients with no body repigmentation at Week 24, T-VASI improvements were observed in 79.6% (39/49) and 93.3% (28/30) of patients at Weeks 52 and 104, respectively.Among patients with limited body repigmentation at Week 24, T-VASI improvements were observed in 64.5% (80/124) and 81.6% (62/76) of patients at Weeks 52 and 104, respectively.Opzelura was well-tolerated – no serious treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) occurred among patients using Opzelura from Day 1; 6.3% (n=14/224) of these patients experienced ≥1 treatment-related TEAE. Application site pruritus was the only TEAE that occurred in &gt;1 patient (n=2; 0.9%).Opzelura is indicated for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or cyclosporine is not recommended.""With this analysis, we were able to more closely examine the impact of continued treatment with Opzelura in patients who showed limited to no improvements in facial or total body repigmentation following an initial six-month course of treatment,"" said Dr. Albert Wolkerstorfer, Netherlands Institute for Pigment Disorders, Department of Dermatology, University of Amsterdam. ""These data highlight the importance of continuing treatment with Opzelura in patients with vitiligo, even when minimal or no repigmentation is achieved after six months of treatment.""Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by depigmentation of skin that results from the loss of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Overactivity of the JAK signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of vitiligo. In the United States, more than 1.5 million people are diagnosed with vitiligo1. The overall prevalence of the condition is estimated to be approximately 2-3 million2, with the majority of patients (approximately 85%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo3. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 304.More information regarding the EADV Congress 2023 can be found at https://eadvcongress2023.org/.About TRuE-VThe TRuE-V clinical trial program includes two Phase 3 studies, TRuE-V1 (NCT04052425) and TRuE-V2 (NCT04057573), evaluating the safety and efficacy of Opzelura in patients with vitiligo. Each study enrolled approximately 300 patients (age ≥12 years) who have been diagnosed with nonsegmental vitiligo.About Opzelura® (ruxolitinib) Cream 1.5%Opzelura, a novel cream formulation of Incyte’s selective JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration for the topical treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, is the first and only treatment for repigmentation approved for use in the United States. Opzelura is also approved in the U.S. for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies, or when those therapies are not advisable. Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.In Europe, Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream 15mg/g is approved for the treatment of non-segmental vitiligo with facial involvement in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura.Opzelura is a registered trademark of Incyte.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONSERIOUS INFECTIONSPatients treated with oral Janus kinase inhibitors for inflammatory conditions are at risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death. Reported infections include:Active tuberculosis, which may present with pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease.Invasive fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and pneumocystosis.Bacterial, viral, including herpes zoster, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens.Avoid use of OPZELURA in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. If a serious infection develops, interrupt OPZELURA until the infection is controlled. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of treatment prior to initiating OPZELURA in patients with chronic or recurrent infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with OPZELURA.Serious lower respiratory tract infections were reported in the clinical development program with topical ruxolitinib.No cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported in clinical trials with OPZELURA. Cases of active TB were reported in clinical trials of oral Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Consider evaluating patients for latent and active TB infection prior to administration of OPZELURA. During OPZELURA use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB.Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical trials with Janus kinase inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions including OPZELURA. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting OPZELURA treatment until the episode resolves.Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases, with or without associated elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections taking oral ruxolitinib. OPZELURA initiation is not recommended in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.MORTALITYIn a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor comparing an oral JAK inhibitor to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker treatment, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed with the JAK inhibitor. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA.MALIGNANCIESMalignancies were reported in patients treated with OPZELURA. Lymphoma and other malignancies have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In RA patients treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancers), patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers.Non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, have occurred in patients treated with OPZELURA. Perform periodic skin examinations during OPZELURA treatment and following treatment as appropriate. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen.MAJOR ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS (MACE)In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke), was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients who have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OPZELURA, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OPZELURA in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.THROMBOSISThromboembolic events were observed in trials with OPZELURA. Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with an oral JAK inhibitor, a higher rate of thrombosis was observed when compared with TNF blockers. Avoid OPZELURA in patients at risk. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue OPZELURA and treat appropriately.Thrombocytopenia, Anemia, and NeutropeniaThrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in the clinical trials with OPZELURA. Consider the benefits and risks for individual patients who have a known history of these events prior to initiating therapy with OPZELURA. Perform CBC monitoring as clinically indicated. If signs and/or symptoms of clinically significant thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occur, patients should discontinue OPZELURA.Lipid ElevationsTreatment with oral ruxolitinib has been associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides.Adverse ReactionsIn nonsegmental vitiligo, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥1%) are application site acne (6%), application site pruritus (5%), nasopharyngitis (4%), headache (4%), urinary tract infection (2%), application site erythema (2%), and pyrexia (1%).PregnancyThere is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in pregnant persons exposed to OPZELURA during pregnancy. Pregnant persons exposed to OPZELURA and healthcare providers should report OPZELURA exposure by calling 1-855-463-3463.LactationAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with OPZELURA and for approximately four weeks after the last dose (approximately 5-6 elimination half-lives).Please see Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning, and Medication Guide for OPZELURA.About Incyte DermatologyIncyte’s science-first approach and expertise in immunology has formed the foundation of the company.

Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, is not recommended.Incyte has worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of ruxolitinib cream, marketed in the United States as Opzelura. In April 2022, Incyte entered into a strategic alliance agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. for the development, manufacturing and exclusive commercialization of ruxolitinib cream for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory dermatology indications in Japan.Opzelura is a registered trademark of Incyte.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONOPZELURA is for use on the skin only. Do not use OPZELURA in your eyes, mouth, or vagina.OPZELURA may cause serious side effects, including:Serious Infections: OPZELURA contains ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib belongs to a class of medicines called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors are medicines that affect your immune system. JAK inhibitors can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people have had serious infections while taking JAK inhibitors by mouth, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have been hospitalized or died from these infections. Some people have had serious infections of their lungs while taking OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider should watch you closely for signs and symptoms of TB during treatment with OPZELURA.OPZELURA should not be used in people with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. You should not start using OPZELURA if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay. You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles (herpes zoster) while using OPZELURA.Increased risk of death due to any reason (all causes): Increased risk of death has happened in people 50 years of age and older who have at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and are taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth.Cancer and immune system problems: OPZELURA may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers have happened in people taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth. People taking JAK inhibitors by mouth have a higher risk of certain cancers including lymphoma and lung cancer, especially if they are a current or past smoker. Some people have had skin cancers while using OPZELURA. Your healthcare provider will regularly check your skin during your treatment with OPZELURA. Limit the amount of time you spend in the sunlight. Wear protective clothing when you are in the sun and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen.Increased risk of major cardiovascular events: Increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death have happened in people 50 years of age and older who have at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor and taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth, especially in current or past smokers.Blood clots: Blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) or lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) can happen in some people taking OPZELURA. This may be life-threatening. Blood clots in the vein of the legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT) and lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE) have happened more often in people who are 50 years of age and older and with at least 1 heart disease (cardiovascular) risk factor taking a medicine in the class of medicines called JAK inhibitors by mouth.Low blood cell counts: OPZELURA may cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), low red blood cell counts (anemia), and low white blood cell counts (neutropenia). If needed, your healthcare provider will do a blood test to check your blood cell counts during your treatment with OPZELURA and may stop your treatment if signs or symptoms of low blood cell counts happen.Cholesterol increases: Cholesterol increase has happened in people when ruxolitinib is taken by mouth. Tell your healthcare provider if you have high cholesterol or triglycerides.Before starting OPZELURA, tell your healthcare provider if you:have an infection, are being treated for one, or have had an infection that does not go away or keeps coming backhave diabetes, chronic lung disease, HIV, or a weak immune systemhave TB or have been in close contact with someone with TBhave had shingles (herpes zoster)have or have had hepatitis B or Clive, have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections. These infections may happen or become more severe if you use OPZELURA. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common.think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection such as: fever, sweating, or chills, muscle aches, cough or shortness of breath, blood in your phlegm, weight loss, warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body, diarrhea or stomach pain, burning when you urinate or urinating more often than usual, feeling very tiredhave ever had any type of cancer, or are a current or past smokerhave had a heart attack, other heart problems, or a strokehave had blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs in the pasthave high cholesterol or triglycerideshave or have had low white or red blood cell countsare pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

Results showed that treatment with oral povorcitinib was associated with substantial total body and facial repigmentation across all treatment groups at Week 52. These data were presented today in a late-breaking oral presentation (Abstract #6749 Session: D1T01.1A – Late-Breaking News) at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2023, held from October 11-14 in Berlin.Specifically, these results, which build on the previously announced data, showed:Mean percentage total body depigmentation improvement from baseline as measured by the Total Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at Week 52 for povorcitinib 15-to-75 mg, 45 mg, 75 mg and placebo-to-75 mg were 40.7%, 42.7%, 41.3% and 18.1%, respectively.Mean percentage facial depigmentation improvement from baseline as measured by the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI) at Week 52 for povorcitinib 15-to-75 mg, 45 mg, 75 mg and placebo-to-75 mg were 63.6%, 63.8%, 64.4% and 54.8%, respectively.""These 52-week results further support earlier data and reinforce the efficacy profile and potential of povorcitinib as an oral treatment for patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo,"" said Kurt Brown, M.D., Vice President and Povorcitinib Global Program Head, Incyte. ""At Incyte, we are deeply committed to addressing unmet needs in the vitiligo community and understanding how this disease can affect patients’ lives. Today’s data highlight exciting progress as we work to bring new potential treatment options to patients living with this immune-mediated skin condition.""Story continuesKey secondary endpoint findings include:More on-treatment patients achieved ≥50% reduction from baseline in T-VASI (T-VASI50) at Week 52 compared to initial findings at Week 24 (povorcitinib 15-to-75 mg arm, 45.2%; 45 mg arm, 37.0%; 75 mg arm, 37.9%; placebo-to-75 mg arm, 15.2%).More on-treatment patients achieved ≥50% and &gt;75% reduction from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI50 and F-VASI75, respectively) at Week 52 compared to initial findings at Week 24 (povorcitinib 15-to-75 mg arm, 71.0% and 48.4%; 45 mg arm, 77.8% and 55.6%; 75 mg arm, 69.0% and 58.6%; placebo-to-75 mg arm, 63.6% and 45.5%, respectively).Povorcitinib was well tolerated at all doses. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade occurred in 89.2% of 83 patients who received 45 mg or 75 mg doses throughout the study period; the most common were COVID-19 (36.1%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (13.3%), acne (12.0%), fatigue (10.8%) and headache (9.6%).Among the 32 patients who completed the follow-up period through Week 76, total body and facial repigmentation was maintained, which suggests durability of response following treatment discontinuation. Sample size during post-treatment was small, limiting interpretation, and findings need to be confirmed in a larger population.""Vitiligo often has a significant impact on patients’ lives, and there is a need for new treatment options that can offer solutions to people with extensive disease who desire repigmentation,"" said Khaled Ezzedine, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Department of Dermatology, Henri Mondor Hospital and EpiDermE, Université Paris. ""Today’s results provide an encouraging update in support of a potential oral option to treat extensive nonsegmental vitiligo. It is exciting to see continued progress in this space that, until recently, had limited options for patients.""Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by depigmentation of skin that results from the loss of pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Overactivity of the JAK signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of vitiligo. In the United States, more than 1.5 million people are diagnosed with vitiligo1. The overall prevalence of the condition is estimated to be approximately 2-3 million2, with the majority of patients (approximately 85%) suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo3. Vitiligo can occur at any age, although many patients with vitiligo will experience initial onset before the age of 304.More information regarding the EADV Congress 2023 can be found at https://eadvcongress2023.org/.About the Phase 2b Study (NCT04818346)The Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study evaluated the efficacy and safety of povorcitinib (formerly INCB54707) in adult patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo.The study enrolled 171 patients (age 18 to 75 years) diagnosed with nonsegmental vitiligo affecting ≥8% of their body surface area and randomized them 1:1:1:1 to receive once-daily (QD) povorcitinib 15 mg (n=43), 45 mg (n=41), 75 mg (n=42), or placebo (n=42) for 24 weeks during the placebo-controlled period. Of the 171 randomized patients, 168 patients were treated as part of the 24-week placebo-controlled period. During the 28-week extension period (n=138), patients originally randomized to receive povorcitinib 45 mg QD continued with the same dose (n=32). Patients originally randomized to receive povorcitinib 15 mg QD, 75 mg QD or placebo each received 75 mg povorcitinib QD for the duration of the 28-week extension period (n=37, 34 and 35, respectively). Following the extension period was a 24-week follow-up period.The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in total body Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (T-VASI) at Week 24. The key secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving ≥50% reduction from baseline in the T-VASI (T-VASI50) at Week 24.Additional endpoints included the percentage of patients achieving ≥50% reduction from baseline in facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (F-VASI; F-VASI50), ≥75% reduction from baseline in F-VASI (F-VASI75) and T-VASI50 at each visit. Safety of povorcitinib was assessed by the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).For more information about this Phase 2b study, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04818346.About Povorcitinib (INCB54707)Povorcitinib (INCB54707) is an oral small-molecule JAK1 inhibitor currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for vitiligo, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), prurigo nodularis, chronic spontaneous urticaria and asthma.

The reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21.4%.Revenues for the fiscal first quarter increased 73% on a year-over-year basis to $228.9 million. Core revenues declined 1.3%. Acquisitions and discontinued product lines contributed 73.5%. The metric missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%. Per management, the Animal Safety business experienced continued destocking as anticipated, with channel inventory levels reaching multi-year lows.Segments in DetailWithin segments, Neogen registered Food Safety revenues of $166.3 million in the fiscal first quarter, marking a stupendous 157.2% improvement from $64.6 million in the prior-year period, led by 4.5% core growth and 150.7% growth from acquisitions. The reported figure also exceeded our model’s segmental projection of $150.1 million for the first quarter.Core growth within this segment was led by the Bacterial &amp; General Sanitation product category, which benefited from new microbiological testing business in the United States and the United Kingdom and solid growth in the Natural Toxins and Allergens product category.Revenues from Animal Safety were $62.7 million, down 7.4% year over year. Within the segment, the core revenue decline of 6.7% was due to the Veterinary Instruments and Disposables product category, which experienced continued destocking by large veterinary distributors, and the Animal Care and Other product category, which had lower sales of small-animal supplements and vitamin injectables, due in part to supply constraints. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the Rodent Control, Insect Control and Cleaners and Disinfectants product categories. The reported figure missed our model’s segmental projection of $82 million for the first quarter.Neogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNeogen Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNeogen Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Neogen Corporation QuoteStory continuesThe company's worldwide genomics business declined modestly in the quarter as strength in sheep and beef testing in Australia and new business in beef markets in the United Kingdom and Brazil were offset by decreases in porcine and poultry testing due to two large domestic customer losses.Margin DetailsNeogen’s fiscal first-quarter gross profit increased 87.5% year over year to $116.8 million. The gross margin expanded 394 basis points (bps) to 50.9%. The increase was led by higher gross margins generated by incremental revenues from the former 3M Food Safety Division.Sales and marketing expenses rose 95.7% to $45.8 million, whereas administrative expenses rose 61.5% from the prior-year quarter to $45.1 million. R&amp;D expenses were $6.7 million, up 37.7% year over year. Operating costs totaled $97.6 million, up 73.7% from the last year’s quarter.The company reported an operating profit of $19.1 million for the quarter under review. The adjusted operating margin expanded 378 bps to 8.4%.Cash PositionNeogen exited the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with cash and investments of $178.8 million, compared with $163.2 million at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023. At fiscal first-quarter end, the company’s non-current liabilities included a total outstanding debt of $900 million as well as committed borrowing headroom of $150 million.Full-Year GuidanceNeogen updated its outlook for fiscal 2024.The company continues to anticipate full-year revenues in the band of $955 million-$985 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $966.2 million.NEOG expects capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million, which includes approximately $100 million related specifically to the integration of the former 3M Food Safety Division (unchanged).Our TakeNeogen exited the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s legacy Food Safety business performed well, particularly in core product lines of allergen, natural toxin and microbiological testing. The Animal Safety business however, experienced continued destocking, with channel inventory levels reaching multi-year lows.Escalated operating costs were a concern.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksNeogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

One such stock that merits attention is DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA). The stock, which is currently priced at 76.3, recorded a loss of 16.41% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 25.76%. The stock's fair valuation is $128.54, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with DVA. Click here to check it out. DVA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DVAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method.

An In-Depth ExplorationUnpacking the Risks: DaVita's Low Altman Z-ScoreInvestors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with DaVita (NYSE:DVA) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.37. These indicators suggest that DaVita, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.A Snapshot of DaVita's OperationsDaVita is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, boasting a market share that eclipses 35% when measured by both patients and clinics. The firm operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, mostly in the U.S., and treats over 240,000 patients globally each year. However, despite its robust operations, its financial health may be in question, as reflected by its low Altman Z-score.Story continuesDaVita (DVA): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationBreaking Down DaVita's Financial HealthA dissection of DaVita's Altman Z-score reveals potential financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating DaVita's historical data, 2021: 0.08; 2022: 0.04; 2023: 0.03, we observe a declining trend in this ratio. This downward movement indicates DaVita's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.ConclusionWhile DaVita's stock may seem undervalued based on its GF Value, the company's low Altman Z-score and declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio suggest potential financial distress. These factors indicate that DaVita (NYSE:DVA) might be a potential value trap, underlining the importance of in-depth financial analysis before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The next generation WATCHMAN FLX is capturing the European market. Acquisitions, too are contributing to the topline. The increased 2023 guidance indicates that the company is well-poised to handle the industry-wise trend of currency headwinds and global inflationary pressure. However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 35.9% compared with the 0.2% fall of the industry and a 22.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $78.78 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 12.8% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13.8%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayGeographic Expansion Continues: Boston Scientific successfully expands operations across different geographies outside the United States. In 2022, 40% of the company’s consolidated revenues came from international regions.In the second quarter, EMEA sales grew 9% year over year on an operational basis, with double-digit growth in four of the company’s five major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, Boston Scientific saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including FARAPULSE, POLARx, ACURATE neo2 and LUX-DX. The company remains excited about the year ahead and expects to continue to outpace its peers within the EMEA market.WATCHMAN, a Long-Term Growth Component: Boston Scientific’s structural heart programs are fast building momentum, banking on the solid performance of the WATCHMAN left atrial appendage closure device. WATCHMAN is the first device to offer a non-pharmacologic alternative to oral anti-coagulants that has been studied in a randomized clinical trial and is the leading device in percutaneous LAAC globally. The next generation WATCHMAN FLX is strongly capturing the European market.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the second quarter of 2023, Boston Scientific noted that WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 27% year over year. The U.S. demand remained strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. Our estimate suggests an 8.3% improvement in the company's Watchman revenue in 2023.Upbeat Guidance: Boston Scientific’s full-year net sales growth is expected in the range of 10.5-11.5% on a reported basis (earlier estimate was 8.5-10.5% growth). Net sales growth is expected to be in the range of 10-11% on an organic basis (8-10%).Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $1.96 to $2.00 ($1.90 to $1.96). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.95, below the guidance.For the third quarter of 2023, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (an increase of 7-9% organically).Adjusted earnings are expected to be 46-48 cents per share.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Boston Scientific recording 40% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a significant dampener over the last few quarters, as with other important MedTech players.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.99 per share, indicating a 16.4% increase from the 2022 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $14.07 billion, suggesting a 10.9% rise from the 2022 figure.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

Technological advancements like 5G, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) have further driven industry expansion. Additionally, increased concerns about data security have acted as a catalyst for industry growth.Thomson Reuters Corp., Marvell Technology, Inc., Trane Technologies plc and Aptiv PLC are poised to gain from the prevailing trends of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Technology Services industry encompasses companies involved in producing, developing and designing various software support, data processing, computing hardware and communications equipment. These offerings range from integrated powertrain technologies, advanced analytics, technology solutions, and contract research services to semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies, collaboration software, specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems.This industry caters to consumer and business markets and serves diverse end markets and customer segments. Additionally, some industry players offer advanced analytics, clinical research services, data storage technology and solutions and technology-enabled financial services for consumers and small business owners.Factors Structuring the Future of Technology ServicesRising Demand Environment: The industry has been gaining traction over the past year, thanks to recent technological advancements and the onset of remote work. Revenues, income and cash flows have been growing in the past year, aiding many industry players to pay out stable dividends.Story continuesCloud Computing Gains Traction: Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market was valued at USD 483.98 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1% from 2023 to 2030. Factors driving this growth include the cloud's ability to enhance business performance, increasing demand for hybrid and Omni-cloud systems and pay-as-you-go models.Government efforts to safeguard data and the adoption of hybrid work models post the COVID-19 pandemic are also contributing.

These turbines will be installed in a new combined cycle power plant at the Zhoushan archipelago in Zhejiang Province, China.GE Vernova is the combined operations of GE Digital, Renewable Energy and GE Power. Its Gas Power business includes General Electric’s gas lifecycle business (including Power Services and Gas Power Systems businesses).Per the deal, GE will supply two units of 9HA.02 gas turbines to SDIC Zhoushan’s combined cycle plant, which is the first H-class gas-fired power generation project in Zhejiang Province. GE’s turbines can turn on or off quickly, which support the growth of renewables by switching to natural gas power when wind or solar energy isn’t accessible.The use of General Electric’s HA gas turbines can help reduce emissions by as much as 60%. With the help of these turbines, the plant can provide an equivalent capacity, which could be produced by burning 1.35 million tons of coal in a year.The gas turbines will also increase reliability and flexibility by boosting Zhejiang Province’s power-supply capacity and power grid peak shaving capability.When completed, this 1.7-Gigawatt power plant will help power China’s largest archipelago, which comprises 1,390 islands.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.Phillips 66 (PSX) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PSX is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value.Investors should also note that PSX holds a PEG ratio of 0.42. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PSX's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 0.86. Within the past year, PSX's PEG has been as high as 0.66 and as low as 0.30, with a median of 0.40.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PSX's P/B ratio of 1.59. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2. PSX's P/B has been as high as 1.78 and as low as 1.19, with a median of 1.43, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PSX has a P/S ratio of 0.31. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.35.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that PSX has a P/CF ratio of 3.94. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 4.87. Over the past 52 weeks, PSX's P/CF has been as high as 4.49 and as low as 2.99, with a median of 3.85.Investors could also keep in mind Valero Energy (VLO), an Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Valero Energy is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 6.94 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 1.16. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 7.44 and average PEG ratio of 0.86.Over the last 12 months, VLO's P/E has been as high as 8.76, as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.26, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.46, as low as 0.73, with a median of 1.04.Valero Energy sports a P/B ratio of 1.60 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2. In the past 52 weeks, VLO's P/B has been as high as 2.31, as low as 1.39, with a median of 1.83.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Phillips 66 and Valero Energy strong Value grade, but they help show that the stocks are likely undervalued right now.

373,e6bd9016-0c09-37e9-89c6-a147897f1049,VLO,2023-10-12,Buy 5 Stocks With High ROE as Bond Yields Subside Steadily,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-stocks-high-roe-120300995.html,1697025780,STORY,"['DDS', 'UPBD', 'AGNC', 'VLO', 'ON']","[Despite an initial setback triggered by the sudden outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the U.S. equity markets witnessed a steady uptrend over the past few trading sessions as bond yields subsided. As rising geopolitical tensions and volatility in oil prices forced investors to seek refuge in the less risky bond asset portfolio, bond prices surged while yields fell considerably, propelling the stocks higher.The uptrend was further buoyed by a solid September jobs report that portrayed a better-than-expected 336,000 job addition. While the unemployment rate was 3.8%, average hourly earnings were up 0.2% for the month and 4.2% from a year ago compared with respective estimates of 0.3% and 4.3%. This partially negated the rate hike fears as the Federal Reserve kept the road ajar for another hike before the end of the year.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. ON Semiconductor Corporation ON, Dillard's, Inc. DDS, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Upbound Group, Inc. UPBD and AGNC Investment Corp. AGNC are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screening:ON Semiconductor: Phoenix, AZ-based onsemi is an original equipment manufacturer of a broad range of discrete and embedded semiconductor components. The company has a very well-diversified business. onsemi generates a significant percentage of revenues from the computing, consumer, industrial, communications and automotive markets.The stock has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 7.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.7%, on average. onsemi carries a Zacks Rank #2.Dillard's: Founded in 1938, Dillard's is a large departmental store chain featuring fashion apparel and home furnishings.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So, when we ran our eye over UnitedHealth Group's (NYSE:UNH) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for UnitedHealth Group, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$30b ÷ (US$280b - US$113b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, UnitedHealth Group has an ROCE of 18%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.7% generated by the Healthcare industry. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group roceIn the above chart we have measured UnitedHealth Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for UnitedHealth Group.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 18% and the business has deployed 81% more capital into its operations. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that UnitedHealth Group has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesOn a separate but related note, it's important to know that UnitedHealth Group has a current liabilities to total assets ratio of 40%, which we'd consider pretty high. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, UnitedHealth Group has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 112% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for UnitedHealth Group   you'll probably want to know about.While UnitedHealth Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The Government business remains well-poised for growth.

However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially.The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too.

UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This largest U.S. health insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2.02%.For the most recent quarter, UnitedHealth was expected to post earnings of $5.92 per share, but it reported $6.14 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.72%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $6.24 per share, while it actually produced $6.26 per share, a surprise of 0.32%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for UnitedHealth. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UnitedHealth has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 13, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Given the company's substantial involvement in the healthcare sector, a sustained rise in membership is expected to have aided its quarterly performance. Growth in Community &amp; State as well as Employer &amp; Individual Domestic is expected to have supported the unit.UnitedHealthcare BusinessThrough this segment, UNH offers healthcare benefits around the world. While it has significant exposure to the Medicare and Medicaid markets, it also serves individuals and employers. The defensive properties of the sector enable UnitedHealth to maintain its momentum despite economic headwinds.In the last reported quarter, the segment’s revenues jumped 13.1% year over year to $70.2 billion, whereas operating income improved 13.2% to $4.4 billion.UnitedHealthcare's Q2 PerformanceConsidering the unit’s products, premiums increased 12.9% year over year to $67 billion in the second quarter, whereas service revenues rose 1.7% to $2.6 billion. Total revenues from Employer &amp; Individual Domestic, Medicare &amp; Retirement, and Community &amp; State businesses came in at $67.9 billion, increasing 13.4% year over year. Also, from global operations, UNH reported revenues of $2.3 billion, up 3.5% year over year.Forecast for Q3 Segment PerformanceThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s revenues indicates a 10.9% year-over-year increase from the year-ago level of $62 billion, whereas our estimate suggests an 8.4% rise. The consensus mark for third-quarter operating income signals a 6.2% year-over-year rise from $3.8 billion a year ago.With seniors resuming elective procedures that were delayed due to pandemic-related constraints, medical costs are expected to have increased in the third quarter. This is expected to have resulted in UNH having lower premiums remaining after settling payments. As such, the consensus mark for third-quarter 2023 medical care ratio is pegged at 82.82%, indicating an increase from the year-ago level of 81.60%, while our estimate of 82.70% suggests a lower jump.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2023 global revenues indicates an increase of 1.8% year over year from $2.1 billion while our estimate implies a 1.7% rise. The consensus mark for UnitedHealthcare’s Community &amp; State revenues suggests a 13.5% increase from the year-ago period’s $16.1 billion, whereas our model predicts a 13.2% gain.The consensus mark for Medicare &amp; Retirement business’ revenues suggests 14% year-over-year growth from $27.9 billion a year ago while our estimate indicates a 9.2% improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total number of people served in commercial domestic business indicates a 3.1% increase from the year-ago level of 26,555 thousand while our estimate implies a 2.8% rise.Final ThoughtsThe UnitedHealthcare unit is anticipated to have positioned the company for significant year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s third-quarter earnings of $6.33 per share signals a 9.3% increase from the prior-year figure of $5.79. The consensus estimate for revenues of $91.4 billion indicates a 13% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Nonetheless, it is probable that increased costs and expenses have impacted the profit margins in the third quarter, introducing uncertainty regarding the potential for surpassing earnings expectations. Our estimate for medical costs indicates a 10.5% year-over-year increase while we expect operating expenses to have jumped 7.4%. Further, we expect the cost of products sold to have jumped 11.5% year over year in the third quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around.

(ELC) (NYSE: EL) shared its latest clinical research findings in an invited keynote address and podium presentation at the 33rd International Federation of Societies of Cosmetic Chemists (IFSCC) Congress, held in Barcelona, Spain, in September. Nadine Pernodet, PhD, Senior Vice President, Bioscience, ELC, and Estée Lauder brand Lead Scientist, addressed innovation in the beauty industry in a lecture entitled, ""Harnessing Epigenetics: from Anti-Aging to Age Reversal."" Mei Yu, MD, PhD, Executive Director, Clinical Translation, Global Clinical &amp; Consumer Science, Global R&amp;D, ELC, presented a translational clinical study titled, ""Development and validation of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) model in multi-ethnicities using different induction methods.""Estee Lauder Companies (PRNewsfoto/The Estée Lauder Companies)As part of the keynote presentation, Dr. Pernodet highlighted ELC's research over the past 15 years and findings on how epigenetics—through the influence of external environment and lifestyle—directly impacts skin aging. She also explained that, with the right technologies, understanding the positive and negative epigenetic signals provides the ability to reverse skin aging. Data shared included from Dr. Pernodet's work on circadian rhythm, microRNAs, mechanobiology, and longevity proteins, exploring how the microenvironment and macroenvironment alter skin cell activities. This body of research is central to the ongoing development of approaches that enable innovations to shift from anti-aging to age reversal.""Fifteen years ago, we realized the impactful role epigenetics could play in skin aging, and it is now well-recognized in the scientific community that 75% of the aging process is directly related to epigenetics,"" said Dr. Pernodet. ""I'm honored to have been selected to present a keynote lecture at the IFSCC conference this year to share the latest in this groundbreaking science that is transforming the beauty industry. As the industry leader in this research, we remain committed to finding new opportunities to understand how our environment and lifestyles impact skin cells so we can move toward age reversal.""Story continuesA part of ELC's R&amp;D department, the Clinical Translation function is dedicated to generating new clinical insights and methodologies and developing breakthrough technologies in select areas to bridge fundamental scientific discoveries and actual clinical benefits. The Clinical Translation team expands the repertoire of in vivo testing protocols to measure consumer-relevant benefits and assess the effects of skin care formulations on those benefits. Consistent with ELC's commitment to diversity and inclusion in its product offerings, Dr. Yu's podium presentation emphasized the need to develop optimal protocols and methodologies to address ethnic differences. The study showed a reliable methodology to induce and evaluate the progression of PIH and to help develop treatment options for the resolution and prevention of PIH across multiple Fitzpatrick skin types. The team followed the time courses of inflammatory response and pigmentation for three different PIH induction methods in Caucasian, Asian, and African American study participants to identify the optimal induction methods to evaluate anti-hyperpigmentation technologies.""This work represents a significant advancement because it helps facilitate better understanding of the dynamic development and progression of PIH as well as post-inflammatory erythema (PIE), their underlying mechanisms, and their manifestations across skin phototypes and ethnicities,"" said Dr. Yu. ""Implementing this protocol will better enable the development of novel and fully inclusive treatment options for its resolution.""The work presented by ELC scientists at the 33rd IFSCC Congress reflects advances in ELC's core scientific platforms, including epigenetics, as well as our commitment to pursuing research that is inclusive of skin types and ethnicities from around the globe in order to develop methods, technologies, and products that meet the needs and desires of our diverse consumers.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ, McDonald's Corp. MCD and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Amazon is one of the most widely-recognized e-commerce giants, with the company also enjoying a dominant space in cloud computing thanks to AWS (Amazon Web Services).It's one of several stocks that have helped lead the market's surge in 2023, being classified as one of the 'Magnificent Seven.'Analysts have taken their earnings expectations higher across the board, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company resides within the Zacks Internet – Commerce industry, which is currently ranked in the top 26% of all Zacks industries. Roughly half of a stock's movement can be attributed to its group, helping to clarify the importance of targeting industries with favorable current standings.Aside from the favorable earnings outlook, let's take a closer look at a few other characteristics of Amazon.Current StandingAs mentioned previously, Amazon shares have been big-time performers in 2023, up more than 50% and widely outperforming the S&amp;P 500's impressive 14% YTD gain on the back of an improved operating environment and a strong consumer.The company's success in 2023 has been reflected by its quarterly performance, with Amazon exceeding Zacks Consensus EPS and revenue estimates in three consecutive quarters. In its latest print, the market titan delivered an 85% EPS beat and posted revenue 2% ahead of expectations.The heavyweight is scheduled to reveal its next set of quarterly results near late October. Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.58 suggests a 190% improvement from the year-ago quarter, with our $141.9 billion quarterly revenue estimate implying growth of 11.6% year-over-year.Story continuesThe revisions trend has been notably bullish for the quarter-to-be-reported, with the $0.58 per share consensus estimate up nearly 50% since July.In addition, it was recently revealed that Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an AI safety and research company based in San Francisco and a rival of OpenAI. We're all aware that AI is Wall Street's shiny new toy in 2023, constantly dominating headlines.The deal reflects a partnership to develop reliable and high-performing foundation models, with AWS now becoming Anthropic's primary cloud provider for critical workloads. Regarding AWS expectations for the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AWS Net Sales stands at $23.2 billion, 13% higher than the year-ago figure.The company has recently exceeded consensus expectations for AWS Net Sales in back-to-back releases.Bottom LineInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.Amazon would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Bear of the Day:The Estee Lauder Companies is one of the world's leading manufacturers and marketers of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. The company's products are sold through department stores, mass retailers, company-owned retail stores, hair salons, and travel-related establishments.Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook, landing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In addition, the stock currently resides in the Zacks – Cosmetics industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 24% (191 out of 251) of all Zacks Industries. Let's take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.Current StandingEstee Lauder shares have faced adverse price action throughout 2023, down more than 43% year-to-date and widely underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500. Shares have regularly faced selling pressure following quarterly releases.Regarding the latest release, the company exceeded consensus expectations handily but delivered weak results compared to the year-ago period; revenue saw 1.4% growth year-over-year, whereas adjusted EPS decreased 80% compared to the same period last year.The company's shareholder-friendly nature is worth highlighting, with EL sporting an 11% five-year annualized dividend growth rate. Shares presently yield a solid 1.9% annually paired with a payout ratio sitting at 77% of the company's earnings.The company enters its FY24 with a continued focus on accelerating balanced and profitable growth across regions, brands, product categories, and channels.Bottom LineNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company's shares in the near term.The Estee Lauder Companies is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company's earnings outlook.For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.Additional content:What to Expect from Domino's (DPZ) EarningsDomino's Pizza, Inc.is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 12, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.29 per share, suggesting 17.9% growth from the prior-year quarter. Over the past 60 days, earnings estimates have remained stable. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion, indicating a decline of 1.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteDomino's fiscal third-quarter results are likely to gain from robust same store sales growth, unit expansion, new menu addition and strong digitalization. DPZ continues to benefit from strong carryout and delivery businesses. It has been focusing on Car Side Delivery 2-Minute Guarantee with awareness campaigns. However, the company's top line is expected to have been hurt by a decline in sales of U.S. stores and supply-chain revenues.Our model predicts total U.S. store revenues to dip 0.1% to $355.3 million year over year. Moreover, our model estimates supply-chain revenues to fall 3.3% year over year to $624.7 million.An ease in inflationary pressure is likely to have aided the company's margin. Our model projects U.S. company-owned stores and supply-chain cost of sales to decrease 23.6% and 4.5% year over year, respectively. We expect gross margin in the quarter under review to be 39.4% compared with 35.7% reported in the prior-year quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn't conclusively predict an earnings beat for Domino's this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Domino's has an Earnings ESP of -1.92%.

384,68e504e3-0dec-3035-a4e3-400d3bc54730,PG,2023-10-12,Investors in Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) have seen solid returns of 101% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-procter-gamble-nyse-pg-110018189.html,1697108418,STORY,['PG'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. For example, long term The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) shareholders have enjoyed a 78% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 52% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 16% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Procter &amp; Gamble achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 12% per year. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Procter &amp; Gamble's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Procter &amp; Gamble the TSR over the last 5 years was 101%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveProcter &amp; Gamble shareholders gained a total return of 16% during the year. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 15% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

385,ad40f50c-4125-38ac-9780-1382ecd1c743,PG,2023-10-12,Procter & Gamble (PG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-pg-earnings-expected-140036511.html,1697032836,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.9%.Revenues are expected to be $21.64 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P&amp;G?For P&amp;G, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that P&amp;G will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that P&amp;G would post earnings of $1.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.37, delivering a surprise of +3.79%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.P&amp;G doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

386,1749a115-eb1f-328a-b7cc-ce6d568b93e8,DHI,2023-10-12,Returns On Capital Are A Standout For D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-standout-d-r-140009637.html,1697032809,STORY,['DHI'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on D.R. Horton is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$6.4b ÷ (US$32b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, D.R. Horton has an ROCE of 24%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Consumer Durables industry average of 15%. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton roceIn the above chart we have measured D.R. Horton's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for D.R. Horton.How Are Returns Trending?D.R. Horton is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 24%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 124%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.The Bottom LineTo sum it up, D.R. Horton has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. Since the stock has returned a staggering 194% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with D.R. Horton and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MCHP. Click here to check it out. ORLY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ORLYAs of 2023-10-11, O'Reilly Automotive Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $1126.25. It's currently trading at a price of $918.13. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 18.48%. The company is modestly undervalued.O'Reilly Automotive Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic ValueThe modelThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. O'Reilly Automotive Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.AssumptionsTermValueExplanationEPS without NRI$36.04GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.Discount Rate11%An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.55%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.Growth StageGrowth rate (g1) = 21.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.Terminal StageGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.CalculationGrowth Stage=EPS without NRI*[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)*(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=618.97Terminal Stage=EPS without NRI*(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10*[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)+(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2+...+(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]=643.34Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)=Growth Stage+Terminal Stage=1126.25Discounted Free Cash Flow ModelGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $1301.28. This valuation indicates that the O'Reilly Automotive Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 29.44%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.Story continuesThe Bottom LinePlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation.  Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.Navigating with GuruFocus:Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Not only do insurers collect premium income on the policies they underwrite but they also make money by investing the large sums of accumulated premiums that have not been paid out as claims.Due to this, many insurance stocks can be found on the various lists of long-term dividend growth stocks, such as the Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Kings.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe following three insurance stocks have long histories of dividend growth, solid dividend yields above the S&amp;P 500 average, and long-term growth potential.Equitable Holdings (EQH)Equitable Holdings (EQH) company logo icon on website, Illustrative EditorialSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comEquitable Holdings (NYSE:EQH) is a leading financial services company specializing in individual retirement, group retirement, investment management and research, and protection solutions. With a history tracing back to 1859, the firm was formerly a fully owned subsidiary of France’s AXA. The company completed its U.S. initial public offering (IPO) in 2018 and has raised its dividend every year since.Equitable Holdings reported Q2 2023 earnings on Aug. 2. For the quarter, the company reported net income of $2.06 per share, compared to the $2.47 in earnings per share (EPS) in the same period of 2022. The company also declared a dividend of 22 cents per share of common stock. This dividend was paid on Aug. 14.The company outlined some key growth initiatives during its inaugural investor day in May and provided some meaningful updates to the company’s financial guidance to 2027, including $2 billion of cash generation and 12%-15% non-GAAP operating EPS. Importantly for dividend investors, the company has revised its payout ratio target to 60%-70% of non-GAAP operating earnings.Story continuesWe expect that earnings and dividends will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6% over the next five years, with expected 2028 EPS of around $7.36 and a dividend payment of $1.18 per share.With reliable earnings, and an extremely low payout ratio of 16%, Equitable Holdings is well-positioned to carry on its growth strategy even in the face of rising interest rates and an overall negative macro climate. With the consistent cash flows from premiums coming in, and a comparatively low dividend expense, there is plenty of room to continue raising dividends. EQH stock yields 3.2%.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL), founded in 1955, is the world’s largest underwriter of supplemental cancer insurance. The diversified insurance corporation also provides accident, short-term disability, critical illness, dental, vision and life insurance. Roughly 70% of the company’s pretax earnings are from Japan, with 30% coming from the U.S.Aflac has a tremendous history of dividend increases. It has increased its dividend for 41 consecutive years, placing it on the exclusive list of Dividend Aristocrats.On Aug. 1, Aflac announced second-quarter results for the period ending June 30. For the quarter, the company reported $5.17 billion in revenue, a 2.8% decline compared to Q2 of 2022. However, revenue was $700 million higher than expected. On an adjusted basis, EPS equaled $1.58 versus $2.16 in the year-ago period. Adjusted book value increased 11.5% to $46.61 per share.Aflac has two sources of revenue: income from premiums and income from investments. On the premium side, this is generally sticky with policy renewals making up the bulk of income. However, Aflac operates in two developed markets where we would not anticipate outsized growth in the business. The other lever available is on the investment side, where the vast majority of the portfolio is in bonds. Here there is a possibility for income improvement should rates continue to rise in the future.Share buybacks will also boost Aflac’s EPS growth. Aflac repurchased 10.5 million shares at an average price of $66.67 during the most recent quarter. The company has 95.8 million shares, or 16% of its outstanding share count, remaining on its repurchase authorization.Aflac is expected to earn $5.96 in 2023. This means the dividend payout ratio is expected to be just under 30% for 2023, which indicates a safe dividend. AFL stock currently yields 2.2%.The Travelers Companies (TRV)miniature home next to pen, pad of paper, calculator and coins on a deskSource: MIND AND I / Shutterstock.comThe Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) was founded in 1864. The company began with life and accident insurance but has expanded into other types of coverage in the 150+ years since then. Today, it generates over $37 billion in annual revenue. The company offers a wide and deep variety of protection products for auto, home and business customers.Travelers posted second-quarter earnings on July 20. Revenue was up 10.5% year-over-year to $10.1 billion, which was $750 million ahead of estimates. Catastrophe losses of $1.481 billion pre-tax was double the year-ago period. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio improved 170 bps to 91.1%.Net written premiums were a new record of $10.32 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Earnings premium of $9.22 billion against $8.85 billion a year ago, as earned premiums were higher in all three segments. Book value per share declined fractionally from last year’s Q2 to $95.46, which was driven by higher interest rates. Net investment income was $712 million, up from $707 million a year ago.We expect 6% EPS growth over the next five years, even with the lower earnings base for 2023. Travelers could achieve this growth primarily from higher underwritten premiums and the buyback program, although margins should play a part as well, as long as there aren’t any large catastrophes. We forecast low single-digit gains from higher revenue as well as a similar tailwind from the company’s buyback, which has reduced the float by about a third in just the past decade.TRV maintains a dividend payout ratio of approximately 33%, which indicates a very safe dividend. TRV stock yields 2.4%.On the date of publication, Bob Ciura did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Supported by representatives of labor, hospitality, environmental groups and members of the public, California American Water made its case that they have, and will continue to be, the best stewards of the Monterey Peninsula’s water resources.California American Water raised multiple issues regarding the District’s plan, including that the District does not have the proper certification by the state to operate a water system, was denied permission by other local elected officials on the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) to become a retail water system, and has no previous experience in operating a water system. Even if successful in moving forward with its plan, the District intends to borrow as much as one billion dollars from investment banks to finance the purchase – more than 3,000 percent more than their current average budget.""The District is playing games with ratepayers money. The most likely scenario is that the District loses in court after spending tens of millions of dollars,"" said Evan Jacobs, Director of External Affairs for California American Water. ""The worst-case scenario is that they succeed and must borrow hundreds of millions of dollars to fund their novice efforts to operate a water system.""California American Water and its predecessor companies have operated the Monterey Peninsula’s water system since 1883. The system currently serves roughly 100,000 people with network of over 680 miles of pipeline and over 100 storage tanks. It is among the most complex water systems in California.Story continues""California American Water is adapting to climate resiliency and drought on the Central Coast while protecting the Carmel River and working with partners to find sustainable new water supplies. We have the technical, financial and managerial expertise that comes with decades of experience,"" said Chris Cook, Director of Operations at California American Water. ""The idea that an agency can transform itself into a water utility and start operating a system of this complexity, is risky.""The next step in the District’s ill-advised takeover process will necessitate legal action and ultimately a final decision by the court after a lengthy proceeding. California American Water is confident that its operational successes and financial management, coupled with legal precedent set by other similar attempts by public agencies to take over water systems, will result in California American Water retaining its water system.About California American Water:California American Water, a subsidiary of American Water (NYSE: AWK), provides high-quality and reliable water and wastewater services to more than 700,000 people.

Coca-Cola was not far behind, registering adjusted revenue of $11.97 billion, which exceeded expectations of $11.75 billion.PepsiCos challenges arose from its decision to increase product prices, which contributed to a 3% volume drop in food divisions and a 1% dip in beverages. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola navigated its own challenges, with a mere 1% decline in U.S. volume. Still, both giants showcased commendable resilience in their strategies. PepsiCo's CEO, Ramon Laguarta, highlighted the company's agility in a dynamic global environment. Conversely, Coca-Col CEO James Quincey acknowledged shifts in consumer preferences, particularly toward cheaper alternatives, yet remained cautiously optimistic.Story continuesWhen the dust settles and we are pressed to define a ""winner"" for the quarter, PepsiCo might just have the edge, chiefly due to its robust financial performance and slightly more optimistic full-year outlook. PepsiCo has adjusted its forecast to 10% organic revenue growth, up from a prior 8%. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, though certainly holding its own with revised expectations of 5% to 6% growth in adjusted earnings per share and an 8% to 9% increase in organic revenue, did not quite match PepsiCo's fervor.The future strategies of both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, especially around pricing, will be crucial determinants in the coming quarters.Financial overviewCoca-Cola's financial framework in 2023 reflects a robust and resilient company. The Atlanta-based behemoths financial strength rating stands at 6 out of 10. Key metrics reveal a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.38 and a debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 2.72, underscoring its aptitude in managing financial leverage while ensuring liquidity. The equity-to-asset ratio is pegged at 0.26, while the Piotroski F-Score is a strong 8 out of 9, showcasing the companys financial health. The Altman Z-Score of 3.91 places Coca-Cola in the safe zone, further alleviating concerns over financial distress.On the profitability side, Coca-Cola boasts a gross margin of 58.52%, translating to a net margin of 23.81%. The brand's power shines through its ability to maintain a return on equity of 43.38% and an impressive return on invested capital of 13.72%. Consistent with its historical performance, Coca-Cola has remained profitable for the past decade. The growth department reveals a three-year revenue growth rate of 4.6% and a future three to five-year total revenue growth rate of 5.35%.Valuation-wise, Coca-Cola's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 21.50 with a forward price-to-earnings of 18.46. The company's GF Value is estimated at $67.50, suggesting a modest undervaluation. Coca-Cola continues to reward its shareholders with a healthy dividend yield of 3.48% and has a payout ratio of 0.75.Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo: A Financial Showdown Reveals the King of Carbonated EfficiencyPepsiCo has a financial strength rating of 5 out of 10. The company's cash-to-debt ratio is lower at 0.15, while its debt-to-equity ratio stands higher at 2.47. However, the company also has a reassuring Altman Z-Score of 3.95. In the profitability arena, it reveals a gross margin of 53.58%, culminating in a net margin of 8.76%. The company's return on equity is slightly higher at 44.18%. It also has a return on invested capital of 12.82%.The company's growth has outpaced Coca-Cola in the past three years with a revenue growth rate of 9.3%. Its future three to five-year total revenue growth rate is projected to be 5.63%.As for valuation, PepsiCo's price-earnings ratio is higher at 27.92 with a forward price-earnings ratio of 19.66. Its GF Value stands at $192.64, indicating a modest undervaluation. Shareholders of Pepsi enjoy a dividend yield of 3.02% with a slightly higher payout ratio of 0.83.Coca-Cola vs. PepsiCo: A Financial Showdown Reveals the King of Carbonated EfficiencyBoth companies remain solid in their financial performance, but Coca-Cola is leading in profitability margins and liquidity, while PepsiCo has had faster near-term growth.Cash flow dynamicsWhen we delve deep into the financial tapestry of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, a fascinating narrative emerges. Coca-Cola, with its free cash flow for December 2022 standing at a robust $9.53 billion, seems to be enjoying a comfortable position. A quick calculation reveals that an impressive 22.17% of its revenue is converted into free cash flow for the said year. This, in the grand scheme of things, paints a picture of efficiency and possibly a commanding brand presence that ensures consistent cash inflows.Contrast this with PepsiCo, which recorded $5.60 billion in free cash flow for December 2022. Yet, when this figure is juxtaposed against the company's revenue, a mere 6.48% conversion emerges. It is a stark difference, especially when you consider that, in absolute terms, Pepsi's revenue dwarfs that of Coca-Cola. What this suggests is that while Pepsi might be raking in more money, its ability to transform that revenue into free cash flow, essentially the lifeblood of any business, is markedly lower than Coca-Cola's.Now, let's talk capital expenditure, a realm that often provides insight into a company's future ambitions. The data at hand does not spell out capital expenditure figures, but we can draw some inferences from the Ebitda and Ebitd values. If we consider the difference between these numbers as a proxy for depreciation and amortization (a reflection of past capital expenditures), Pepsi's figure overshadows Coca-Cola's. While it is not a direct measure, this could hint at Pepsi historically shelling out more in capital expenditures.Pepsi, with its sprawling revenue base, paints a more complex picture. Its conversion to free cash flow is notably more conservative than Coca-Cola's. Coupled with potentially heavier capital expenditures, it gives an impression of a brand investing aggressively to sustain or expand its operations.While revenue figures and growth rates provide a foundational understanding, it is the cash flow narrative that often reveals the true financial vitality of a company. In this scenario, Coca-Cola seems to be operating with a surgical efficiency, whereas Pepsi appears to be in the throes of aggressive expansion and investment.We have a winnerIn the arena of carbonated beverages, the financial bout between Coca-Cola and Pepsi has long been the subject of investors' scrutiny. Delving into the presented data, Coca-Cola shows superior prowess in its efficient conversion of revenue into free cash flow, a critical indicator of financial health and operational efficiency. As Buffett once said, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" In this context, Coca-Cola's financial metrics paint the picture of a more ""wonderful"" company from a cash flow standpoint.On the other hand, PepsiCo, while boasting higher revenue, trails in converting it into tangible free cash. This suggests a potentially aggressive expansion strategy, but at the cost of immediate cash efficiency. Peter Lynch's adage, ""Know what you own, and know why you own it,"" becomes pertinent here. PepsiCo's broader strategy may appeal to some, but its financial efficiency, as of the current data, seems to lag behind Coca-Cola's.In summary, after scrutinizing the financial indicators and overarching narratives, Coca-Cola emerges superior in this head-to-head analysis. While both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are commendable entities that I would be keen to invest in at a favorable price, they both stay on my radar for potential acquisition during market dips. From a branding and operational perspective, Coca-Cola takes the lead between the two.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

PEP reported robust third-quarter 2023 results, wherein revenues and earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines also improved year over year.The strong results reflect gains from strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems, and robust consumer demand trends. Shares gained 1.9% on Oct 10, reflecting a better-than-expected earnings result.The company also gained from the robust performance in the global beverage and convenient food businesses. Driven by strong results and business momentum, the company has raised its core constant-currency earnings per share (EPS) view for 2023.PepsiCo has considerable exposure to funds like Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP, Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF FSTA and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC. Each of these funds added about 1% on Oct 10.Quarter in DetailPepsiCo’s third-quarter core EPS of $2.25 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 and increased 14.2% year over year. In constant currency, core earnings improved 16% from the year-ago period. Adverse currency rates impacted EPS by 2% in the quarter.Net revenues of $23,453 million improved 6.7% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23,378 million. Revenues benefited from a robust price/mix in the reported quarter. Unit volume declined 1.5% year over year for the convenient food business and was flat year over year for the beverage business.On an organic basis, revenues grew 8.8% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies. This marked the 10th straight quarter of at least high-single-digit organic revenue growth for the company. The consolidated organic volume was down 2.5%, while effective net pricing improved 11% in the third quarter. Pricing gains were driven by strong realized prices across all segments.Story continuesOutlookPepsiCo raised its core EPS guidance for 2023. The company reaffirms its organic revenue growth prediction of 10% for 2023. It now anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of 13% from the year-ago period’s reported figure versus 12% growth stated earlier.PEP expects currency headwinds to hurt revenues and core EPS by 2 percentage points in 2023, based on the current rates. The company expects a core effective tax rate of 20% for 2023.Based on the above assumption, PepsiCo expects a core EPS of $7.54 for 2023 compared with the $7.47 mentioned earlier. This suggests an 11% increase from the core EPS of $6.79 reported in 2022 compared with 10% growth expected earlier.PepsiCo has been committed to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It expects to return a value worth $7.7 billion in 2023, including $6.7 billion of dividends. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase shares worth $1.0 billion in 2023.The company also outlined its initial view for 2024. It expects to deliver organic revenue and core constant currency EPS growth at the upper end of its long-term guidance ranges for 2024. The company had earlier predicted organic revenue growth of 4-6% and core constant currency EPS growth of high-single digit over the long term.Bottom LinePepsico has underperformed the broader sector lately.

More than 70 diagnostic tests are available- from general health profiles to tests for specific conditions, including heart health and sexually transmitted infections. Consumers can shop, schedule appointments for tests at our PSCs, and access results securely from their phone or computer. Beyond ease of use, questhealth.com reaches:Patients interested in reducing perceived barriers when accessing lab testing (lack of time, inconvenience, cost due to lack of health plan coverage, gaps in knowledge of tests and test selection, privacy concerns)Patients with chronic conditions who need regular testingPatients with higher risk who are focused on preventionProactive patients who are in good health and want more data on how to stay healthyPatients who want to understand an acute issue they are experiencingPatients are given the option to speak with an independent physician regardless of results. We plan to continue to expand the types of tests offered through this site.Access and affordabilityQuest continued to grow access to and affordability of our industry-leading diagnostic services in 2022 by expanding our reach across the US and building on our financial assistance programs. Quest for Health Equity (Q4HE), our philanthropic initiative with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, has also made strides in expanding the availability of services in under-resourced communities.Scaling access to our servicesTo reach more consumers, Quest introduced new relationships with retailers and hospital systems in 2022.We acquired the outreach lab services business of Summa Health in Ohio and Northern Light Health in Maine. This strengthened our ability to give access to our innovative test offerings to more providers and patients. We also continued to provide professional lab management services to health systems and hospitals, helping them to reduce their costs and make their services more affordable.Story continuesExpanding accessibility through financial assistanceWe aim to find solutions to serve patients who cannot easily afford diagnostic services. If a patient has a past-due bill, we offer clear communication regarding assistance options available to them. In addition, our Patient Financial Assistance (PFA) program provides a capped price on testing to patients whose income is near or below federally identified poverty levels. Effective January 1, 2023, we revised the PFA program to include more patients by extending the duration of eligibility following initial qualification from 6 to 12 months.Continued action on COVID-19Quest has played a significant role in mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic since 2020 and continues to do so. We have performed approximately 77 million COVID-19 molecular and serology tests and provided population health insights to federal, state, and local agencies, including the CDC, to aid the public health response strategy.In 2022, Quest expanded its COVID-19 retail pharmacy testing footprint from CVS®, Walmart, Giant Eagle®, and Safeway to include a national collaboration with Rite-Aid®. Rite-Aid and Bartell Drugs® worked together to offer at-home PCR specimen kits at 2,350 stores and on-site PCR collection at drive-through locations. Additionally, Quest participated in the CDC's Increasing Access to Testing program, which provides free COVID-19 lab testing at select Quest PSCs for uninsured patients in historically marginalized communities.Quest for Health Equity's growing impactQ4HE was launched in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Through Q4HE, Quest and the Quest Diagnostics Foundation are focused on addressing inequities in under-resourced communities by collaborating with local stakeholders to support community-driven priorities and advance equity in healthcare. In 2022, Q4HE expanded its reach through new relationships, providing grant funding, offering no-cost lab testing, and expanding workforce development.Expanding a community health program: Bread of LifeBread of Life has empowered communities in downtown Houston for the past 30 years by providing social support and services. Q4HE has accelerated the development of Bread of Life's Community Care Program by providing training and career opportunities for phlebotomists and community health workers. Q4HE investment also goes toward sustaining collaborations with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Free and Charitable Clinics. A portion of the grant issued to Bread of Life is regranted to other community-based organizations that address issues such as food insecurity and provide access to behavioral health services.""We are proud of the progress we've made through our Q4HE collaborations to address the health equity gap and look forward to deepening our impact in 2023.""MICHAEL K. FLOYD, Sr Director, Quest for Health EquityIncreasing outreach with Choose Healthy LifeQ4HE has continued to fund Choose Healthy Life, a program dedicated to enhancing the capacity of Black churches to promote community wellness. Pairing community health workers (Health Navigators) with church leaders at each of the program's 60 churches, participants benefit from having ""trusted messengers"" from the community assist them in making decisions impacting their health.The next phase of Choose Healthy Life launched in October 2022 with a focus on providing no-cost access to Blueprint for Wellness®. Participants are given specific insights into the state of their health, as well as guidance on how to improve results. Participants can also be screened for eligibility for key social services, like housing, food benefits, and connecting to a healthcare provider.Delivering specialty care to patients who are uninsured and underinsuredThrough Q4HE, the Quest Diagnostics Foundation has provided a grant to ConferMED™, a national network of specialists providing telehealth services. ConferMED brings their technology and network of specialty physicians to provide e-consults to patients at underserved community health centers. Patients benefit from efficient access to specialty care, fewer trips to providers, and reduced expenses caused by additional medical visits, including childcare, transportation, and time away from work. Patients also avoid unnecessary or duplicative tests and procedures and other risks inherent to exposure to the medical system. These translate directly to increased productivity at work and reduced absenteeism. Through the Q4HE grant, as of December 1, 2022, ConferMED has enrolled 19 FQHCs, serving patients who are uninsured and underinsured in the Miami, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, and Boston areas.Changing the face of healthcareTo make healthcare more accessible-and truly patient-centered- inequity in both access and outcomes must be addressed. Expanding the pool of minority medical students, researchers, and administrators is one way to build awareness and trust and give underrepresented communities an additional voice in the medical system.In 2022, the Quest Diagnostics Foundation continued its support of the American Heart Association's Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Scholars Initiative programs. These initiatives provide undergraduate professional, workforce, and research development opportunities for future leaders in STEM and healthcare. One hundred percent of participants in both programs have graduated or are on track to receive a 2-year or 4-year STEM degree. Of those who have obtained their undergraduate degree, about half are pursuing additional degrees in this space while the other ~50% are either working in biomedicine/ healthcare or are seeking employment in these fields.*Visit our Quest for Health Equity website to learn more.*2022-2023 school year.Read moreView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/quest-diagnosticsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/792074/expanding-healthcare-access-and-affordability-at-quest-diagnostics]"

If you want to see some more of the world’s biggest asset managers, go directly to the 5 Biggest Publicly Traded Asset Managers.An asset manager handles combined funds for their clients, investing them accordingly. While hedge funds may be the most widely recognized type of asset management company, there exist various other categories of asset managers, including those overseeing mutual funds, ETFs, and index funds.In 2022, asset managers encountered a challenging period as assets under management (AuM) plummeted to $115.1 trillion, marking a nearly 10% decrease from the 2021 peak of $127.5 trillion. This decline was the most substantial in a decade. Looking ahead to the coming two years, inflation, market volatility, and shifts in interest rates are the primary concerns for both investors and asset managers. Nonetheless, PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, anticipates a recovery by 2027, projecting AuM to attain a base case of $147.3 trillion, showcasing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%.As we move further into the second half of the year, the stock market is beginning to reflect the expected impacts of the impending recession, aligning with predictions from J.P. Morgan Research. The firm anticipates a gradual economic decline in the United States by late 2023, primarily due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach, resulting in tighter credit conditions that will gradually dampen economic growth. While many stocks are on a downward trend, certain industries are flourishing despite this economic strain, presenting attractive investment opportunities for global investors. Some noteworthy sectors include Utilities, Healthcare, Consumer Staples, Communication Services, and DIY, along with related industries.The asset and wealth management sector is undergoing significant transformations due to a range of hurdles, including pressure on fees, escalating costs, and shifting investor preferences. These challenges are further heightened by market instability, increasing interest rates, inflation, and impending economic downturns. Nevertheless, the fundamental foundation of the industry remains robust, offering potential for appealing profitability. Moreover, there's a growing interest in alternative investments, thematic investment demands, and a preference for digital engagement. To capitalize on opportunities within the asset management domain, some top publicly traded options for investors include the likes of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).Story continuesBiggest Publicly Traded Asset ManagersPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this list of the 25 biggest publicly traded asset managers in the world, we used the rankings of The SWFI and ranked institutions by the total managed AUM.

(NYSE:MUFG), headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan, operates as a prominent Japanese bank holding and financial services company.
