And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Verisk Analytics share price has climbed 90% in five years, easily topping the market return of 41% (ignoring dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Verisk Analytics achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 19% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Verisk Analytics the TSR over the last 5 years was 95%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveVerisk Analytics shareholders are down 20% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -19%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 14%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   4 warning signs for Verisk Analytics (1 is a bit concerning)  that you should be aware of.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Hong Kong's rising affluents' sense of financial wellbeing are most impacted by current macroeconomic conditions as this year's study revealed a broad-based decline in sub-index scores against a backdrop of rising inflation and market volatility.The ""Hong Kong Rising Affluent Financial Well-being Index 2022"" is the 5th edition of Charles Schwab's annual survey that explores shifting perceptions and investment behaviours of rising affluents in Hong Kong, aged between 18 and 65 with a monthly income of HK$20,000 to HK$80,000. From September 7 to September 22, 2022, the survey interviewed 1,048 respondents. This year's overall financial well-being score came in at 56.43 out of 100, a 2.70-point decrease from last year's results. Calculated by the Structural Equation Model (SEM), 16 indicators were designed to formulate the financial well-being index which consists of four sub-indexes, including:Confidence sub-index (53.40, -3.76) studies investors' satisfaction towards their personal financial status, their level of confidence towards their personal financial growth prospects as well as preparation for issues that impact their personal financial statusPlanning sub-index (26.15, -0.30) reveals whether investors have and regularly review their financial plan, set timelines for financial goals, and have a sense of possibility on achieving financial goalsManagement sub-index (71.58, -1.52) demonstrates investors' sense of risk, attitude towards portfolio management, and sensitivity towards feesEngagement sub-index (60.79, -2.86) determines investors' usage of financial services, trust towards professional financial advisors and digital financial advisory platformsStory continuesUncertainties cloud investor confidence, but overseas investments hold key to financial well-being Hong Kong's rising affluents' financial confidence fell by 3.76% from last year in the current volatile macro environment. Concerns over inflation rose most significantly from last year (+8.2% versus 2021) and Hong Kong rising affluents are increasingly worried about the rising cost of living, particularly the impact on personal debt (+3.7% versus 2021) and children's education (+3.5% versus 2021).Personal professional income (49.4%) and a stable household income (46.3%) are the top sources of confidence for Hong Kong's rising affluents. However, the survey findings showed that adequate retirement preparation becomes a more important source of confidence especially with age. More than half (55.1%) of older rising affluents, aged between 55 to 65 years old, indicated adequate retirement preparation as their No. 1 source of confidence compared to 24.3% of young rising affluents aged 18 to 34 years old and 29.5% aged between 35 to 44 years old.Across the board, Hong Kong's rising affluents with overseas investments are more financially confident than their peers. About 15.0% of overseas investors (+3.2% versus 2021) feel more satisfied with their personal financial status compared to 8.9% of non-overseas investors (-7.3% versus 2021). More overseas investors (+7.3% versus 2021) are also optimistic about their personal financial growth prospects, believing that their financial economic situation will improve over the next 5 years, compared to a 4.1% decline among non-overseas investors.The number of overseas investors among Hong Kong's rising affluents rose to 37% this year, a significant increase from 20% in 2021. Diversification to improve overall financial security (51.9%) and a higher return on investment (48.1%) are the top motivators for overseas investments. The U.S. remains a key overseas market for Hong Kong's rising affluents – investment allocation to the U.S. doubled from 9.7% last year to 19.7%.Michael Fong, managing director, Charles Schwab Hong Kong, said, ""Rising cost of living is clearly top of mind for Hong Kong's rising affluents this year due to the current higher inflationary environment. As a result, investors are looking to obtain higher returns and are increasingly recognising the importance of overseas investments in helping them achieve their goals in a volatile macro environment.""""The US market in particular offers Hong Kong investors serious portfolio diversification opportunities given its size, liquidity and transparency, all of which are critical in helping deliver risk-adjusted returns during periods of high market volatility,"" Fong added.Financial planning and advice more important than everWith the current challenging macro environment, rising affluents in Hong Kong are investing less as personal liquid assets shrink, coupled with rising living costs, affected their overall savings and investments rate. Respondents' personal liquid assets of shrank by 11.9% year-over-year, while regular monthly savings and investment in financial products fell by 4.8% and 8.0% respectively.However, despite the decrease in personal assets and investments, a greater number of rising affluents believe that they need a financial plan (+6.9% versus 2021) as well as a clearer and longer timeline to achieve their financial goals (+6.4% versus 2021).The desire for financial advice remains high across the board among respondents, particularly for those who manage their family's money. Among the rising affluents who have a financial plan, more than 1 in 5 (23.7%) hired a professional financial advisor. Meanwhile, 41.3% of rising affluents who manage family's money have consulted a financial advisor, compared to 25.1% of those who manage their own money only.Rising affluents who received professional financial advice also tend to be more notably satisfied with their financial planning (47.7% versus 38.7% for those who made their own plans). In terms of age groups, the younger rising affluents aged between 18 to 34 years old are more likely to be dissatisfied with their financial plans due to a lack of professional suggestions (52.8% compared to 27% of older rising affluents aged between 56 to 65 years old).When it comes to professional financial planning, more than a third of rising affluents (37.7%) believe that their financial advisors can provide the most help when it comes to the development and optimization of their financial plan. A much greater number of rising affluents this year (+8.1% versus 2021) also believe that professional financial advice can help to develop a reliable investment plan for them.Fong said, ""It is heartening to see a significant rise in the number of rising affluents in Hong Kong agreeing that financial planning is important in keeping them financially prepared to achieve their life goals. Having access to professional insights and advice are more critical than ever to help investors stay on track with clarity for long-term and overseas investments under volatile market conditions. This closely aligns with our commitment to actively engage with our clients on their financial goals and to provide disciplined financial advice to help them take advantage of the global market opportunities that may help them to achieve their financial goals.""About Charles Schwab Hong Kong Rising Affluent Financial Well-being IndexCharles Schwab Hong Kong appointed Nielsen, an international research organization to conduct the Charles Schwab Hong Kong Rising Affluent Financial Well-being Index.

2,0077945b-9c0e-3fda-a097-3cd947e1f9c3,RRC,2022-12-13,Key Factors That Affected Natural Gas Markets Last Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-affected-natural-gas-130601615.html,1670850361,STORY,"['EQT', 'NG=F', 'RRC', 'CRK']","[The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures fell slightly week over week.Despite this, the market has been kind to natural gas in 2022, with the commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $10 for the first time since 2008. Natural gas stocks like Range Resources RRC, EQT Corporation EQT and Comstock Resources CRK have been some of the prime beneficiaries of the price appreciation.EIA Reports a Withdrawal Smaller Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 21 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec 2, below the guidance of 26 Bcf decline per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.The decrease was also above last year’s pull of 59 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net shrinkage of 49 Bcf.The third draw of the winter heating season puts total natural gas stocks at 3,462 Bcf, which is 51 Bcf (1.5%) below the 2021 level at this time and 58 Bcf (1.6%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 105.4 Bcf per day, down 0.6 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to a decrease in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption improved 6.8% to 115.5 Bcf from 108.1 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a stronger power burn and increased residential/commercial demand during end-November.Natural Gas Logs a Small Weekly LossNatural gas prices edged down last week, following the lower-than-expected inventory draw. Futures for January delivery ended Friday at $6.245 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 0.6% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization — for the second successive week — is also the result of forecasts for milder weather and the extended shutdown of the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. The latest models anticipate tepid temperature-driven consumption over the near term (with less extensive use of heaters across homes and businesses), which is a negative for prices.The one thing supporting natural gas is a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere.Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means that LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with squeezed natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe, following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out some of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart by the end of December after several missed target dates. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsDespite some hiccups in between, the natural gas market is still up almost 70% so far this year. While fundamental indicators continue to suggest strong price levels, the natural gas market is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, EQT and Comstock Resources.Range Resources: The upstream firm has a strong footing in the prolific Appalachian Basin. In the gas-rich resource, RRC has huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.Range Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of 151.5% for the current year. Valued at around $6.1 billion, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported EPS of $1.37 for the third quarter, reflecting a 0.7% surprise over consensus. RRC shares have climbed 41.4% this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with a primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 347.8% for the current year. EQT’s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is currently 56%, which compares favorably with the industry's growth rate of 28.4%. EQT — valued at around $13.1 billion — has soared 63.5% this year.Comstock Resources: The company is active in the Haynesville shale in North Louisiana and East Texas — a premier natural gas basin. As of now, CRK has a projected earnings growth rate of 212.1% for the current year.Comstock Resources, with a market capitalization of $3.3 billion, enjoys a Zacks Value and Growth Style Score of A each, and an overall VGM Score of A.

The steel executives were also confident that fixed contract tons recently negotiated for 2023 will safeguard their businesses against market turbulence.Leon Topalian, Nucor president and CEO, said in a statement: “During the third quarter, Congress passed the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, two pieces of legislation that will strengthen domestic manufacturing and create opportunities in the future for the American steel industry.

(NYSE:BHP) is an example of a quality company at a moderate valuation that should deliver attractive long-term returns. We believe the market has undervalued its enduring competitive advantage due to its low cost iron and copper mining operations which has allowed the company to deliver consistent profits and cash flows across the inevitable ups and downs of the global metals cycle. While the variability of commodity prices prevents BHP from scoring in the top ranks of measured quality, we are willing to bear some of that uncertainty in return for a more attractive valuation given the company’s strong business fundamentals.”7.

7,726591d5-3a7b-354c-a7d1-3a842a190296,UNM,2022-12-13,Investing Tip for 2023: Focus on These 4 Low P/CF Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-tip-2023-focus-4-133301179.html,1670851981,STORY,"['UNM', 'CLS.TO', 'AER', 'CLS']","[To tame inflation, the Federal Reserve has hiked the benchmark interest rate six times this year, and will not shy from doing it again at its upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting. However, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comment on lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December, analysts are anticipating a 0.5 percentage point hike. This is down from 0.75 percentage point increases done in the recent past. Evidently, the Fed’s action will determine the course of the stock market in 2023.So, the question is, how to refine the portfolio to endure the challenging circumstances. Well, apply a holistic approach. Look for stocks that are fundamentally sound and offer security as well as resilience with a long-term upside potential.Here's Investing TipWe always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks. But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless blessed with Midas touch. When it comes to the investment market, experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that have good things going on for them, even at a time when they have been beaten down by some external factors.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, we recommend Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) as one of the key metrics. This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis — the lower the number, the better. Celestica Inc. CLS, Unum Group UNM, AerCap Holdings N.V. AER, and Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL  boast a low P/CF ratio.Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric, when the most widely used metric is Price/Earnings (or P/E). Well, what makes P/CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly reflecting the financial health of a company.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use.A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company’s liquid assets. This gives the company the means to settle debt, shell out for its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Then again, a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesWhat’s the Best Strategy?An investment decision solely based on the P/CF metric may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks that are trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and also consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Celestica, a leader in design, manufacturing and supply-chain solutions for the world's most innovative companies, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Under the latest change some 40% of the firm's index equity assets could be voted by investors, State Street said.Rival index managers BlackRock and Vanguard are also delegating voting responsibilities. The big three index fund managers run nearly $20 trillion between them and are among the largest shareholders of most top U.S. corporations plus many other globally.Their low fees have brought in huge deposits of new investor cash. But the increased market power has brought criticism from all sides of the political spectrum targeting how the funds have cast votes at corporate annual meetings on sensitive topics like climate change or workers' rights.The Sierra Club for instance hasthreatenedto withdraw money from BlackRock over its softer support for environmental resolutions earlier this year.Meanwhile, last week, U.S. Republican Senators said the index fund firms use proxy voting to change managerial decision at portfolio companies, ""relying on the implied threat that an asset manager will vote against particular directors or oppose management on controversial shareholder resolutions.""In response State Street said it was open to talks but added ""we believe our asset stewardship is an important component of our overall investment program and serves the best interests of our clients.""

(NYSE:TMO)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-thermo-fisher-140123852.html,1670853683,STORY,['TMO'],"[Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Thermo Fisher Scientific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific What Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Worth?Thermo Fisher Scientific appears to be overvalued by 37% at the moment, based on my discounted cash flow valuation. The stock is currently priced at US$560 on the market compared to my intrinsic value of $408.37. This means that the opportunity to buy Thermo Fisher Scientific at a good price has disappeared! In addition to this, it seems like Thermo Fisher Scientific’s share price is quite stable, which could mean two things: firstly, it may take the share price a while to fall back down to an attractive buying range, and secondly, there may be less chances to buy low in the future once it reaches that value. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Thermo Fisher Scientific?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Thermo Fisher Scientific. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in TMO’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe TMO should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TMO for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TMO, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

(CF) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-cf-industries-holdings-140002957.html,1670853602,STORY,['CF'],"[CF Industries (CF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this fertilizer maker have returned -4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Fertilizers industry, to which CF belongs, has lost 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.CF is expected to post earnings of $4.31 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $16.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +295.3%. This estimate has changed -4.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $15.11 indicates a change of -9.9% from what CF is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, CF is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CF _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For CF, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.86 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +12.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $11.44 billion and $9.82 billion estimates indicate +74.9% and -14.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCF reported revenues of $2.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +70.4%. EPS of $2.55 for the same period compares with $0.96 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.74%. The EPS surprise was -20.06%.Over the last four quarters, CF surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.CF is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about CF. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

However, the pandemic after effects, rate hikes and supply-chain disruptions due to the ongoing Ukraine war are expected to slash the apparel industry CAGR by 3.8% and the market is projected to reach a share of $768.26 billion in 2026 at the CAGR of 6.1%. McKinsey opines that the luxury market is likely to outperform the rest of the apparel industry since wealthy shoppers’ shopping patterns are largely unaffected by market downturns. They forecast a growth rate for luxury fashion to be 5 to 10% in the US in 2023. As for the masses, the Consumer Pulse survey found that more US-based consumers have switched brands to find lower prices than at any other time since the pandemic. Of those that switched, more than a third went for private-label products and the 90% of them stated that they intend to incorporate this behavior into their routines.TrendsThe luxury clothing industry has been the strongest performer in the larger apparel market, with a 33% shareholder return relative to 9% in the value segment. However, athleisure-wear is fast rising in popularity among regular as well as luxury customers. Athleisure market generated a growth of about 20.3% from 2019-2021, as people worked from home and switched to a more casual and sports wardrobe during lockdowns. By comparison, the traditional apparel industry returns were 4.5% for the same period, per McKinsey.The athleisure market is expected to grow with a CAGR of nearly 7% from 2019 to 2026, per the Allied Market Research, reaching a market share of $257 billion.Key PlayersSome of the major brands in the clothing industry include Louis Vuitton, Prada and Burberry.

This makes the dividend yield 4.2%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. View our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares' Earnings Will Easily Cover The DistributionsA big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained.Huntington Bancshares has a long history of paying out dividends, with its current track record at a minimum of 10 years. Past distributions do not necessarily guarantee future ones, but Huntington Bancshares' payout ratio of 47% is a good sign as this means that earnings decently cover dividends.The next 3 years are set to see EPS grow by 22.6%. Analysts estimate the future payout ratio will be 43% over the same time period, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendHuntington Bancshares Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $0.16, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.62. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.We Could See Huntington Bancshares' Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that Huntington Bancshares has been growing its earnings per share at 9.1% a year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.We Really Like Huntington Bancshares' DividendOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Proactive reputation management is critical, but scanning for inaccurate or defamatory content at scale in real-time is increasingly difficult in a polarized and high-velocity landscape.""The advancement in the scope and sophistication of misinformation creates a growing concern for CMOs,"" said Chris Ross, VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Just as AI and other technologies contribute to the content problem, they will also be part of the solution, especially when complemented with dedicated teams that listen, engage, and escalate brand interests across the digital content ecosystem.""By 2025, 70% of enterprise CMOs will identify accountability for ethical AI in marketing among their top concerns.Privacy-related restrictions on data collection, economic pressures, and AI breakthroughs are driving marketing teams to rely more heavily on AI and machine learning to optimize campaign performance and lower costs.Story continuesSimultaneously, regulators and advocacy groups are vocalizing concerns about manipulative and biased uses of AI through developments such as the AI Act in the EU or the AI Bill of Rights in the U.S. Several brands have come under fire over their use of advanced technology to influence consumers in creepy and inequitable ways.""Marketing is uniquely positioned to understand the superior CX AI affords as well as its trust and reputational risks,"" said Frank. ""This puts the onus on marketers to address the ethical issues that AI is raising in their practices, and the impetus to do so must come from the top.""By 2024, 70% of brands will redeploy at least 10% of their media budget to product placement in entertainment content.Consumers with means are working harder than ever to avoid online ads: Gartner anticipates that by next year, 85% of consumers with household incomes above $120K will pay for entertainment subscription tiers, software, hardware or mobile devices that allow them to avoid advertising entirely.""The game of cat-and-mouse has become very expensive,"" said Kate Muhl, VP Analyst at Gartner. ""Brands pay top dollar to reach high income consumers via digital advertising, but such impressions become less meaningful as this audience figures out new ways to tune them out. Marketers who cling to traditional digital ad formats will increasingly reach an audience composed largely of digital have-nots.""Instead, brands that shift budgets toward product placements in entertainment content such as streaming TV will persevere: Two-thirds of the 301 consumers surveyed in October 2022 said they prefer this format rather than seeing separate ads.One-in-three businesses without a loyalty program today will establish one by 2027 to shore up first-party data collection and retain high-priority customers.At present, loyalty programs are most prevalent in the travel, hospitality and retail industries. However, there are opportunities in other verticals, such as banking and consumer packaged goods. Only 36% of 1,068 brands Gartner analyzed in 2022 had a loyalty program.Effective loyalty content generally drives higher open rates than non-loyalty emails, improving wallet retention and growth among high-priority customer segments. By 2023, both B2B and B2C companies will increase their investments in loyalty programs as a percentage of their total marketing budget.""The competition for customers' attention and first-party data will increase as more companies launch and revamp loyalty programs,"" said Brad Jashinsky, Director Analyst at Gartner. ""CMOs running best in-class loyalty programs will elevate their approach beyond transactional benefits and recognize personalization as a critical differentiator.""By 2025, organizations that use AI across the marketing function will shift 75% of their staff’s operations from production to more strategic activities.The use of AI in marketing operations will reduce friction and eliminate redundancy, allowing marketers to shift their budgets and resources to activities that support a more dynamic marketing organization.For example, marketers can leverage AI in the creative process to automate the capturing, processing, and analyzing of real-world images and videos, improving image quality and developing digital twins. ""AI will continue to refine marketing operations processes to drive more agile, data-based responses to the challenges ahead that have no signs of slowing down,"" said Nicole Greene, Sr Director Analyst at Gartner.Gartner clients can learn more in the report: ""Predicts 2023: AI, Social Toxicity and Disappearing Customers Forge the Future of Marketing.""

To address chronic talent shortages, chief sales officers (CSOs) must challenge existing recruitment practices and take steps to retain and motivate diverse talent.With only three available candidates per open B2B sales job, and roles staying open for an average of two months, CSOs identify talent as their top external challenge.""CSOs are facing a talent crisis, yet are leaving crucial talent out of its pipeline,"" said Christopher Gamble, Senior Director Analyst in the Gartner for Sales Leaders Practice.""Historically, the sales function has neglected to attract high-potential candidates from underrepresented groups, but the pressures from operating shorthanded require a renewed focus on improving and diversifying the talent pipeline,"" Gamble said. ""DEI efforts — targeting the talent pipeline, current sellers and sales leadership — are an imperative step in addressing current and future talent needs.""Challenge existing recruitment practicesSales leaders who are unwilling to challenge existing recruitment efforts stand to miss out on highly qualified candidates. The traditional candidate profile for a B2B sales rep relies on sales experience rather than skills, biasing the candidate pool toward those already in the function.In addition, visible diversity in leadership sends a signal to candidates about the sales culture and the organization’s focus on DEI. Potential job-seekers may have a negative perception of the sales culture of B2B organizations where a lack of diversity is the norm.To open up recruitment to a wider pool of candidates and attract diverse talent, CSOs should partner with HR to:Refocus candidate profiles on skills and behaviors — rather than experience — to widen the talent pool.Write job postings that properly frame the position to avoid skewed recruiting toward the same talent pool and demographics. Leverage tools that can bias-check postings.Story continuesRetain and motivate diverse talentMembers of underrepresented groups may fear that a sales organization presents an unsupportive or even discriminatory environment, which does not bode well for retention nor motivation.""To retain the best sellers in the future, sales leaders must quell any negative perceptions of their sales culture by establishing an employee value proposition (EVP) that not only signals a commitment to DEI but also delivers on that promise by valuing and supporting sellers equitably,"" said Gamble.Specific recommendations include:Elevate the attraction, retention and promotion of historically underrepresented talent to the same priority level as other KPIs, such as quota attainment.Mentor diverse employees from within and outside the sales organization to help sales leaders increase their awareness of DEI challenges and uncover potential biases.Invest in productivity, collaboration and learning tools that support anywhere/anytime hybrid work.Gartner clients can read more in ""Predicts 2023: Surfing the Waves of Change in B2B Sales Talent"".

It's on course for its first monthly decline since September, having lost 1.2% so far, but is still on track for a 12.6% gain this quarter, its strongest quarterly performance since the final three months of 2020.However, core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices - two key drivers of the rise in price pressures over the last year - has steadily risen in this time.The core consumer price index is expected to have risen by 6.1% in November from October's 6.3%, while headline inflation is forecast to have fallen to 7.3% from 7.7%.""At the moment, market sentiment has really been built on the idea that U.S. inflation is heading lower, so I think that if that doesn't happen ... if we saw that even flatline, there is a significant risk here that it undermines what we’ve been seeing in terms of the market move towards the upside and the gains we’ve seen over Q4 so far,"" IG strategist Joshua Mahony said.The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies , holding roughly steady against the euro, the yen and the pound. It's lost nearly 6.5% in value so far in the fourth quarter, largely because investors believe U.S. inflation has peaked.In Europe, stocks got off to modestly higher start, led by gains in oil and gas companies thanks to a 1.1% rise in crude oil prices after the temporary shutdown of a key pipeline that feeds into the United States. That added to concerns around a squeeze on supply, especially as China is loosening some of its strict COVID restrictions.Story continuesThe STOXX was up 0.7%, while London's FTSE 100 gained 0.2%, as did Frankfurt's DAX.In China itself, blue chip stocks dropped between 0.2% and 0.3% as investors factored in the chances that looser restrictions on activity would lead to a surge in COVID infections that could hamper economic growth.But a tourism-linked index jumped more than 2% as Hong Kong eased COVID-19 restrictions for inbound travellers.Later this week, the Fed, European Central Bank and the Bank of England (BoE) are all expected to raise rates by 50 basis points (bps), rather than the 75 bps hikes they delivered earlier in the year.The pound edged up against dollar, up 0.2% to $1.2296 and by a similar amount against the euro, which traded around 85.73 pence, after data showed a rise in UK unemployment and an increase in wage growth that will keep BoE policymakers on edge when they meet this week.Oil rallied for a second day, having jumped 2.5% on Monday, with Brent crude futures up 1.1% at $78.88 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate crude up 0.9% at $73.85.Gold futures, which are sensitive to shifts in U.S. inflation, were last up 0.2% at $1,783.20 an ounce.(Additional reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor in Singapore; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Mark Potter and David Evans)]"

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3%.The slowdown could give the Federal Reserve cover to start scaling back the size of its interest rate increases on Wednesday.""This month's report provides confirmation of October's step down in inflation pressures and is welcome news for the Fed,"" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday morning.""Tomorrow's reduction in the pace of tightening to 50 (basis points) was already telegraphed, and with the downtrend in inflation becoming entrenched, the FOMC can set its sights squarely on the labor market.""Wall Street stocks jumped on the news in morning trading but then pulled back to more modest gains by the afternoon.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.74% and the Nasdaq Composite added 1%.

Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management's Chief Investment Strategist, said in an email.""It's all a balancing act, which we believe points to near-term choppy markets even though the improving inflation backdrop adds a positive bias.""BOND YIELDS, DOLLAR DIPU.S. Treasury yields dropped on the November inflation data.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 9.2 basis points to 3.519%; 30-year yields fell 3.2 basis points to 3.544%, and two-year yields, which typically move in step with interest rate expectations, dropped 16.4 basis points to 4.239%.Story continuesThe dollar also declined, dropping nearly 1% against a basket of major currencies.

Data showed a rise in UK unemployment and an increase in wage growth that will keep Bank of England (BoE) policymakers on edge when they meet this week.The BoE, Fed and European Central Bank are expected to raise rates by 50 basis points (bps), rather than the 75 bps hikes they delivered earlier in the year.""If data such as today's suggest a real trend that the momentum of inflation is lower, we could then see the Fed pause over the next few months at a still restrictive policy-rate, but not one which would put potentially excessive pressure on the economy,"" Rick Rieder, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, said in a statement.Traders are now betting on 25-basis-point increases at each of the Fed's first two meetings of 2023 and no more, with some chance the last hike could come in May instead of March, bringing the policy rate to between 4.75% and 5%.COMMODITIES UPOil rallied for a second day, having jumped 2.5% on Monday, with U.S. crude up 3.12% to $75.45 per barrel and Brent at $80.68, up 3.45% on the day. The market was buoyed by concern about supply disruptions, including the ongoing shutdown of the Canada-to-U.S. Keystone crude pipeline following a massive leak.Gold, which is sensitive to shifts in U.S. inflation, also gained, with spot gold up 1.6% to $1,810.26 an ounce and U.S. gold futures up 1.77% to $1,813.90 an ounce.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin climbed around 3.4% to $17,750, and crypto-related stocks gained, even as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested and charged by U.S. regulators, and Binance registered $1.9 billion of withdrawals in the past 24 hours.(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne in Boston and Amanda Cooper in London; Editing by Grant McCool and Rosalba O'Brien)]"

37,4456c925-a379-305a-b2c4-a15facd37451,MS,2022-12-13,Great week for Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) institutional investors after losing 4.5% over the previous year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/great-week-morgan-stanley-nyse-110149015.html,1670929309,STORY,['MS'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 64% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.After a year of 4.5% losses, last week’s 4.1% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Morgan Stanley, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Morgan Stanley's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc., with ownership of 22%. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Morgan Stanley in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$402m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Morgan Stanley. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 22% of Morgan Stanley stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Morgan Stanley that you should be aware of before investing here.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

It's on course for its first monthly decline since September, having lost 1.2% so far, but is still on track for a 12.6% gain this quarter, its strongest quarterly performance since the final three months of 2020.However, core inflation, which strips out food and energy prices - two key drivers of the rise in price pressures over the last year - has steadily risen in this time.The core consumer price index is expected to have risen by 6.1% in November from October's 6.3%, while headline inflation is forecast to have fallen to 7.3% from 7.7%.""At the moment, market sentiment has really been built on the idea that U.S. inflation is heading lower, so I think that if that doesn't happen ... if we saw that even flatline, there is a significant risk here that it undermines what we’ve been seeing in terms of the market move towards the upside and the gains we’ve seen over Q4 so far,"" IG strategist Joshua Mahony said.The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies , holding roughly steady against the euro, the yen and the pound. It's lost nearly 6.5% in value so far in the fourth quarter, largely because investors believe U.S. inflation has peaked.In Europe, stocks got off to modestly higher start, led by gains in oil and gas companies thanks to a 1.1% rise in crude oil prices after the temporary shutdown of a key pipeline that feeds into the United States. That added to concerns around a squeeze on supply, especially as China is loosening some of its strict COVID restrictions.Story continuesThe STOXX was up 0.7%, while London's FTSE 100 gained 0.2%, as did Frankfurt's DAX.In China itself, blue chip stocks dropped between 0.2% and 0.3% as investors factored in the chances that looser restrictions on activity would lead to a surge in COVID infections that could hamper economic growth.But a tourism-linked index jumped more than 2% as Hong Kong eased COVID-19 restrictions for inbound travellers.Later this week, the Fed, European Central Bank and the Bank of England (BoE) are all expected to raise rates by 50 basis points (bps), rather than the 75 bps hikes they delivered earlier in the year.The pound edged up against dollar, up 0.2% to $1.2296 and by a similar amount against the euro, which traded around 85.73 pence, after data showed a rise in UK unemployment and an increase in wage growth that will keep BoE policymakers on edge when they meet this week.Oil rallied for a second day, having jumped 2.5% on Monday, with Brent crude futures up 1.1% at $78.88 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate crude up 0.9% at $73.85.Gold futures, which are sensitive to shifts in U.S. inflation, were last up 0.2% at $1,783.20 an ounce.(Additional reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor in Singapore; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore, Mark Potter and David Evans)]"

Its level of future adoption, therefore, is more sensitive to changes in interest rates – or has a longer duration – than gold, Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a research report Monday looking at the benefits of both assets in a diversified portfolio.In the last year came the “end of a decade of easy money” as central banks raised interest rates saw a sharp reduction in speculative positions in gold and bitcoin, the report said. However, gold is roughly unchanged year on year, whereas bitcoin is down 75%, in line with high-growth tech companies.Tight financial conditions are expected to be a drag on bitcoin’s user adoption, the report said, and this makes a repeat of the cryptocurrency’s strong returns of the last decade less likely. Volatility will likely remain elevated until it develops more use cases.“The development of real use cases is also crucial to reducing bitcoin’s volatility, but is by no means guaranteed and may take a long time to play out,” analysts Mikhail Sprogis and Jeffrey Currie wrote.Goldman says such conditions will be a smaller drag on the price of gold as it is a “shorter duration real asset with developed user cases,” adding that the metal “may benefit from structurally higher macro volatility and a need to diversify equity exposure.”The cryptocurrency’s adoption has been boosted by easy financial conditions, the bank said, with some investors more willing to “explore low liquidity, high risk/return options like bitcoin.” With tighter financial conditions expected moving forward, speculative interest in bitcoin is likely to decline.Bitcoin is more levered to financial conditions than gold because the metal has “developed non-investment cases today while bitcoin is still looking for one,” the note said, adding that BTC is a “solution looking for a problem.” The majority of bitcoin supply has not moved for over a year, which suggests that it is being held for investment purposes, the note added.Read more: Goldman: Regulators Should Protect Crypto Investors at the Point of Trust, Not the Blockchain]"

Both benchmarks settled up more than 2% in the previous session.Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,796.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0550.Related ArticlesEuropean stock futures edge higher; U.S. inflation data in focusRolls-Royce shares fall after JPMorgan puts engine firm on negative catalyst watchMarketmind: Under arrest]"

It also held onto gains on the Australian dollar at $0.6756.Oil prices were higher after jumping on Monday due to supply jitters, with Brent crude futures up 0.28% at $78.21 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude up 0.51% at $73.54 a barrel.Spot gold was steady at $1,781.66 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures were up 0.1% at $1,793.40.(Reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)]"

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ETBitcoin Continues Its Side WaysBy James RubinA day before they will have a clearer view of the inflation landscape, investors had to reckon with the crypto industry's latest storm clouds: a report that Binance is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department probe, and later Monday, the arrest of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.Bitcoin tumbled below $16,900 at one point before recovering to recently trade at about $17,235, up slightly over the past 24 hours. BTC has spent much of the past two weeks clinging to support above $17,000 and seems likely to continue its tenacious ways for at least another day when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.Inflation has shown signs of continuing its downward trend of recent months. On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely drop its latest interest rate increase to 50 basis points (bps) from its current streak of 75 bps hikes, although markets are likely to remain nervously watchful for the time being.""It's a strong risk-off environment, not just in crypto but across every industry and in every country around the world,"" Hany Rashwan, CEO of 21.co, the parent company of crypto exchange-trading fund firm 21 Shares, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""The easiest way of thinking about this is [in] the last 10 years money has been cheaper to acquire, to borrow. As interest rates go up, the value of money becomes higher, so it becomes harder to get, and as a result people spend more carefully.""Story continuesYet, Rashwan added that his firm has ""been comforted internally by the plateauing of the bitcoin price within a specific band.""Ether followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, falling earlier in the day before rebounding. The second-largest crypto by market value was recently changing hands at about $1,275, a small gain from Sunday, same time. Most other major cryptos were in the green, with MATIC, the token of layer 2 platform Polygon, and SUSHI, the token of the Sushiswap decentralized exchange, recently rising about 2% and 1%, respectively.The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was recently up 0.23%.U.S. equity indexes closed in an upbeat mood about inflation and the Federal Reserve's expected dovish turn. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 rose 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively.Meanwhile, according to Reuters, the Justice Department has discussed possible plea deals with Binance's lawyers. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle began investigating Binance in 2018 after a spate of cases that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds, according to Reuters. Other prosecutors believe that more evidence needs to be gathered before a criminal case can be filed, causing a split within the Department of Justice.Late Monday, the Bahamian Attorney General's office announced the arrest of Bankman-Fried. ""SBF's arrest followed receipt of formal notification from the United States that it has filed criminal charges against SBF and is likely to request his extradition,"" the office wrote in a release. ""As a result of the notification received and the material provided therewith, it was deemed appropriate for the Attorney General to seek SBF's arrest and hold him in custody pursuant to our nation's Extradition Act.""Biggest GainersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorLoopringLRC+2.9%Smart Contract PlatformPolygonMATIC+2.0%Smart Contract PlatformTerraLUNA+1.7%Smart Contract PlatformBiggest LosersAssetTickerReturnsDACS SectorDogecoinDOGE−2.6%CurrencyDecentralandMANA−1.6%EntertainmentShiba InuSHIB−1.4%CurrencyInsightsGenesis Shakeout Will Determine When Crypto Can ReboundBy Sam ReynoldsEverything that could go wrong in crypto has gone wrong in crypto, QCP Capital’s founder and chief investment officer said during a panel at Taipei Blockchain Week. But there are still uses for the asset class, and ""green shoots"" are emerging.“We are in a credit crisis triggered by LUNA and UST,” QCP’s Darius Sit said on stage, referring to the Terra token and algorithmic stablecoin. “This means there are cascading effects on everyone that had credit risks, and there are still some landmines in the space.”Sit said that he sees a great reset and washout caused by the credit crisis, which won't end until investors see whether Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its Genesis Global Trading unit are going to collapse or stay together. (DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk).“If this comes apart, there’s another round of defaults,” he said.Sit pegs a recovery happening around 2024, but macroeconomics will also play a role in this. He noted that the most successful appreciation of digital asset prices came during the COVID-19 pandemic when the U.S. Fed was enlarging its balance sheet. But now the opposite is happening.As far as the use cases and green shoots go, Sit points to the strength of the stablecoin industry, which Sit says has record revenue. There’s also the continued institutional adoption of the crypto options and derivatives market, where QCP is the most active.“The trading teams are all former [foreign exchange] people,” Sit said.If there’s one thing that not even a “dot-com bubble and 2008” can change, it's that everyone is now talking about crypto, Sit said. Meaning, from the cab driver to the banker to the former FX people now trading crypto options and derivatives.

Boosting the indexes was a nearly 3% rise in shares of Microsoft Corp, following the software maker's plans to buy a stake in the London Stock Exchange Group .After a multi-week decline, oil prices also jumped as a key crude pipeline supplying the U.S. closed and Russia threatened a production cut, even as China's loosening COVID-19 restrictions bolstered the fuel demand outlook.The dollar was virtually flat in thin trading as investors awaited in the release of U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for November on Tuesday, when a slowdown in core annual inflation is anticipated.The MSCI all country stock index gained 0.55%, still down nearly 18% so far this year, wiping out all gains from 2021.In Europe, the STOXX index of 600 companies was down about 0.5% as investors awaited interest rate moves.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 1.3%, erasing some of the previous week's gains stemming from optimism that China is finally opening up its economy with the dismantling of its zero-COVID policy. Japan's Nikkei eased 0.2%.CENTRAL BANK WATCHEconomists expect the Fed on Wednesday, and the European Central Bank and Bank of England on Thursday, to all raise rates by 50 basis points - slowing down from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent meetings.Patrick Spencer, vice chair of equities at Baird investment bank, said central banks will start taking a less aggressive stance this week, though Tuesday's CPI data will be critical.Story continues""It's the last important week of the year, after this week you've got no real sort of catalysts. If the CPI is a muted number, we're off to the races and we'll get our year-end rally,"" Spencer said.But irrespective of the CPI, deflationary pressures are increasing, with crude oil prices down for the year, and iron ore, lumber and house prices also down, Spencer said.""All this talk of recession, I think it is certainly in the price, it's in the markets. The key about recession is generally employment, and I think employment is going to be stronger than people give it credit,"" Spencer said.While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday at its last meeting of 2022, the focus will also be on the central bank's updated economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.""This week's focus is likely to be centered on CPI and the Fed. To us, that is yesterday's news,"" Morgan Stanley market strategists wrote in a note on Monday.""While it's important for ... year-end trading ranges, the final chapter to this bear market is all about the path of earnings estimates, which are far too high, in our view.""DOLLAR MUTED, YIELDS EDGE UPU.S. Treasury yields rose slightly on Mondayahead of the Fed's next move.

Known for being a distressed-debt specialist, filings show the billionaire gurus firm focuses on investing in equities and debt of distressed companies, exchange warrants, options, futures notes and junk bonds.In 2019, Tepper converted the firm into a family office as a result of becoming the owner of the Carolina Panthers NFL football team.As of Dec. 12, the stocks Tepper holds that collapsed to near their lowest prices in a year were Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM).The third-quarter 13F filing showed the gurus equity portfolio consisted of 22 stocks as of the three months ended Sept. 30, which was valued at $1.36 billion. The holdings have posted somewhat mixed performances so far in 2022, with nine of the top 20 positions declining.2 David Tepper Stocks Are Trading Near 52-Week LowsInvestors should be aware 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firms holdings as the reports only include its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information. Further, the reports only reflect trades and holdings as of the most-recent portfolio filing date, which may or may not be held by the reporting firm today or even when this article was published.AmazonAmazons (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares have tumbled more than 45% over the past year.

GuruFocus estimates he has gained 35.48% on the investment so far, which is currently his third-largest position.2 David Tepper Stocks Are Trading Near 52-Week LowsThe Seattle-based e-commerce company, which also operates in cloud computing, online advertising, streaming and artificial intelligence, has a $903.46 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $88.71 on Monday with a price-earnings ratio of 81.25, a price-book ratio of 6.57 and a price-sales ratio of 1.82.The GF Score of 89 out of 100 suggests the company has good outperformance potential on the back of strong ratings for profitability and growth and middling marks for financial strength, momentum and GF Value.2 David Tepper Stocks Are Trading Near 52-Week LowsAlthough the company has issued new long-term debt in recent years, it is still manageable due to adequate interest coverage. The Altman Z-Score of 3.39 also indicates it is in good standing currently even though assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing. The weighted average cost of capital eclipses the return on invested capital, meaning it is struggling to create value as it grows.Amazon is also being supported by an expanding operating margin and returns on equity, assets and capital that are outperforming over half of its competitors. Further, the moderate Piotroski F-Score of 4 out of 9 indicates conditions are typical for a stable company. Due to a slowdown in revenue per share growth, however, the predictability rank of five out of five stars is on watch.

While it received high ranks for profitability and growth, the financial strength, GF Value and momentum ratings were more moderate.2 David Tepper Stocks Are Trading Near 52-Week LowsThe Altman Z-Score of 2.89 indicates the company is under some pressure since its assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing. Further, the WACC exceeds the ROIC by a wide margin, so it is struggling to create value.In addition to Salesforces operating margin declining, its returns are underperforming versus industry peers.

Yahoo Finance's health reporter Anjalee Khemlani is here with more on this, and she is joined by Geeta Nayyar, Salesforce chief medical officer. Anjalee, take it away.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Thank you, Jared, and welcome to the show, Geeta. Really great to have you on. Obviously, as Jared mentioned, looking at what the pandemic did for health care, we know that telehealth was the first sort of upheaval. But retail health really is an interesting point. You know, we've seen CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, just to name a few-- some of these players really getting bigger in the space of providing health care. And that introductory touchpoint may have been getting vaccines during the pandemic. So I want to start off there and just ask you, what do you think, going into 2023, we can expect as sort of the tail end of the COVID impact of this?GEETA NAYYAR: Well, Anjalee, first, thanks so much for having me on. And what I would say is that it's just the beginning. There has been nothing but a land grab. As you just mentioned, some of those big logos in the retail health space, and the genie cannot be put back in the bottle. Consumers are finding that everyday convenience converging with health care, and health care has been everything but convenient both during the pandemic and before it.So it's really blending that everyday convenience with that blood pressure check, with that glucose check, and with that pharmacist, that trusted pharmacist in the community that you can walk in any time and ask that question, as we've just lived through a really tough era of misinformation. So consumers are looking for that trusted community, that trusted place. And retailers are looking to build off of that convergence, but still sell that face cream. So while they're selling health care services, it really is about broadening their market share in retail.Story continuesANJALEE KHEMLANI: And I wanted to touch on the sentiment of that because as you pointed out, the trusting part. I think prior to the pandemic, we saw a lot of upturned noses, if you will, at the Minute Clinics and the like. And it seems like, based on a recent ""New England Journal of Medicine"" article, they saw a survey which showed that there seems to be increased positive sentiment for retail health. As you can see on your screen, 66% improved view of retail health, and 71% see it still as lower quality than primary care.So there's a shift. There has been some view of it as lower quality than providers, the normal doctor visit, and the global sentiment seems to be a little bit more positive than the US sentiment on it. So talk to me about that and how that really fares for the market for some of these major players.GEETA NAYYAR: Sure. So look, the retail environment is really the place you want to go to for your low acuity health care. So what do I mean by that? I'm a rheumatologist. I see lupus patients, rheumatoid arthritis patients. These are complicated chronic diseases. The retail health environment is not for those patients. It is, however, for that earache, that upper respiratory infection, that vaccine, that blood pressure check. So the really low acuity health care visit.And that everyday convenience can't be beaten, right? I would much rather have a consumer go into their local retailer, get their blood pressure checked, rather than ending up in the emergency room with a heart attack. So it is about the right place and the right time, but there is no doubt that the physical proximity of retailers helps enormously. About 90% of the population is within 10 miles of a Walmart. We simply cannot say that about primary care clinics.So while the quality of a provider visit might be higher, if it's not accessible and it's not convenient, patients aren't going there. And they're certainly not coming back, even if they went once. So it is really about that customer loyalty, and the retail market being built for customer loyalty and the health care market simply is not.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: How does telehealth fare in all of that? Do we still see a continuation of the momentum we saw last year?GEETA NAYYAR: So telehealth remains now a staple part of any visit. Customers have found, consumers have found that it's more convenient. Providers are seeing that they are able to integrate the right kind of visit for virtual care. But as my husband says, who's a bladder surgeon, bladder surgery still has to be done in the hospital. So you've got to-- and I say, not yet. Not-- maybe from the living room soon, right?So we're still learning as a health care industry, but the consumer has accepted telehealth as part of their everyday interaction with the health care system. And the convenience of doing it from your home, doing it from your office, or wherever you need it, is again unbeatable to when we think about the traditional way health care has been delivered in the past.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Speaking of that traditional way, let's talk about the providers, because that's a really key piece of this equation. How are they feeling about this shift in consumer sentiment, especially as more and more patients are being viewed as consumers?GEETA NAYYAR: Well, the heat is on, Anjalee. The heat is on. And providers that are smart are also investing in virtual care, virtual health technologies, and they're looking to partner. If you think about a long tail retail strategy or a long-term provider strategy, partnering with some of these retailers is really important. I mean, look at Best Buy and what Best Buy has done with their connected devices. They want to connect that back to the provider so the provider has a better 360 view of their patients.I'm all for it. The consumer is all for it. And we are living in a world that is really pushing the paradigm forward in health care. Consumers are saying, if it's not convenient, if it's not accessible, I'm simply not going to go to the doctor's office.ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Yeah, that's a really good point you brought up about Best Buy. Who knew we were-- we would be talking about that with relation to health care? Geeta Nayyar, chief medical officer of Salesforce. Thank you so much again for joining us today.]"

As the name suggests, this sector simply involves the transformation of traditional, analog sources of data or business processes into digital data and processes for a host of different benefits. It traces its way back to the 1950s when the semiconductor was invented and allowed the conversion of analog computing to digital computing. The next big shifts started to occur from the 1960s onward, with the introduction of computer aided design in manufacturing in the 70s. Before this, digital planning systems started to make their way across corporations as a method of letting them manage their inventory in the 1960s. From then on, these systems were expanded to also bring materials requirement planning (MRP) and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) to firms. All these were brought under the umbrella of what is now termed enterprise resource planning (ERP), a leading technology that continues to evolve today and is at the heart of what is termed a digital transformation.However, backend processes are not the only ones that have been digitally transformed.  The late 1990s were the era of the Internet, and naturally, this was blended with the newly set up ERP systems. This integration enabled firms to communicate with each other to share different information such as delivery status, order invoices, and demand forecasts. The latter is particularly important for avoiding the bullwhip effect, which is the result of a demand mismatch between two companies at different ends of the supply chain. Finally, another aspect of digital transformation is the digital storefront,  which allows companies to interact with customers over the Internet.Naturally, the vast scope and the countless benefits offered by digital transformation lead to some impressive market valuations. A fresh report from Polaris Market Research estimates that the industry was worth $588 billion in 2021. From then, until 2030, the research firm expects it to grow at a strong compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6% to be worth an estimated $3.7 trillion. Polaris Market further outlines that the healthcare segment was the largest portion of digital transformation in 2021, and North America was the dominating region.Story continuesToday's piece will focus on some leading digital transformation companies that offer their products and services in the segment. The top players are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom Inc.

56,42a6fdc9-6770-3dc7-b2f1-b811236b7ece,CRM,2022-12-13,3 Stocks You Should Not Avoid Despite Their Layoff Announcements,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-not-avoid-despite-141902940.html,1670854742,STORY,"['META', 'AMZN', 'CRM']","[U.S. companies are witnessing waning demand for their products and services as high inflationary pressure and rising interest rates have been hurting consumer spending. Moreover, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has further increased worries for investors about a global economic recovery.As a result, companies across various industries, including technology, retail, and media have either initiated layoffs or stalled hiring in the wake of a looming recession. Over the past few months, tech behemoths like Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN and Salesforce CRM have announced their layoff plans.Though a workforce-trimming strategy might hurt employer brand and employee morale, it is often a necessary evil that companies consider adopting to stay afloat during turbulent times. The layoffs announced by the aforementioned companies do not mean that they are in bad shape. These organizations are leaders in their respective niches. Therefore, it is wise to keep holding these stocks despite their unpopular workforce-trimming initiatives.Let us see why the three stocks could rebound once the macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds subside.Meta Platforms: In early November, the social media giant announced its plan to trim the global workforce count by 13%. The announcement came after the company reported dismal results for third-quarter 2022 wherein adjusted earnings plunged 49% and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well. Revenues managed to surpass the consensus mark but decreased 4.5% year over year.Meta is facing its worst downfall in many years, suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are affecting its advertising spending. Unfavorable forex, targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes, normalization of e-commerce after the pandemic peak and higher inflation are hurting Meta’s financials.However, it does not mean that investors should offload META stock. The company has carved out a lucrative niche in the realm of social networking market. Meta has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa.Story continuesOf all places, India deserves special mention in terms of user growth. The world’s second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for the company. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta. This is primarily due to a burgeoning well-educated middle class, increasing spending power and rapid adoption of smartphones in the country. Meta’s investment in Reliance Jio is a step toward gaining a significant footprint in the country.Moreover, once the global macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds subside, the company is likely to witness a strong rebound in advertising revenues, given its dominance in the social media market.Additionally, Meta is heavily investing in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which will help build the metaverse as a commercial virtual reality (VR) independent of the real world. The move will also help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company diversify its business and move away from being just a mere social media platform provider. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.VR technology is fast emerging as a lucrative business opportunity in which the company plans to invest more than $3 billion in the next 10 years. The company is investing heavily in developing a VR content ecosystem. The launch of VR headset, Rift and Oculus Quest, its first all-in-one headset with no wires and full freedom of movement, is a step forward toward that goal. The company also announced a multi-year partnership with Rayban-parent EssilorLuxottica.  The two companies, in collaboration, released a pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses in 2021. Meta also unveiled Project Aria, which will help it develop the first generation of wearable AR devices.The drastic decline in the share price has made the stock even more lucrative to hold on to for solid long-term gains. META stock has plunged 65.6% year to date and is currently trading at 67.1% lower than its 52-week high of $352.71. Moreover, the stock currently trades at a forward 12-month P/E multiple of 14.87, significantly lower than the one-year high of 24.96.Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and ConsensusMeta Platforms, Inc. Price and ConsensusMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. QuoteAmazon: Headcount reduction at the world’s largest e-commerce company has already started and the company’s CEO Andy Jassy stated in mid-November that layoffs would continue in the coming year too. This Seattle-based Zacks Rank #3 company reportedly intends to lay off about 10,000 employees across the entire company.Amazon’s move can be seen as rightsizing of workforce as the company had hired rapidly and expanded aggressively during the pandemic when people were needed to shop online only amid the lockdowns and social distancing measures. With the reopening of economies around the world, revenue growth of the e-commerce company has slowed down. Therefore, the headcount reduction strategy will help it in maintaining profitability.Additionally, the company’s strategy of diversifying its business across multiple areas, including smart devices and cloud infrastructure markets, will drive growth over the long run. Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo devices are going great guns and helping the company sell products and services. Artificial intelligence driven Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home, which has converted the nascent smart home market into a potential area of growth in a very short time. Moreover, the company is benefiting from an increasing number of Alexa compatible smart devices.Furthermore, Amazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of Amazon Web Services, driven by its strengthening cloud offerings, will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space. Even more encouraging is the fact that AWS generates much stronger margins than the traditional retail business, which should remain a positive for the company’s profitability as it continues to grow in the mix.A YTD decline of 46.6% in share price also makes Amazon a lucrative stock to hold on for long-term potential gains. Moreover, the stock is trading 48.8% lower than its 52-week high of $174.17. Additionally, it trades at forward 12-month P/E multiple of 58.64, significantly lower than the one-year high of 84.13.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteSalesforce: This cloud-based software solution provider revealed in early November that it has cut hundreds of jobs but claimed that the number is less than a thousand. However, a report by the online media company, Protocol, suggests that Salesforce’s job cut initiative would have affected as many as 2,500 workers.The company’s move could be in the wake of slowing down sales growth. In the latest reported quarterly results, the company reported revenue growth of around 14%, much less than the percentage growth in 20s or more witnessed over the past several quarters.We believe that macroeconomic headwinds are taking a toll on Salesforce’s financial results. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues as evident from Gartner’s latest report on IT spending. The research firm’s report highlights that 2022 IT spending growth will be much slower than 2021 due to spending cutbacks across devices, software, IT services and communication services areas.However, we believe that organizations will accelerate digital transformation and invest aggressively in adopting cloud-based solutions once the macroeconomic headwinds subside.Additionally, Salesforce headcount reduction plan could also be seen as a measure to reduce costs amid mounting pressure from activist investors to improve profitability. In October 2022, activist investor Starboard Value revealed buying a significant stake in Salesforce and advocated for an increased profit through cutting costs.Considering the company’s long-term growth potential along with efforts to improve profitability by reducing costs, it is advisable to investors to stay invested in this Zacks Rank #3 stock for long-term gains. Additionally, the stock has lost 48.4% of its market value YTD and currently trades 51.5% lower than the 52-week high of $270.56. Moreover, it trades at a 12-month P/E multiple of 23.67, significantly down from the one-year high of 120.70.Salesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc.

""So I figured out pretty quickly this was a widespread campaign.""The email is part of a new and previously unreported campaign by a suspected North Korean hacking group, according to the cybersecurity experts, five targeted individuals and emails reviewed by Reuters.The cybersecurity experts suspect the hackers are targeting people who are influential in foreign governments to better understand where Western policy is headed on North Korea.The hacking group, which researchers dubbed Thallium or Kimsuky, among other names, has long used “spear-phishing” emails that trick targets into giving up passwords or clicking attachments or links that load malware. Now, however, it also appears to simply ask researchers or other experts to offer opinions or write reports.According to emails reviewed by Reuters, among the other issues raised were China’s reaction in the event of a new nuclear test; and whether a ""quieter"" approach to North Korean ""aggression"" might be warranted.""The attackers are having a ton of success with this very, very simple method,"" said James Elliott of the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), who added that the new tactic first emerged in January. ""The attackers have completely changed the process.""Story continuesMSTIC said it had identified ""multiple"" North Korea experts who have provided information to a Thallium attacker account.A 2020 report by U.S. government cybersecurity agencies said Thallium has been operating since 2012 and ""is most likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.""Thallium has historically targeted government employees, think tanks, academics, and human rights organisations, according to Microsoft.""The attackers are getting the information directly from the horse's mouth, if you will, and they don't have to sit there and make interpretations because they're getting it directly from the expert,"" Elliott said.NEW TACTICSNorth Korean hackers are well-known for attacks netting millions of dollars, targeting Sony Pictures over a film seen as insulting to its leader, and stealing data from pharmaceutical and defence companies, foreign governments, and others.North Korea's embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment, but it has denied being involved in cyber crime.In other attacks, Thallium and other hackers have spent weeks or months developing trust with a target before sending malicious software, said Saher Naumaan, principal threat intelligence analyst at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.But according to Microsoft, the group now also engages with experts in some cases without ever sending malicious files or links even after the victims respond.This tactic can be quicker than hacking someone's account and wading through their emails, bypasses traditional technical security programmes that would scan and flag a message with malicious elements, and allows the spies direct access to the experts' thinking, Elliott said.""For us as defenders, it's really, really hard to stop these emails,"" he said, adding that in most cases it comes down to the recipient being able to figure it out.Town said some messages purporting to be from her had used an email address that ended in "".live"" rather than her official account, which ends in "".org"", but had copied her full signature line.In one case, she said, she was involved in a surreal email exchange in which the suspected attacker, posing as her, included her in a reply.DePetris, a fellow with Defense Priorities and a columnist for several newspapers, said the emails he has received were written as if a researcher were asking for a paper submission or comments on a draft.""They were quite sophisticated, with think tank logos attached to the correspondence to make it look as if the inquiry is legitimate,"" he said.About three weeks after receiving the faked email from 38 North, a separate hacker impersonated him, emailing other people to look at a draft, DePetris said.That email, which DePetris shared with Reuters, offers $300 for reviewing a manuscript about North Korea's nuclear programme and asks for recommendations for other possible reviewers. Elliot said the hackers never paid anyone for their research or responses, and would never intend to.GATHERING INFORMATIONImpersonation is a common method for spies around the world, but as North Korea's isolation has deepened under sanctions and the pandemic, Western intelligence agencies believe Pyongyang has become particularly reliant on cyber campaigns, one security source in Seoul told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.In a March 2022 report, a panel of experts that investigates North Korea's U.N. sanctions evasions listed Thallium's efforts as among activities that ""constitute espionage intended to inform and assist"" the country's sanctions avoidance.Town said in some cases, the attackers have commissioned papers, and analysts had provided full reports or manuscript reviews before realising what had happened.DePetris said the hackers asked him about issues he was already working on, including Japan's response to North Korea's military activities.Another email, purporting to be a reporter from Japan's Kyodo News, asked a 38 North staffer how they thought the war in Ukraine factored in North Korea's thinking, and posed questions about U.S., Chinese, and Russian policies.""One can only surmise that the North Koreans are trying to get candid views from think tankers in order to better understand U.S. policy on the North and where it may be going,"" DePetris said.(Reporting by Josh Smith.

Wall Street Analysts Think 25%,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-upside-left-signet-sig-145502206.html,1670856902,STORY,['SIG'],"[Signet (SIG) closed the last trading session at $68.27, gaining 3.3% over the past four weeks, but there could be plenty of upside left in the stock if short-term price targets set by Wall Street analysts are any guide. The mean price target of $85.50 indicates a 25.2% upside potential.The mean estimate comprises six short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $12.13. While the lowest estimate of $75 indicates a 9.9% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 53.8% to reach $105. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in SIG. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for SIGHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why SIG Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 5.3%.Moreover, SIG currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much SIG could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And we're leading with some news involving CVS and Walgreens. Both are up a little bit less than 2%. I'm going to put a one-year chart as I read you the news here.They've settled with various state attorneys general for $10.7 billion over their roles in the opioid crisis, of which CVS will pay $5 billion over 10 years, and Walgreens will pay $5.7 billion over 15 years. Both pharmacies agreed a court ordered relief requiring them to monitor, report, and share data about suspicious activity related to opioid prescriptions.And now moving along to the software space, I'm going to bring that up here. One of the little-- smaller names I should point out is Coupa Software. They are up 26% today. And that little dot right there is where they are in relation to their one-year chart. And this is fueling Coupa Software's rise to the top of Yahoo Finance's charts, trending tickers today.The accounting software company handily beat on both its top and bottom lines, but the big story is that the company may not be preparing too many more 10-Qs if the Thoma Bravo private bid for the company to the tune of $6.2 billion goes through as planned in the first half of 2022.Of the private equity deal to be paid in cash, Citigroup is saying, Coupa Brands-- a deliberate process with both strategic and financial parties before agreeing to the offer, suggesting limited risk of another betting offer coming in later. Also, Citigroup adding, $81 per share, that takeout may be lower than some shareholders wanted.And now to another partnership, this one involving the exchange space and a familiar name, Microsoft, one of our giant trending tickers here. And let me just put this in, and also, the London Stock Exchange. Now we don't talk about the LSE too much, but the news today is they may be giving into a Bloomberg competitor. It may be giving up some of those rights. A terminal run-- now that's kind of a pun on the Bloomberg business line. You can see London Stock Exchange, that is up 13% year over year.Story continuesNow, the exchange is selling a 4% stake to Microsoft, valued at $2 billion, and it will be licensing its data in the platform capabilities to the tech giant. These include those from the LSC's $27 billion purchase of Refinitiv last year. Microsoft will be weaving the data into its 365 and Team software, and it expects the deal to generate $5 billion over the next 10 years.So, Seana, not a lot of news, or I guess, second day news on this today. We kind of got the story overnight there. But I will say it's kind of a big deal. You think about Bloomberg competitors. Maybe Microsoft and Refinitiv, through the London Stock Exchange, have the ante here.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, you know what's also interesting, just from a regulatory perspective as well, right, kind of this blurring line between big tech and banks and exchanges in this case. And it's not something that we haven't seen before because last year, Google [INAUDIBLE] had a partnership, they reached a partnership. And NASDAQ and Amazon reached a partnership.But from a regulatory perspective, I would think that a deal like this would likely be scrutinized, given the fact that now we're seeing kind of those boundaries being blurred just a bit.JARED BLIKRE: We'll have to see. We know big tech has been in the forefront here, especially in antitrust regulators' headlights here. But I don't know that exchange data, especially through this Refinitiv purchase when Microsoft really doesn't have a direct line of business into that kind of line of business. I don't know if the regulators are going to get involved, but they're always up Microsoft [INAUDIBLE].SEANA SMITH: Yeah, or the fact that they're relying on just only a few cloud providers out there, but it's going to be interesting. But certainly a deal to note today. All right--]"

The repurchase is being done in concurrence with Walgreens Boots Alliance’s WBA sale of AmerisourceBergen shares pursuant to Rule 144 — a rule that provides an exemption and permits the public resale of restricted or control securities if several conditions are met.Please note that Walgreens Boots Alliance owns the retail pharmacy chains Walgreens and Boots and several pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution companies. The company is the largest shareholder in AmerisourceBergen. Per a Reuters article, Walgreens Boots Alliance has sold nearly 3% stake in AmerisourceBergen, bringing down its total stake to approximately 17%, for proceeds of $1 billion. AmerisourceBergen’s share repurchase is in concurrence with the recent WBA’s stake sale.AmerisourceBergen stated that the shares that will be repurchased in concurrence with WBA’s stake sale would be held in treasury. The share sale will not impact on the long-term partnership between the two companies, per Walgreens Boots Alliance’s management.The proceeds from Walgreens Boots Alliance’s stake sale in ABC will likely be used to pay down debt and to fund strategic priorities, including the acquisition of urgent care provider — Summit Health — by Walgreens-backed VillageMD for $9 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe note that shares of AmerisourceBergen have rallied 24.4% so far this year, creating wealth for its investors, including Walgreens Boots Alliance. Share of ABC touched an all-time high earlier this month before a small decline last week. The recent rally, taking the company’s share to its highest level ever, is likely to continue next year on the back of its strong business segments, especially the World Courier business. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 performance and strength in its U.S. healthcare solutions business are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and headwinds from contract renewals persist.Story continuesInvestors are upbeat about World Courier’s solid foothold in global specialty logistics services, which has been driving compelling volume growth and overall performance for ABC. The business has been delivering robust results in recent times and the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 was no exception.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Starbucks’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Starbucks Is Starbucks Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 15.42% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Starbucks today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $88.19, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. What's more, Starbucks’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Starbucks look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Starbucks' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 58%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SBUX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SBUX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Starbucks at this point in time.

Bloomberg reporting that Goldman Sachs could be cutting at least 400 jobs from its consumers business. Now this comes as the big bank looks to restructure that division. Now the report also stating that Goldman is, quote, turning off a checking account product that was in beta testing.And Pras, this comes after Goldman's headcount has really swelled over the last several years, up 34%. Since the end of 2018 to 2022 has certainly been a very challenging time for the company. We've heard CEO David Solomon say numerous times over the last several months that it's been tough here for Goldman Sachs. It's going to continue to be tough, given the macroeconomic backdrop right now, and that cuts could be necessary. So I don't think this is necessarily a huge surprise here to the Street.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Plus, with Wall Street, they're the ones that are sort of first to kind of cut-- trim the fat, if you will, when times are going to-- expected to come in a little bit tight. Their consumer bank was a-- it's a tricky business, one that they've been trying to get into for a while. It was called markets before, and they changed the name to that. And it's been, I guess, struggling with regards to acquiring consumers there for those banking operations.One thing I'll note is that Solomon has not been shy about talking about wanting to trim the fat. I think he said in a conference last week that they're watching every operation to be nimble when they can be and cut when they have to. So I'm not surprised that he's really thinking about doing that right now, especially in that consumer banking division.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, I think the-- I don't know that Goldman Sachs really wanted to be in the consumer loan business to begin with. There was an article I was reading where you got these people in court chasing down people who had welched on loans. Well, small businesses are not the normal client base for Goldman Sachs, although they are the business engine of America.Story continuesSo I'm not surprised to see Goldman exiting a few of those bets. And in the tech world, tech overhired to a huge degree-- not the same degree that finance did, but-- and as much as finance wants to be fintech and wants to incorporate a lot of that into their business, I'm not surprised that they overhired as well. And so I think they're just coming kind of back to reality, to a more normal beat here. I wouldn't read too much into these layoffs as above and beyond the norm.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly, and put at 400 headcounts, not diminishing-- or I guess, what shall I say? Not, I guess, discounting this at all, but 400 headcounts and 400 jobs in relative to their total headcount is a very small portion of Goldman Sachs' business.And it's also important to point out that this is in addition to Goldman Sachs' annual trimming that they do every year of underperformers. So this additional Bloomberg report of 400 jobs being cut from the consumer division is in addition to what the big banks typically do-- typical cuts at the end of each year.JARED BLIKRE: Right.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Which they-- sorry.JARED BLIKRE: Good.]"

FLT.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027768/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-despite-industry-woesThe Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to benefit from the growing adoption of digital means – a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Though improved consumer spending and rebounding travel remain underway, the optimistic scenario might be strained by the continued impact of inflation.Elevated technology investments in order to sustain one’s market position remain a significant challenge for financial transaction services providers. Despite such headwinds, companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. are placed well to counter the industry headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Influencing the Financial Transaction Services Industry's FutureSevere Competition Compelling Heavy Technology Investments: The Financial Transaction Services space witnesses intensifying competition as a result of which industry players are compelled to undertake significant technology investments. The ongoing trend to go digital has triggered the need to opt for investments in order to upgrade one’s digital capabilities. But rolling out advanced digital payment solutions is not adequate, as increased digitization often gives rise to sophisticated forms of cybercrimes.Story continuesTherefore, the industry players also need to undertake investments for equipping themselves with enhanced fraud detection solutions. An elevated expense level might hamper margins of the industry players.M&amp;A Strategy Under Pressure: Players of the Financial Transaction Services space frequently resort to a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy for bolstering capabilities, bringing diversification benefits, expanding global presence and increasing the customer base. However, per S&amp;P Global, M&amp;A activity has been on a downtrend this year and shows no signs of a sharp turnaround in the near term.The Fed’s frequent rate hikes in order to counter inflationary headwinds stir volatility in equity markets. As a result, the purchasing power of consumers suffered a blow. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of financing, which makes businesses reluctant to pursue M&amp;A deals.Better Consumer Spending &amp; Rebounding Travel: Consumer spending seems not to have been much affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ first estimate of third-quarter 2022 Gross Domestic Product. This brings a ray of hope for financial transaction services stocks since the transaction volumes of these players depend, to a large extent, on consumer spending.Even amid the ongoing pressure of inflation, substantial personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a cushion, facilitating continued consumer spending. With border restrictions lifted and the pandemic becoming the new normal of life, individuals have resumed traveling. However, the future of consumer spending looks uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature of inflation and looming recession fears.Growing Adoption of Contactless Payment Methods: The pandemic-induced shift toward contactless payments proved to be a boon for not only consumers but for financial transaction services players as well.

91,f9fa1cee-fa7c-3538-9540-fb5a6b757a71,SLB,2022-12-13,There's Been No Shortage Of Growth Recently For Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-no-shortage-growth-recently-130008307.html,1670936408,STORY,['SLB'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Schlumberger is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$44b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 11%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 7.0% generated by the Energy Services industry. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Schlumberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Schlumberger here  for free.So How Is Schlumberger's ROCE Trending?You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Schlumberger. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 166% over the trailing five years. The company is now earning US$0.1 per dollar of capital employed. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 46% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. If this trend continues, the business might be getting more efficient but it's shrinking in terms of total assets.Story continuesOur Take On Schlumberger's ROCEIn a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Schlumberger has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. Given the stock has declined 11% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing.

(HOLX) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-hologic-inc-140002670.html,1670853602,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Hologic (HOLX) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this medical device maker have returned -2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Hologic falls in, has gained 12.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Hologic is expected to post earnings of $0.87 per share, indicating a change of -59.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -42.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.90 indicates a change of +12.5% from what Hologic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Hologic is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for HOLX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Hologic, the consensus sales estimate of $962.24 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -34.6%. The $3.81 billion and $4.04 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -21.6% and +5.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryHologic reported revenues of $953.3 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -27.6%. EPS of $0.82 for the same period compares with $1.61 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $866.83 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.98%. The EPS surprise was +32.26%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Hologic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Hologic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At one point a siren went off. Letterman looked alarmed, but no one else reacted. What did that indicate, he asked?""Unfortunately it means that war has become a habit,"" said Zelenskiy. ""Many Ukrainians have gotten used to it... To me sirens are an indicator that war is not over... this is a reminder that somewhere, someone is giving up their life for yours.""In February, Russia sent troops into Ukraine in what it called a ""special operation"" to degrade its southern neighbor's military capabilities and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists.

He discussed with Zelenskiy, a former comedian, the importance of humor in dark times, and chatted with him about his family.It was only in speaking to his wife and children that he could breathe, said the Ukrainian leader.""Children know much more about the war than we do.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Story continuesNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock.

We have Horizon Therapeutics, Coinbase, and DraftKings. My play today, Amgen buying Horizon Therapeutics for nearly $28 billion, its biggest buyout ever. Now, the move pushing Amgen further into immune therapies, giving it a chance to build its portfolio of treatments at a time when many of its top drugs face a loss of patent protection in the coming years.Amgen paying 1,650 a share for Horizon Therapeutics. Jared, this was actually the largest healthcare merger of the year. So ending the year on a positive note if we can say that, one of the big M&amp;A deals today. So I guess a bit of optimism here as we close out what has been a very, very tough year for the markets and a lot of healthcare companies.JARED BLIKRE: I'll tell you what. I don't comment on the fundamentals of these biotech deals because most of the time, I can't even pronounce the names of the drugs or studies involved. I will comment on this chart. So Horizon Therapeutics, over the last three months, up 68%. And a lot of that premium being built in today.I'll just show you a chart over the last three years. You can see it's been kind of a whirlwind. So it was up quite a bit into the end of 2021, and then reached their low in the middle of 2022 and have come off quite markedly from that low. So could be a decent buy here for Amgen. Again, not commenting on the fundamentals of that deal.]"

After a brutal bear market, an economic slowdown, or a recession takes place, an influx of mergers and acquisitions is one sign that business is picking up again. Why is this? When a larger company acquires a smaller company, the larger company must have the following:1.   The cash or stock on hand to complete the deal.2.   A risk-on, growth mindset, rather than a defensive mindset.3.   An idea that economy has turned or will be healthy enough to sustain the thought process behind the deal.“Merger Monday” is a term used on Wall Street to label the tendency for companies to announce large deals at the start of the week. Today, details of two potential mega-deals were announced. Horizon Therapeutics HZNPAmgen Inc (AMGN), a $147 billion-dollar therapeutic company, is embarking on its largest acquisition, Ireland-based Horizon Therapeutics HZNP. While the acquisition news is not a huge surprise, there were some twists and turns in the road before the deal was agreed upon. Unless the agreement changes last minute, Amgen will buy Horizon for a whopping $26 billion or $116.50 a share (shares closed at $97 Friday).Late last month, Zacks reported that Horizon held preliminary discussions with industry giants Sanofi (SNY), Johnson and Johnson JNJ, and Amgen. The interest from three of the biotech industry’s juggernauts sent shares of Horizon jumping 27% last month. Eventually, Sanofi and Johnson and Johnson backed out of the deal due to valuation concerns, leaving the door open for Amgen.Both Horizon and Amgen have had positive momentum in recent years. In early 2020, the FDA approved Horizon’s biggest drug, Tepezza, a treatment for thyroid eye disease. Meanwhile, Amgen’s deep pipeline of drugs has propelled the company to earn billions in profits and outperform most of its peers. Amgen and Horizon are members of the Medical – Biomedical and Genetics Group, a top 22% Zacks ranked group.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: AMGN (green) &amp; HZNP (blue) have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year. Coupa Software COUPPrivate equity giant Thoma Bravo sees the recent tech crisis as an opportunity. Earlier today, Coupa Software (COUP) announced that Thoma Bravo would purchase the company for 6.15 billion in cash or a 30% premium to last week’s close.

As recent geopolitical flashpoints demonstrated, access to critical resources is just as important as the end products they help facilitate.Moving forward, securing supply chains to important industrial and agricultural material will likely take a priority. Therefore, even with the equities sector absorbing a beating, investors should plan ahead with the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023. Quite simply, this segment commands demand structures that probably won’t ever be replaced.BHPBHP Group$63.98RIORio Tinto$72.49VALEVale$16.94NEMNewmont Corp.$46.40WPMWheaton Precious Metals$38.99BGBunge$95.51MOSMosaic$46.81InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockBased in Australia, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is a multinational metal and mining specialist. In addition, the company produces natural gas and petroleum products, affording it an all-in-one business structure. At time of writing, BHP features a market capitalization of approximately $158 billion. On a year-to-date basis, BHP gained nearly 18%, storming above this year’s volatile market sessions.Fundamentally, BHP brings myriad relevancies to the table. In particular, its production of copper may help undergird the global electric vehicle rollout. According to a report by CME Group, EVs “use more than double the copper of an internal combustion engine automobile, and the metal is also used heavily in EV infrastructure.”In a way, BHP enjoys a double whammy, serving both the mobility units as well as the charging platform. Therefore, it deserves serious consideration among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023.Rio Tinto (RIO)a cart filed with gold in a gold mineSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in London, U.K., Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) bills itself as a leading global mining group that focuses on finding, mining and processing the Earth’s mineral resources. Presently, Rio Tinto commands a market cap of almost $118 billion. Since the start of the year, RIO returned shareholders roughly 8%. Most of this dynamism came recently, with shares up 20% in the trailing month.Story continuesBolstering enthusiasm for the mining specialist is its myriad product segments. As with rival BHP, Rio Tinto represents a major producer of copper, which will serve the electrification of mobility. In addition, RIO will likely benefit from its lithium business. At the moment, the U.S. and western forces tightly contest China’s dominance in this sector. Should EVs blossom, expect RIO to corral substantial demand.Another factor boosting the company’s candidacy among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 centers on the financials. Rio Tinto enjoys excellent profit margins across the board. In addition, its return on equity – a measure of how efficiently an enterprise converts equity funding to earnings – pings at 35.3%. This exceeds nearly 96% of industry competitors.Vale (VALE)Source: ShutterstockEasily representing one of the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023, Vale (NYSE:VALE) deserves more credit than its receiving. A Brazilian multinational corporation focusing on metals and mining, it’s possible that underlying political volatility detracted from Vale’s investment proposition. Nevertheless, the company has been a strong performer in 2022, returning 19% YTD.In particular, investors ought to consider Vale as one of the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 because of its nickel production. Per its corporate profile, the company represents the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world. Moving forward, nickel will almost surely undergird several industries of tomorrow.Per the Nickel Institute, the advantage of the namesake metal is that it “helps deliver higher energy density and greater storage capacity at a lower cost.” If EVs were to change mobility through economies of scale, nickel – through its integration in advanced battery technologies – will play a significant role.Newmont (NEM)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Denver, Colorado, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) initially presents a risky proposition among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023. As the world’s largest gold mining firm, Newmont would ordinarily command significant relevance. It still does but recent macroeconomic headwinds pose challenges to the underlying market.As the New York Times mentioned, the November jobs report came in much hotter than expected. Again, ordinarily, this news would spark optimism for the economy. However, it also means that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to contain inflation via raising the benchmark interest rate did little. Therefore, the central bank must take the gloves off. Unfortunately for NEM, this circumstance suggests even higher rate hikes next year.Still, the average spot gold price at time of writing sits just under $1,800. It’s quite possible that the fear trade inspired investors to bid up the yellow metal. In turn, Newmont may enjoy a surprising tailwind. Thus, while NEM is down nearly 23% YTD, don’t be surprised to see it rise again in 2023.Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Macro of silverSource: Phawat / Shutterstock.comFor investors that have strong confidence in the fear trade thesis, they may want to consider adding Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) to their list of best commodity stocks to buy for 2023. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wheaton currently commands a market cap of nearly $18 billion. Further, WPM lost only 5.5% YTD, beating out both the benchmark equities index and many other precious metal miners.Fundamentally, Wheaton offers greater predictability because of its streaming business model. Under such an arrangement, a company makes a deal with a mining firm to purchase all or a part of the metal production at a predetermined discounted price. On paper, it’s a symbiotic relationship: miners receive upfront capital while the streaming enterprises can profit off discounted commodities.What also makes Wheaton intriguing is its exposure to the silver market. While both gold and silver feature monetary and industrial applications, silver features heavily in the latter component. As the best electrical and thermal conductor of all metals, silver is essentially permanently relevant.Bunge (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comHeadquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Bunge (NYSE:BG) is an agribusiness and food company. One of its main businesses involves international soybean exports. In addition, Bunge is involved in food processing, grain trading and fertilizer. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $14.3 billion. Since the beginning of the year, BG gained nearly 3%.While it’s not pleasant to dive into cynical arguments for the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023, Bunge aligns with harsh realities. According to the World Food Programme, the global food crisis reached unprecedented proportions. Specifically, conflict, climate shocks and the coronavirus converged to form a massive headwind in terms of feeding world populations.Like it or not, BG will likely rise in demand based on sheer pertinence and necessity. On a more positive note, the market prices BG at only 8-times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 15.8 times. Therefore, it’s one of the more undervalued ideas among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023.Mosaic (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBased in Tampa, Florida, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) mines phosphate, potash, and collects urea for fertilizer  through various international distribution networks. Per its public profile, Mosaic represents the largest producer of potash and phosphate fertilizer in the U.S. Due to exceptional relevance, MOS gained nearly 17% since its Jan. opener. However, in the trailing month, MOS dipped 5%, affording contrarians a discounted opportunity heading into the new year.Fundamentally, Mosaic ranks among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 based on critical need. Back in September 2020, a report published on Nature.com warned that soil erosion could aggravate the global phosphate shortage. Today, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses severe challenges for the broader fertilizer market.Again, it’s a cynical talking point yet it also speaks to harsh, unavoidable realities. On a financial note, Mosaic enjoys strong profit margins along with a return on equity of over 33%, reflecting a high-quality business. Finally, the market prices MOS at 4.9-times forward earnings, which is conspicuously undervalued.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

While the consumer price index (CPI), which is due at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT), is expected to show that inflation eased further in November, markets are wary of any unexpected strength in the reading.The U.S. producer price index, which gauges manufacturing inflation, eased less than expected in November, raising fears of a similar trend in the CPI.Spot gold was flat at $1,782.17 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,793.10 an ounce. Both instruments sank over 1% on Monday.A stronger-than-expected inflation reading is likely to elicit a hawkish response from the Federal Reserve - a move that could push up the dollar and Treasury yields while heralding more pressure on metal markets. The greenback steadied above a five-month low on Tuesday.While the central bank is set to hike interest rates by 50 basis points at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, its guidance on where interest rates will peak will be closely watched. The Fed hiked rates by a total 375 bps this year, which weighed heavily on gold by driving up the opportunity cost of holding the yellow metal.While the central bank signaled it will raise interest rates at a slower pace in the coming months, it also warned that interest rates could peak at much higher levels if inflation shows little signs of easing.Other precious metals were mildly positive on Tuesday after logging sharp losses in the prior sessions. Platinum futures rose 0.1%, while silver futures added 0.5%.Among industrial metals, copper prices edged higher after falling sharply in the prior session.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $3.8137 a pound, recovering from a 1% drop.The red metal is expected to see volatile trade in the coming weeks amid uncertainty over how major importer China will carry out an economic reopening from nearly three years of COVID lockdowns.While the country relaxed several movement and quarantine measures, it is still coping with its worst ever outbreak.Related ArticlesGold nurses sharp losses as U.S. CPI report, Fed meeting loomAs Russia pounds Ukraine civil infrastructure, powers meet to provide aidU.S. sends first shipment of power gear to aid Ukraine]"

Demonstrators have taken to the streets to demand that Peru hold new elections, with some also calling for Congress to be shuttered and Castillo released.The head of the Peru ombudsman's office, Eliana Revollar, said seven people had died during two days of protests, all from gunshot wounds.Authorities in Apurimac had earlier Monday reported the death of a 16-year-old and two 18-year-olds, while another death was reported in Arequipa and two teenagers were killed on Sunday.""These are really are needless deaths,"" Revollar told local broadcaster Epicentro, adding that at least 32 civilians and 24 police had been injured.Citing ""difficult times,"" Peru's sixth president in the past five years said she was proposing to move up the next general election to April 2024. It was previously scheduled for 2026.In a handwritten letter posted to his Twitter page on Monday, Castillo called Boluarte's early election pledge a ""dirty game"" and derided her as a ""usurper,"" calling for an immediate assembly to rewrite the nation's constitution.Castillo also said he would not resign as president despite his lawful removal from power. He is being held in a penitentiary center in Lima while he is being investigated by prosecutors for the alleged crimes of rebellion and conspiracy.The leftist governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico and Colombia issued a joint statement on Monday calling for the protection of Castillo's human and judicial rights, adding that the ""agents"" of Castillo's removal should prioritize ""the will of the citizens that was declared at the polls.""Story continuesCastillo was elected by a narrow margin last year with Boluarte as his running mate.Some civil and indigenous groups in the world's No. 2 copper producer also announced a strike starting on Monday in Apurimac, home to significant mining projects including Las Bambas, a major copper mine owned by China's MMG Ltd.A source at Las Bambas, which has battled blockades for years, told Reuters it has received more blockade threats amid a ""radicalization"" of protests against the firm by locals.'HIGH CONFLICT'A former teacher and peasant farmer, Castillo attracted strong support last year from rural and mining areas. But during the first year of his administration, corruption allegations against him mounted while he presided over unprecedented turnover among senior ministers.Protests involving hundreds or thousands of people have been held since last week in cities in Peru's interior and capital Lima, at times turning violent.The U.N. Human Rights Office warned of further escalation in a statement on Monday, calling on authorities to exercise restraint and fully investigate the deaths of protesters.In Apurimac, authorities ordered the airport's closure after an attack by protesters, and parts of Peru's main coastal highway was blocked on Monday in Ica and Arequipa.LATAM Airlines said it had canceled flights to and from the city of Arequipa after reports protesters invaded a runway.""Dina Boluarte doesn't represent us. She's a traitor. She's incompetent,"" said Juan Calle at a march in Lima, calling on the new president to be jailed and Castillo released.Boluarte, 60, declared a state of emergency in areas of ""high conflict,"" allowing soldiers to take more control.""I have given the instructions so that control of internal order can be recovered peacefully, without affecting the people's fundamental rights,"" said Boluarte, who lamented the deaths.(Reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Anthony Esposito and Sarah Morland; Editing by Alistair Bell and Rosalba O'Brien)]"

The award has been offered by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C.Details of the DealValued at $328.5 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Sep 30, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide Strategic Weapon System Trident Fleet support, Trident II Shipboard Integration Increment 8 and navigation subsystem development efforts.The contract will serve the United States and United Kingdom. The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in Mitchel Field, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin is a prime defense contractor for defense arsenals and ammunition. It enjoys a lucrative position in manufacturing military missiles. In this context, its Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of the U.S. Navy's submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, following the highly successful Polaris, Poseidon and Trident I C4 programs.Trident II (D5) is a three-stage, solid-propellant, inertial-guided ballistic missile developed by Lockheed Martin. The missile can carry multiple independently targeted reentry bodies for a maximum range of more than 7,360 km. The missile cannot be tracked when it is being operated as it has a sea-based deterrent.Such remarkable features must have boosted its demand in the military landscape. Its strong demand can be gauged from 14 U.S. Navy Ohio-class submarines with American warheads and four Royal Navy Vanguard-class submarines with British warheads equipped with this missile. The latest contract win is a bright example of the solid demand that the Trident missile enjoys in the defense market.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.9% during the 2022-2027 period. Such an expanding market size is likely to benefit LMT as it enjoys a solid position in the military missile market.Story continuesPeer GrowthProminent defense majors that have been manufacturing missiles for the defense industry and are likely to enjoy the perks of increased demand are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%. NOC’s investors have gained 40.2% in the past year.Raytheon Technologies’ RTX Missiles &amp; Defense is a leading designer, developer, integrator, producer and sustainer of integrated air and missile defense systems.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, The AES Corp. AES, NRG Energy Inc. NRG, NiSource Inc. NI and PPL Corp. PPL.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Utility Stocks to Stay Safe in a Likely Volatile WeekWe are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.9%, 17.5% and 29.7%, respectively. Fluctuations in the market are also likely this week as the decision regarding the next round of interest rate hike will come on Dec 14, after the conclusion of the Fed FOMC meeting.Moreover, several major economic data of November such as, consumer price index, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization will be released this week. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthened your portfolio. We have selected five utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are - American Electric Power Co. Inc., The AES Corp.,NRG Energy Inc., NiSource Inc. and PPL Corp.Utilities Immune to the Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Story continuesConsequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Year to date, out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, 10 are in negative territory, except the energy sector. Of these 10 sectors, utilities suffered the least. The utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) dropped marginally by 1.1%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, NRG Energy is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while OGE Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that NRG's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is NRG Energy (NRG). NRG is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 7.64, which compares to its industry's average of 15.44. NRG's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.06 and as low as 4.45, with a median of 8.56, all within the past year.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is NRG's P/B ratio of 1.48. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.23. Within the past 52 weeks, NRG's P/B has been as high as 2.93 and as low as 1.48, with a median of 1.96.Investors could also keep in mind RWE AG (RWEOY), an Utility - Electric Power stock with a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and Value grade of A.Shares of RWE AG are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 10.22 and a PEG ratio of 7.05 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 15.44 and 2.24, respectively.Story continuesRWEOY's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 20.53 and as low as 8.72, with a median of 17.44, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 7.65 and as low as 2.45, with a median of 4.01, all within the past year.RWE AG sports a P/B ratio of 2.97 as well; this compares to its industry's price-to-book ratio of 2.23.

120,97268e8a-686d-3a23-a303-bfc2a47e9367,NRG,2022-12-13,Top 5 Utility Stocks to Stay Safe in a Likely Volatile Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-utility-stocks-stay-130601346.html,1670850361,STORY,"['AES', 'NIMC', 'AESC', 'PPL', 'NRG']","[We are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.9%, 17.5% and 29.7%, respectively. Fluctuations in the market are also likely this week as the decision regarding the next round of interest rate hike will come on Dec 14, after the conclusion of the Fed FOMC meeting.Moreover, several major economic data of November such as, consumer price index, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization will be released this week. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthened your portfolio. We have selected five utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are - American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, The AES Corp. AES, NRG Energy Inc. NRG NiSource Inc. NI and PPL Corp. PPL.Utilities Immune to the Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Story continuesUtility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Year to date, out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, 10 are in negative territory, except the energy sector. Of these 10 sectors, utilities suffered the least. The utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) dropped marginally by 1.1%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. FLT.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027768/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-despite-industry-woesThe Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to benefit from the growing adoption of digital means – a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Though improved consumer spending and rebounding travel remain underway, the optimistic scenario might be strained by the continued impact of inflation.Elevated technology investments in order to sustain one’s market position remain a significant challenge for financial transaction services providers. Despite such headwinds, companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. are placed well to counter the industry headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Influencing the Financial Transaction Services Industry's FutureSevere Competition Compelling Heavy Technology Investments: The Financial Transaction Services space witnesses intensifying competition as a result of which industry players are compelled to undertake significant technology investments. The ongoing trend to go digital has triggered the need to opt for investments in order to upgrade one’s digital capabilities. But rolling out advanced digital payment solutions is not adequate, as increased digitization often gives rise to sophisticated forms of cybercrimes.Story continuesTherefore, the industry players also need to undertake investments for equipping themselves with enhanced fraud detection solutions. An elevated expense level might hamper margins of the industry players.M&amp;A Strategy Under Pressure: Players of the Financial Transaction Services space frequently resort to a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy for bolstering capabilities, bringing diversification benefits, expanding global presence and increasing the customer base. However, per S&amp;P Global, M&amp;A activity has been on a downtrend this year and shows no signs of a sharp turnaround in the near term.The Fed’s frequent rate hikes in order to counter inflationary headwinds stir volatility in equity markets. As a result, the purchasing power of consumers suffered a blow. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of financing, which makes businesses reluctant to pursue M&amp;A deals.Better Consumer Spending &amp; Rebounding Travel: Consumer spending seems not to have been much affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ first estimate of third-quarter 2022 Gross Domestic Product. This brings a ray of hope for financial transaction services stocks since the transaction volumes of these players depend, to a large extent, on consumer spending.Even amid the ongoing pressure of inflation, substantial personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a cushion, facilitating continued consumer spending. With border restrictions lifted and the pandemic becoming the new normal of life, individuals have resumed traveling. However, the future of consumer spending looks uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature of inflation and looming recession fears.Growing Adoption of Contactless Payment Methods: The pandemic-induced shift toward contactless payments proved to be a boon for not only consumers but for financial transaction services players as well. With cash and checks taking a backseat, several flexible digital payment options such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, QR code and buy now, pay later (BNPL) option came to the forefront. While affordability and ease of digital payments were benefits to consumers, the industry players were aided by steady and diversified revenue streams.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Drab ProspectsThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have declined 6.9% over the past year.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has lost 17.1% compared with the Business Services sector’s decline of 39.1%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.3% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, commonly used for valuing financial transaction services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 20.69X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.49X and the sector’s 24.43X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 26X, as low as 17.73X and at the median of 21.92X.5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting five stocks from the Financial Transaction Services industry that currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to retain these stocks in their portfolio, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Visa: Based in San Francisco, Visa is one of the world leaders in digital payments.

124,61bf5007-f573-3a8a-8541-bd0d44ca2193,SPGI,2022-12-13,5 Financial Transaction Stocks in Focus Despite Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-focus-154803479.html,1670860083,STORY,"['GPN', 'SPGI', 'V', 'MA', 'FLT', 'FISV']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to benefit from the growing adoption of digital means – a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Though improved consumer spending and rebounding travel remain underway, the optimistic scenario might be strained by the continued impact of inflation. Elevated technology investments in order to sustain one’s market position remain a significant challenge for financial transaction services providers. Despite such headwinds, companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. FLT are placed well to counter the industry headwinds.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Influencing the Financial Transaction Services Industry's FutureSevere Competition Compelling Heavy Technology Investments: The Financial Transaction Services space witnesses intensifying competition as a result of which industry players are compelled to undertake significant technology investments. The ongoing trend to go digital has triggered the need to opt for investments in order to upgrade one’s digital capabilities. But rolling out advanced digital payment solutions is not adequate, as increased digitization often gives rise to sophisticated forms of cybercrimes. Therefore, the industry players also need to undertake investments for equipping themselves with enhanced fraud detection solutions. An elevated expense level might hamper margins of the industry players.Story continuesM&amp;A Strategy Under Pressure: Players of the Financial Transaction Services space frequently resort to a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy for bolstering capabilities, bringing diversification benefits, expanding global presence and increasing the customer base. However, per S&amp;P Global, M&amp;A activity has been on a downtrend this year and shows no signs of a sharp turnaround in the near term. The Fed’s frequent rate hikes in order to counter inflationary headwinds stir volatility in equity markets. As a result, the purchasing power of consumers suffered a blow. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of financing, which makes businesses reluctant to pursue M&amp;A deals.Better Consumer Spending &amp; Rebounding Travel: Consumer spending seems not to have been much affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ first estimate of third-quarter 2022 Gross Domestic Product. This brings a ray of hope for financial transaction services stocks since the transaction volumes of these players depend, to a large extent, on consumer spending. Even, amid the ongoing pressure of inflation, substantial personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a cushion, facilitating continued consumer spending. With border restrictions lifted and the pandemic becoming the new normal of life, individuals have resumed traveling. However, the future of consumer spending looks uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature of inflation and looming recession fears.Growing Adoption of Contactless Payment Methods: The pandemic-induced shift toward contactless payments proved to be a boon for not only consumers but for financial transaction services players as well. With cash and checks taking a backseat, several flexible digital payment options such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, QR code and buy now, pay later (BNPL) option came to the forefront. While affordability and ease of digital payments were benefits to consumers, the industry players were aided by steady and diversified revenue streams.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Drab ProspectsThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have declined 6.9% over the past year.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has lost 17.1% compared with the Business Services sector’s decline of 39.1%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.3% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, commonly used for valuing financial transaction services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 20.69X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.49X and the sector’s 24.43X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 26X, as low as 17.73X and at the median of 21.92X.Forward 12-Month Price/Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye onWe are presenting five stocks from the Financial Transaction Services industry that currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

125,a98f0e0e-8109-3393-af2f-5310c7dddab3,SPGI,2022-12-13,11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-sectors-invest-heading-150051104.html,1670857251,STORY,"['TMUS', 'SPGI', 'JPM', 'V', 'XOM', 'AMZN', 'ABBV', 'NVDA']","[In this article, we discuss the 11 best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. If you want to see more of the top sectors to consider, check out 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023. With a recession on the horizon, many investors are cautious when it comes to putting their money in the equity market. However, although the S&amp;P 500 is in bear territory, there are some sectors which are performing better than the others. In 2022, safe haven assets and defensive market sectors like utilities, healthcare, consumer staples, and gold have outperformed relative to the overall US market. The energy sector has also gained close to 50% year-to-date due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although defensive sectors are considered to be more lucrative investments heading into a recessionary environment, if the central bank manages to slow down interest rate hikes after achieving about 5.0% to 5.5%, then technology and high growth stocks can potentially recover. If that is the case, technology and semiconductor sectors are some of the ETFs that may outperform based on the sector rotation model.Investing in exchange traded funds allows investors affordable access to legacy large-cap firms like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). Our MethodologyWe tallied the sectors of the 100 most popular stocks among hedge funds and present the 11 most frequently invested sectors by the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022. 11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023Photo by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 202311. Telecommunications EquipmentIn 2022, the telecom industry faced new opportunities and challenges alike, driven by a dynamic regulatory, technological, and competitive backdrop. The $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized in November allots $65 billion for ongoing broadband adoption and deployment. The global telecom equipment market was worth $538.9 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to reach $967.9 billion by 2030, indicating a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period of 2022 to 2030. Story continuesOne of the best telecommunications equipment stocks to invest in according to elite hedge funds is T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), a Washington-based company that provides mobile communications services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company also offers wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, and other mobile communication devices. For full-year 2022, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)’s postpaid net customer additions are expected to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, an increase from the prior guidance of 6.0 million to 6.3 million.Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on November 15 raised the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $202 from $195 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares. The company's growing ability to leverage its ""massive ""5G high-speed network will continue to drive increasing customer gains and revenue growth”, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst said T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)’s leadership position in 5G continues to support ""industry-leading postpaid service revenue and cash flow growth.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 100 hedge funds were long T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with a stake worth $703.3 million. Like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the stocks favored by elite hedge funds. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”10. Internet and Information ServicesInternet and Information Services is one of the best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. The global IT services market grew from $3,471.35 billion in 2021 to $3,938.75 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. The market is forecasted to reach $5,905.09 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 10.7%. Financial services, retail and wholesale, manufacturing, and healthcare are some end-user markets for the Internet and Information Services industry.One of the best information services stocks to invest in according to smart investors includes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. It operates in six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. Year-to-date as of October 27, the company has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program and expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the ASR in December 2022. On December 2, BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber raised the price target on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) to $400 from $393 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst lifted his FY23 EPS view to $12.00 to $11.66 after its Investor Day presentation and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)’s numerous growth drivers, including higher use of technology, demand for risk solutions, and sustainability.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was part of 90 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 84 in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 8.7 million shares worth $2.6 billion. Baron Funds made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”9. Catalog/Specialty Distribution Catalog/Specialty Distribution is one of the top sectors to look out for in 2023. One of the premier stocks in the industry is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a technology conglomerate that engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. The company operates through three segments – North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. On November 30, Amazon Web Services announced that it will likely keep hiring in 2023 and construct new data centers despite a hiring freeze at the rest of the company.On December 1, Cowen analyst John Blackledge raised the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $160 from $150 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he expects lower operating losses excluding AWS and Advertising in 2023 as cost headwinds normalize.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 269 funds reported owning stakes worth $34.6 billion in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 252 funds in the prior quarter worth $30 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest stake in the company, with approximately 50 million shares worth $5.6 billion. L1 Capital International made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Quarterly results (mostly reported in late July and early August) were generally in line with our expectations. Solid company execution was subsequently swamped by increases in interest rates and hawkish Federal Reserve commentary. During the quarter, only one company (Amazon.com) made a positive contribution of more than 0.5% in Australian dollars. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the largest negative contributor in the June 2022 quarter, with the share price recovering modestly but it is still well below our view of fair value. No company detracted more than 0.5% from the Fund’s performance in Australian dollars, although the depreciation of the Australian dollar obfuscates some meaningful share price falls in U.S. dollarsWe did not participate in the ‘unprofitable tech bubble’, but our portfolio does have significant exposure to some of the largest, highly profitable and incredibly financially strong technology companies which dominate their markets and have outstanding medium to long term growth prospects – including Alphabet, Amazon, Intuit and Microsoft. The share price of these companies has now fallen to levels we now consider to provide very attractive valuations for long term investors.”8. Oil &amp; Gas Production The Oil &amp; Gas Production industry reported all-time high profits in 2022, offering sufficient cash flow to finance their operations in 2023. While oil and gas companies understand the geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop they will be faced with in the year ahead, they understand that the transition to cleaner energy in the long term is inevitable. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise in 2023 but at a slower pace than 2022. OPEC forecasts demand to increase by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or 2.7%, in 2023.According to smart investors, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading oil and gas stocks to consider for a balanced portfolio. Q3 2022 was the most lucrative quarter for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as net income came in at $19.66 billion, revenues surged 52% year-over-year to $112.07 billion, and the company raised its quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $0.91 per share.On November 22, Citi analyst Alastair Syme raised the price target on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $110 from $98 and reaffirmed a Neutral rating on the shares. The market rotation into energy equities has ""further to run, even though names in our US coverage already sit at all-time highs,"" the analyst told investors. History suggests that energy firms usually perform well in an earnings recession, which is Citi's base-case for 2023, wrote the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 72 funds in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 33.8 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7. Major BanksAs the global economy remains fragile heading into 2023, with high risk of stagflation or a mild recession, the effects will be felt across the banking industry as well. However, large, well-capitalized, and diversified banks should survive the market volatility relatively well. One of such banks is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), which operates worldwide through Consumer &amp; Community Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset &amp; Wealth Management segments. On November 30, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it is seeking to expand its retirement products in China, the world's second largest economy, as China officially launched its private pension system last week. Citi analyst Keith Horowitz on October 17 reiterated a Buy rating on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a $135 price target following the company's Q3 results. The analyst said the bank is ""hitting on all cylinders"" and that present share levels offer an ""excellent entry point"" for a ""quality franchise.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 104 in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent stake in the company, comprising 7.5 million shares worth $788 million. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”6. Business ServicesThe global business support services market grew from $561.32 billion in 2021 to $621.03 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 10.6%. The business support services market is expected to reach $835.66 billion in 2026, indicating a CAGR of 7.7%. Business-to-business, social, and business-to-consumer are the three main categories of business services. It is one of the best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), an American financial technology company offering transaction processing, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, is one of the best business services stocks to monitor. On November 25, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported that its U.S. payments volume in November increased 9% from a year ago, even after the company suspended its operations in Russia in March 2022, and the volume was up 10% in October 2022. On December 2, Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti raised the price target on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to $250 from $225 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is becoming even more involved in the global money movement ecosystem with its new products, making it harder to disintermediate them in any significant way, the analyst told investors. He thinks Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) can still deliver 20% EPS growth for the foreseeable future.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 165 hedge funds were bullish on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 166 funds in the last quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1 billion.In addition to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), smart investors are piling into Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) heading into 2023. Baron Funds made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global payment network Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) fell despite reporting financial results that beat Street forecasts and sustained volume growth in recent months. Revenue grew 19% and EPS grew 33% in the most recent quarter, and double-digit payment volume growth persisted through August. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and may be due to foreign exchange headwinds and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending. We continue to own the stock due to Visa’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:Most Advanced Countries in Artificial Intelligence10 Youngest Hedge Fund Billionaires10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

With another year of vaccinations and growing frustrations with lockdowns domestically in China, restrictions will likely ease somewhat in 2023 and imports of fossil fuels can be expected to increase again.""The S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights Energy Outlook 2023 presumes China's total energy demand will increase by 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from virtually no growth in 2022. This will represent 47% of global energy demand growth next year. While China's imports will likely return to growth a growth pathway, India has been a strong demand performer over the past year, with imports of oil and coal notably higher year-on-year, as it has absorbed significant volumes or Russian supply that would have gone to Europe.OVERVIEWThe incredible rollercoaster ride that energy markets have been on since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019/2020 has been extended, with unprecedented uncertainty on global energy supply developing over the past year in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, amid a backdrop of a weaker macro economy and high inflation. In 2023, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expects that markets will be on an extended pathway of recalibration as supply and demand fundamentals adjust to elevated prices and supply uncertainty. Barring a significantly deeper recession than expected, it will take several years of stronger supply growth than demand growth for inventory cushions to return to comfortable levels, particularly if Russian energy export reductions are more severe than anticipated. For oil, while global supply will increase, it will grow slower in 2023 at around 1.7 million barrels per day (b/d) than the 4.5 million b/d growth in 2022, due to greater losses from Russia and limited upside from OPEC. While there has been a growing narrative that the US shale revolution is over, we expect 0.7 million b/d of oil supply growth from US shale alone, with additional growth in crude production coming from Norway, Brazil, Canada, and Guyana.Story continuesFor natural gas, global supply growth, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG), will be limited in 2023 despite extremely high prices, due to a lack of new liquefaction facilities coming online. This will require LNG markets to balance again on demand destruction rather than supply growth. This dynamic will be particularly apparent in Europe, where there will be even less Russian gas supply in 2023 than in 2022, requiring considerable demand destruction.In general, commodity prices are expected to ease over 2023, as fundamentals pull toward recalibration. Natural gas, coal, and crude oil prices are all expected to be lower in 2023 than 2022 on average. However, while the ""platinum age"" of refining will ultimately come to an end, 2023 should still be golden for refiners, with refined products prices maintaining lofty levels. Electricity prices are also poised to deflate, with another tranche of renewables becoming operational and European policymakers looking to weaken the link between natural gas and power prices. Once again, demand for all fossil fuels will increase in 2023, which points to a global CO2 emissions rise despite continued attention paid to climate and the energy transition. The environment created by prevailing geopolitical uncertainty, weaker macroeconomic growth, and high inflation will keep the energy security versus energy transition debate front and center. While there have been commodity crises driven by supply disruptions in the past, the world is dealing with the first truly global energy crisis across all fuels. The market will adjust with fuel substitution and altered trade flows, requiring a holistic global perspective across the breadth of the energy market.China's COVID policy is the most important fundamental factor for energy marketsTOP TEN KEY THEMES TO THE 2023 ENERGY OUTLOOK: S&amp;P GLOBAL COMMODITY INSIGHTS:  China's COVID policy is the most important fundamental factor for energy markets. China's COVID-related restrictions which led to underperforming energy demand growth, and weaker Chinese energy imports was a key safety valve for oil, gas, and coal markets in 2022. Were it not for this demand weakness, prices of all commodities would have undoubtedly been higher, as energy supply not absorbed by China shifted to other areas, highlighted by LNG supply shifting to Europe. While China's imports of crude oil (-0.2 million b/d, -2.0%), LNG (-58 million cubic meters (cu m) -19.7%), and thermal coal (-45 million metric tons (mt), -17.2%) are all on track to contract in 2022, we expect them all to return to growth in 2023. Rising unrest and public protests over COVID policies support this view. If China's energy demand and imports are strong in 2023, commodity prices will be well supported, but another year of subdued demand from China would be a significantly bearish development for virtually all commodity prices.India will have its say as well. With China somewhat on the sidelines in 2022, India's energy demand proved to be one of the greatest areas of strength. While India's LNG imports will decline year-on-year over 2022, its oil demand will increase by just shy of 0.3 million barrels per day (b/d), with only the United States growing by a larger amount. India's imports of thermal coal increased by most of any country in the world in 2022 by far (+15 million mt). India has proved to be a key source of demand for Russian energy that would have ordinarily gone to Europe in 2022, and this dynamic becomes even more important as European sanctions on oil tighten, although there are significant questions if India will be willing or able to absorb even more Russian supply. The recalibration of energy markets will outlast 2023. Global energy markets have been battered with a pandemic, an uneven recovery, swings in OPEC policy and record uncertainty around energy supply in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Even before 2022 began, global inventories were strained due to a stronger recovery in demand than supply from COVID, with several markets requiring demand destruction to balance. Even if commodity supply/demand balances loosen more than expected in the coming year, almost all markets will require another year or more of recalibration before inventories, balances, and prices return to a more sustainable equilibrium. Even in agricultural commodities, where new planting seasons usually offer new beginnings, several planting seasons will be required to recover from the Ukraine/Russia losses.The reports of US shale's demise are greatly exaggerated. There is a growing narrative in the market that ""the shale revolution is dead"". While growth in shale has and will continue to be more controlled than in recent years, US shale production, including natural gas liquids (NGLs), is on track to increase by more than 1.0 million b/d in 2022 and another 1.4 million b/d in 2023, representing one of the largest components of global supply growth in both years. Shale oil price breakevens (less than $50 per barrel) remain on the low end of the global supply curve, and ~90% of the 180 billion barrels of technically-recoverable oil is yet to be developed. After a sluggish start to the year, US natural gas production has increased by 3 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2022, and another 3 Bcf/d of growth is expected in 2023.The ""Platinum Age"" of refining will ultimately come to an end, but 2023 should still be golden for refiners. Refining margins in 2022 were the strongest ever on a sustained basis, driven particularly by middle distillate strength. This requires a new moniker for describing this period, and we have dubbed it the ""platinum age"". While some refining cracks will weaken over 2023 due to slower demand growth and new refinery startups, diesel cracks are expected to stay much stronger than historical averages in 2023. And gasoline cracks are expected to strengthen sharply for the second quarter. Furthermore, there is also upside to margins due to low middle distillate inventories and the potential for larger reductions of Russian diesel exports than currently assumed. Overall, refining margins are expected to remain strong for 2023. The capacity driven, cyclical petrochemicals downturn will last at least through 2023, depending on the pace of capacity rationalization. There will be nowhere to hide in the global petrochemicals market during 2023, noted Robert Stier, Sr Lead, Global Petrochemicals, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights; All value chains (olefins, aromatics, and polymers) will continue to be under severe margin pressure.European gas and power markets may be even tighter in 2023. European consumers and policymakers achieved a herculean feat in 2022 by building up natural gas storage to near capacity ahead of winter, with an armada of LNG vessels still waiting to unload supply via the Continent's expanded regasification capacity. Despite this exemplary performance, the encore in 2023 may be more challenging as Europe will have to deal with a full year's worth of virtually no Russian gas, and only a small increase in global LNG supply. European gas will need to balance on demand destruction rather than growth in available supply. Additionally, European buyers should not count on a recurrence of weak Asian LNG and mild temperatures in late-autumn/early-winter to facilitate storage builds. With natural gas prices expected to remain elevated, structural reform of Europe's electricity markets to weaken the link between gas and power prices is high on the agenda for 2023, although there will be significant challenges to achieving such measures.Energy security/affordability and energy transition decisions to become even more difficult and complex. 2022 was marked by difficult choices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some nations loosened restrictions on the operation of coal-fired power plants, while others extended the lives of coal and nuclear power plants that were planned to retire. However, demand destruction from high prices across a variety of sectors and continued renewables generation growth limited emissions. With several economies expected to be in a recession in 2023 and fiscal budgets stretched, policymakers will be looking to keep energy prices low, perhaps sacrificing progress on the energy transition. While high fossil fuel prices may accelerate some consumers' plans to switch to an electric vehicle or install rooftop solar, the drain of household wealth from high inflation will limit consumers' ability to lay out the higher upfront capital for these green technologies even if they are less expensive that fossil fuels over the lifetime of the asset. The importance of international climate agreements and the annual COPs for driving energy transition will be tested. Amidst concerns around energy security, economic growth, and geopolitical tensions, COP27 in Egypt featured a general lack of increased ambition on reducing emissions. While COP27 did lead to a global agreement featuring historic language on loss and damage, establishing a fund for the costs of climate change for the most vulnerable emerging and developing economies, relatively little was agreed to address the emissions driving climate change. To be sure, progress on the energy transition has been made over the past year through domestic industrial policies, bilateral agreements, and ties among smaller groups of stakeholders – efforts such as the Five-Year Plan in China, Fit for 55 in the EU, the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., and Just Energy Transition Partnerships. More targeted forums such as the G20 – led by India in this coming year - are increasingly providing platforms for impactful decisions.The drivers of energy supply shift more toward policy over economics, increasing volatility. The importance of policy on energy supply was on full display in 2022, headlined by the policy responses to the Russian invasion, the swinging probabilities of an Iran nuclear deal, recent loosening of some sanctions on Venezuela, and OPEC's production quota policies. A clear example of how important supply policy will be in 2023 is how effective the price cap on Russian supply will be. While forecasting markets based on the economics of supply and demand can be difficult, predicting what policymakers will do is next to impossible. Even energy producers situated in countries with limited or more predictable governmental policies will be affected by policies, such ESG pressures from shareholders, net zero commitments, and carbon border adjustment mechanisms. Inefficiencies in global trade will continue to support freight rates and delivered prices. The emergence of new trading patterns in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to greater inefficiencies in the shipping sector. Specifically, Europe's source diversification for oil, and the need to send Russian oil to Asia has led to increased ton-mile demand and consequently clean and dirty tanker freight rates. Additionally, the efforts to supply Europe with enough gas for the winter created a notable increase in the use of floating storage of LNG tankers. These conditions are expected to persist and perhaps intensify in 2023, which should keep freight rates elevated, and keep delivered prices supported.EUROPE AND NATURAL GAS""European suppliers achieved a herculean feat in 2022 by building up natural gas storage to near capacity ahead of winter,"" said Michael Stoppard, Global Gas Strategy Lead and Special Advisor, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""Round Two' in 2023 may be more challenging as Europe will have to deal for the first time with a full year's worth of minimal Russian pipeline gas,  and only a small increase in global LNG supply. European gas will need to balance on reduced demand rather than growth in available supply. Additionally, in a global gas system without any slack, European buyers cannot count on a recurrence of weak Asian LNG and mild temperatures.""Media ContactsGlobal/EMEA: Paul Sandell, + 44 (0)7816 180039, paul.sandell@spglobal.comAmericas: Kathleen Tanzy, +1 917-331-4607, kathleen.tanzy@spglobal.comAsia/EMEA: Melissa Tan, +65-6597-6241, melissa.tan@spglobal.comAbout S&amp;P Global Commodity InsightsAt S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, our complete view of global energy and commodities markets enables our customers to make decisions with conviction and create long-term, sustainable value.We're a trusted connector that brings together thought leaders, market participants, governments, and regulators and we create solutions that lead to progress.

V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. FLT.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027768/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-despite-industry-woesThe Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to benefit from the growing adoption of digital means – a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Though improved consumer spending and rebounding travel remain underway, the optimistic scenario might be strained by the continued impact of inflation.Elevated technology investments in order to sustain one’s market position remain a significant challenge for financial transaction services providers. Despite such headwinds, companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. are placed well to counter the industry headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Influencing the Financial Transaction Services Industry's FutureSevere Competition Compelling Heavy Technology Investments: The Financial Transaction Services space witnesses intensifying competition as a result of which industry players are compelled to undertake significant technology investments. The ongoing trend to go digital has triggered the need to opt for investments in order to upgrade one’s digital capabilities. But rolling out advanced digital payment solutions is not adequate, as increased digitization often gives rise to sophisticated forms of cybercrimes.Story continuesTherefore, the industry players also need to undertake investments for equipping themselves with enhanced fraud detection solutions. An elevated expense level might hamper margins of the industry players.M&amp;A Strategy Under Pressure: Players of the Financial Transaction Services space frequently resort to a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy for bolstering capabilities, bringing diversification benefits, expanding global presence and increasing the customer base. However, per S&amp;P Global, M&amp;A activity has been on a downtrend this year and shows no signs of a sharp turnaround in the near term.The Fed’s frequent rate hikes in order to counter inflationary headwinds stir volatility in equity markets. As a result, the purchasing power of consumers suffered a blow. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of financing, which makes businesses reluctant to pursue M&amp;A deals.Better Consumer Spending &amp; Rebounding Travel: Consumer spending seems not to have been much affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ first estimate of third-quarter 2022 Gross Domestic Product. This brings a ray of hope for financial transaction services stocks since the transaction volumes of these players depend, to a large extent, on consumer spending.Even amid the ongoing pressure of inflation, substantial personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a cushion, facilitating continued consumer spending. With border restrictions lifted and the pandemic becoming the new normal of life, individuals have resumed traveling. However, the future of consumer spending looks uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature of inflation and looming recession fears.Growing Adoption of Contactless Payment Methods: The pandemic-induced shift toward contactless payments proved to be a boon for not only consumers but for financial transaction services players as well. With cash and checks taking a backseat, several flexible digital payment options such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, QR code and buy now, pay later (BNPL) option came to the forefront. While affordability and ease of digital payments were benefits to consumers, the industry players were aided by steady and diversified revenue streams.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Drab ProspectsThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have declined 6.9% over the past year.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has lost 17.1% compared with the Business Services sector’s decline of 39.1%. The S&amp;P 500 has declined 17.3% in the same time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, commonly used for valuing financial transaction services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 20.69X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.49X and the sector’s 24.43X.Over the last five years, the industry traded as high as 26X, as low as 17.73X and at the median of 21.92X.5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting five stocks from the Financial Transaction Services industry that currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

While the consumer price index (CPI), which is due at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT), is expected to show that inflation eased further in November, markets are wary of any unexpected strength in the reading.The U.S. producer price index, which gauges manufacturing inflation, eased less than expected in November, raising fears of a similar trend in the CPI.Spot gold was flat at $1,782.17 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,793.10 an ounce. Both instruments sank over 1% on Monday.A stronger-than-expected inflation reading is likely to elicit a hawkish response from the Federal Reserve - a move that could push up the dollar and Treasury yields while heralding more pressure on metal markets. The greenback steadied above a five-month low on Tuesday.While the central bank is set to hike interest rates by 50 basis points at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, its guidance on where interest rates will peak will be closely watched. The Fed hiked rates by a total 375 bps this year, which weighed heavily on gold by driving up the opportunity cost of holding the yellow metal.While the central bank signaled it will raise interest rates at a slower pace in the coming months, it also warned that interest rates could peak at much higher levels if inflation shows little signs of easing.Other precious metals were mildly positive on Tuesday after logging sharp losses in the prior sessions. Platinum futures rose 0.1%, while silver futures added 0.5%.Among industrial metals, copper prices edged higher after falling sharply in the prior session.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $3.8137 a pound, recovering from a 1% drop.The red metal is expected to see volatile trade in the coming weeks amid uncertainty over how major importer China will carry out an economic reopening from nearly three years of COVID lockdowns.While the country relaxed several movement and quarantine measures, it is still coping with its worst ever outbreak.Related ArticlesGold nurses sharp losses as U.S. CPI report, Fed meeting loomAs Russia pounds Ukraine civil infrastructure, powers meet to provide aidU.S. sends first shipment of power gear to aid Ukraine]"

134,61bf5007-f573-3a8a-8541-bd0d44ca2193,MA,2022-12-13,5 Financial Transaction Stocks in Focus Despite Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-financial-transaction-stocks-focus-154803479.html,1670860083,STORY,"['GPN', 'SPGI', 'V', 'MA', 'FLT', 'FISV']","[The Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to benefit from the growing adoption of digital means – a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Though improved consumer spending and rebounding travel remain underway, the optimistic scenario might be strained by the continued impact of inflation. Elevated technology investments in order to sustain one’s market position remain a significant challenge for financial transaction services providers. Despite such headwinds, companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. FLT are placed well to counter the industry headwinds.About the Industry The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Influencing the Financial Transaction Services Industry's FutureSevere Competition Compelling Heavy Technology Investments: The Financial Transaction Services space witnesses intensifying competition as a result of which industry players are compelled to undertake significant technology investments. The ongoing trend to go digital has triggered the need to opt for investments in order to upgrade one’s digital capabilities. But rolling out advanced digital payment solutions is not adequate, as increased digitization often gives rise to sophisticated forms of cybercrimes. Therefore, the industry players also need to undertake investments for equipping themselves with enhanced fraud detection solutions. An elevated expense level might hamper margins of the industry players.Story continuesM&amp;A Strategy Under Pressure: Players of the Financial Transaction Services space frequently resort to a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy for bolstering capabilities, bringing diversification benefits, expanding global presence and increasing the customer base. However, per S&amp;P Global, M&amp;A activity has been on a downtrend this year and shows no signs of a sharp turnaround in the near term. The Fed’s frequent rate hikes in order to counter inflationary headwinds stir volatility in equity markets. As a result, the purchasing power of consumers suffered a blow. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of financing, which makes businesses reluctant to pursue M&amp;A deals.Better Consumer Spending &amp; Rebounding Travel: Consumer spending seems not to have been much affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ first estimate of third-quarter 2022 Gross Domestic Product. This brings a ray of hope for financial transaction services stocks since the transaction volumes of these players depend, to a large extent, on consumer spending. Even, amid the ongoing pressure of inflation, substantial personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a cushion, facilitating continued consumer spending. With border restrictions lifted and the pandemic becoming the new normal of life, individuals have resumed traveling. However, the future of consumer spending looks uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature of inflation and looming recession fears.Growing Adoption of Contactless Payment Methods: The pandemic-induced shift toward contactless payments proved to be a boon for not only consumers but for financial transaction services players as well. With cash and checks taking a backseat, several flexible digital payment options such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, QR code and buy now, pay later (BNPL) option came to the forefront. While affordability and ease of digital payments were benefits to consumers, the industry players were aided by steady and diversified revenue streams.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Drab ProspectsThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

The industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 have declined 6.9% over the past year.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector and S&amp;P 500The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has outperformed its sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has lost 17.1% compared with the Business Services sector’s decline of 39.1%.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.43%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.58%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.01%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 1.96% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 8.36%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.12%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Qualcomm as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Qualcomm to post earnings of $2.36 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 26.93%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $9.62 billion, down 10.15% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $10.21 per share and revenue of $40.13 billion. These totals would mark changes of -18.52% and -9.21%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Qualcomm. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Qualcomm is holding a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Looking at its valuation, Qualcomm is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 11.66. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 17.76, so we one might conclude that Qualcomm is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 0.75 right now.

Qualcomm shares are falling this morning. Wells Fargo cut the stock to underweight from equal weight. Did keep the price target at $105.But this is the only sell equivalent rating on Qualcomm on Wall Street, which is interesting. And it's sort of in line with the firm's view overall on some of these mobile phone chip makers. They had downgraded Skyworks and Qorvo previously. Now, the downgrade piper, if you will, come in for Qualcomm with this.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, Qualcomm had a-- I mean that was a challenging third quarter they put up that really shocked the market. But look at the different tone between this downgrade to sell on Qualcomm and then what we saw from Broadcom last week, really a blowout quarter. The Street couldn't get enough of Broadcom.BRAD SMITH: Well, this is another cycle story, too, because the smartphone outlook has been rattled by the number of consumers who are looking at prices and saying, you know what? As long as my phone is still working at this point and I'm in the process of perhaps cutting costs where possible on the discretionary spending side, then I'm not necessarily looking at a new phone device that I need to buy right now or that's even partially subsidized through a phone carrier.And so within that supercycle being pushed out even further within the smartphone category, that could have a longer term impact on all of the chip manufacturers. And as Apple is going further into investing in building out its own chips now, too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I mean, all of these chip makers have been hit by all of these this perception, right? So at some times it is beneficial to Qualcomm to be concentrating on mobile and sometimes it's not.[WALL STREET BELL RINGING]]"

However, with the U.S. services sector, the job market, and consumer spending holding up quite well, it’s  difficult for me to imagine how the profit collapse predicted by Wilson could materialize. Actually, it’s hard to believe that the earnings of many companies won’t be stronger than expected. Especially if oil prices stay at their current, low levels and overall inflation continues to retreat. Given these points, I think that investors should use the latest decline as an opportunity to buy a number of the best Nasdaq stock picks for 2023 that I will list below.In addition, I’d take Wilson’s warning with a grain of salt. In June, Wilson suggested that U.S. earnings would plunge. Also worth noting is that, in late June 2022, Wilson suggested that U.S. earnings would plunge, noting, “We see a pretty poor risk reward over the next 3-6 months with recession risk rising in the face of very stubborn inflation readings.” However, U.S. earnings haven’t plunged, and nearly six months later, the S&amp;P 500 has risen 6% above its late June levels, even after yesterday’s slump that was partially induced by Wilson himself. (As of the morning of Dec. 1, the index had jumped nearly 9% above its late June levels). So contrary to popular belief, Wilson’s predictions have been far from perfect this year.Again, I’d use the latest pullback as an opportunity to pick up some of the best NASDAQ stock picks for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTSLATesla$176.68PLUGPlug Power$13.86ICADiCAD$1.71SHLSShoals Technologies$24.47EXPEExpedia$96.24UALUnited Airlines$45.42WDAYWorkday$160.88Tesla (TSLA)Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, ItalySource: Zigres / Shutterstock.comTesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares slumped on reports the company would reduce production of its Model Y EV by 20% at its Shanghai plant from Nov.Story continuesHowever, Tesla forcefully denied the report. Even if the news is true, it doesn’t mean that the company’s overall sales growth is slowing. As Barron’s pointed out, Tesla could have decided to reduce production of its Model Y and increase production of one of its other EVs instead. Also possible is that Tesla decided to cut production in China and raise production at another one of its factories simultaneously. In my view, other news involving Tesla and TSLA stock is much more critical. Specifically, the forward price-earnings ratio of TSLA stock, which dropped to just 35.8. That’s very low for a company which is the runaway leader of a booming market.Finally, Tesla recently made the first deliveries of its full-size truck, the Tesla Semi. Since the EV, according to TSLA, “has triple the power [of] any diesel truck on the road right now.” and can haul a full load 500 miles one one charge, I believe that it will become a major revenue generator for the automaker.Plug Power (PLUG)Nasdaq in focus accompanied by a green arrow and the word ""NYSE""Source: ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) continues to make meaningful progress as it seeks to solidify its position as a leader in the green hydrogen revolution. As PLUG opens more of its green hydrogen factories, its margins are poised to meaningfully rise. That’s because the company can produce green hydrogen at its own plants at less cost. Also, the large tax credit for green hydrogen should also be a game changer for PLUG next year. As a result of these upcoming, positive catalysts, the company predicts that its 2023 revenue will come in at $1.4 billion.PLUG also expected to generate “breakeven operating margins” by the end of  next year.On other fronts, Plug Power’s joint venture with Renault, the giant European automaker, is expected to ramp up next year, as the venture is poised to produce and deliver 800 vans in 2023. Also noteworthy is that Plug Power’s partner, Airbus (OTC:EADSY), the huge European plane manufacturer, recently announced “that it is developing a hydrogen-powered fuel cell engine.” The company intends to begin conducting trials of the engine around 2025 , and the company plans to start building new aircraft that may utilize hydrogen in five to six years.Consequently, within a year or two, it could become apparent that Airbus is going to buy a large amount of hydrogen from Plug Power. As a result, PLUG stock could very well get a huge boost between the end of 2023, sometime in 2024, or even sooner. As Plug’s potential comes into clearer view next year, PLUG stock should rise dramatically, making the shares one of the best Nasdaq stock picks for 2023.iCAD (ICAD)Bright signs for Nasdaq (NDAQ) cover the Nasdaq building in Times Square.Source: ShutterstockA developer of artificial intelligence-driven products used to detect cancer, iCAD (NASDAQ:ICAD) recently announced  that it had reached a deal with Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Health. Under the agreement, Google Health’s AI will be incorporated “into iCAD’s portfolio of breast imaging AI solutions.”The deal will constitute the introduction of Google’s breast imaging AI into clinical practice. Moreover, Google agreed to license its AI tevchnology to iCAD. Over the longer term, the deal should be a game changer for iCAD and ICAD stock. First, in the eyes of investors and potential customers, Alphabet’s decision to partner with iCAD should validate iCAD’s technology. Secondly, since Google Health is licensing its technology to iCAD, Alphabet should benefit financially from the proliferation of iCAD’s “breast AI technologies.” As a result, Alphabet is likely to use its huge sales force, gigantic network of contacts, and large amounts of money to boost the sales of iCAD’s tevhnologies.Trading with a bargain-basement market capitalization of just $43.57 million and just 1.5x sales, iCAD stock does not appear to reflect any of these opportunities.Shoals Technologies (SHLS)conceptual image of the word NASDAQ surrounded buy red stock chart actionSource: ShutterstockA developer of components used in solar-energy projects, Shoals (NASDAQ:SHLS) should get a big lift from two recent decisions made by the Biden Administration. Specifically, the administration found that four Chinese solar panel makers did not seek to avoid tariffs by opening factories in nearby Asian countries. Also, in-line with my previous predictions, US Customs and Border Protection released a major proportion of the solar panels hat it had been impounding in response to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The panels were made by China’s JinkoSolar (NYSE:JKS).Since the U.S. has been suffering from a shortage of solar panels, the moves by the administration should enable more large-scale solar projects to get underway in the country more quickly, reducing Shoals’ “backlog and awarded orders of $471.2 million” and boosting the company’s top and bottom lines. It’s probably not a coincidence that, since both of the Biden administration’s moves were reported on Dec. 2, SHLS stock has climbed nearly 10%. Finally, as I pointed out in a previous column, last quarter, Shoals’ “Revenue was up 52% year over year to $91 million,” and its “Gross margin expanded to 39.7%, up 330 basis points from a year ago, while adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share easily exceeded the 2 cents analysts were calling for.”Expedia (EXPE)Expedia app logo on a smartphone screenSource: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.comExpedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) reported very impressive third-quarter results. From here, the company should continue to benefit from the very strong, pent-up demand for travel well into 2023. Moreover, the valuation of EXPE stock remains very attractive. In Q3, Expedia’s top line climbed 22% year-over-year to a record $3.62 billion, while its operating income, excluding certain items, surged 42% YOY to $747 million. Also, in the first nine months of 2022, Expedia’s free cash flow soared over 100% to $3.1 billion. And the company’s Q3 lodging bookings also set an all-time record last quarter.Moreover, EXPE CEO Peter Kern reported that the company would resume buying back its stock which the company views as “highly undervalued.” In addition, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) said EXPE’s Q3 results had been “solid,” adding that it is pleased with the company’s loyalty and investment efforts. the firm maintained an “overweight” rating on EXPE.United Airlines (UAL)a jet takes off on a clear runway.Source: m.photo / Shutterstock.comUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was named a top airline pick by Morgan Stanley, which tends to be one of the more bearish firms on the Street. Among the positive catalysts cited by Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker were a rebound in international travel and the new contract that United signed with its pilots. Shanker added that the airline’s, “Earnings recovery out of the pandemic has kept pace with, if not led, peers,” while widespread concerns about the company’s profitability have been laid to rest. “UAL seems on track to exceed its 2023 guidance and to hit its 2026 guide issued 18 months ago — something even the biggest UAL bulls may have considered difficult at the time.” In addition, analysts at Cowen also said the UAL stock is its top pick among airline stocks, citing the company’s high exposure to international flights.Workday (WDAY)software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecuritySource: ShutterstockWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) provides software that helps companies manage their human resources and financial applications.The company reported very strong third-quarter results on Nov. 29. Its revenue jumped 20% year-over-year to $1.6 billion and came in slightly above analysts’ average estimate. More impressively, its operating cash flow increased to $409 million, up from $385 million during the same period a year earlier, while it generated earnings per share of 99 cents, well ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 84 cents. “We are well-positioned in this type of [macro] environment because our cloud finance and HR solutions are truly mission-critical. As our Q3 results showed, more and more organizations are selecting Workday as their trusted partner to help them successfully navigate today’s changing world,” Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri said during the company’s Q3 earnings call.Further, the company announced a new, $500 million share buyback plan.  In a note to investors, investment firm Monness, Crespi, Hardt wrote that the company has “a large market opportunity” and is carrying out its initiatives well. However, the firm kept a “neutral” rating on the shares, citing macro issues. But, as I indicated in my introduction, I believe that worries about the macro issues are overdone.On the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of SHLS,JKS,ICAD and PLUG.

The award has been offered by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C.Details of the DealValued at $328.5 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Sep 30, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will provide Strategic Weapon System Trident Fleet support, Trident II Shipboard Integration Increment 8 and navigation subsystem development efforts.The contract will serve the United States and United Kingdom. The majority of work related to this deal will be executed in Mitchel Field, NY.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin is a prime defense contractor for defense arsenals and ammunition. It enjoys a lucrative position in manufacturing military missiles. In this context, its Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of the U.S. Navy's submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, following the highly successful Polaris, Poseidon and Trident I C4 programs.Trident II (D5) is a three-stage, solid-propellant, inertial-guided ballistic missile developed by Lockheed Martin. The missile can carry multiple independently targeted reentry bodies for a maximum range of more than 7,360 km. The missile cannot be tracked when it is being operated as it has a sea-based deterrent.Such remarkable features must have boosted its demand in the military landscape. Its strong demand can be gauged from 14 U.S. Navy Ohio-class submarines with American warheads and four Royal Navy Vanguard-class submarines with British warheads equipped with this missile. The latest contract win is a bright example of the solid demand that the Trident missile enjoys in the defense market.Per a report from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 4.9% during the 2022-2027 period. Such an expanding market size is likely to benefit LMT as it enjoys a solid position in the military missile market.Story continuesPeer GrowthProminent defense majors that have been manufacturing missiles for the defense industry and are likely to enjoy the perks of increased demand are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.3%.

The Forum's agenda, which was designed with the support of the Global TB Caucus, was focused on understanding the impact of TB on youth and children and developing and sharing innovative approaches about opportunities to enable, accelerate and mobilize youth as agents of change in TB elimination.Johnson &amp; Johnson logo (PRNewsfoto/Johnson &amp; Johnson)Young people between the age of 15 and 34 are disproportionately affected and carry among the heaviest burden of the disease. They are also often the largest population group in developing countries with the role and potential to contribute immensely to a nation's social and economic capital. Enabling their access to care and ensuring their meaningful participation in the effort to end TB at all levels will pave the way to a better, safer and healthier world free of TB.[1]""Despite the high risks of infection, young people are less likely to seek TB treatment for various reasons, including a lack of awareness about disease symptoms or stigma associated with the disease. Thus, it is critical that we collaborate with partners around the world to galvanise youth to help raise community awareness, promote health-seeking behaviour, drive an increase in early diagnosis of TB and ultimately, ensure those affected receive the care they need,"" said OakYeon Kim, Vice President, Government Affairs &amp; Policy, Janssen Asia Pacific.Story continuesFor more than two decades, Johnson &amp; Johnson has been a committed global partner in the fight against TB. As part of its 10-year TB initiative which kicked off in 2018, Johnson &amp; Johnson is focused on engaging and empowering young people – an alarmingly vulnerable population who are both highly affected and highly connected – in the fight against TB, including through the TB Changemakers in India and TB Warriors campaign which aims to encourage youth in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to be healthy and advocate for their community by sharing TB resources through social media and mobile games to help empower a generation of youth to end TB.The annual Forum's goal is to provide a platform where key stakeholders who can play a role in TB elimination come together to share, collaborate, ideate and amplify initiatives, to close gaps and to fuel the momentum for patient ﬁnding, with a focus on youth as a target, youth as parents (to ﬁnd children with TB) and youth as catalysts. Public-private partnerships and multiple collaborations have also been essential to fight TB across the region.The focus on youth was also ignited by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 with their first-ever Youth Town Hall to End TB in Jakarta, Indonesia. Their participation in the forum highlighted that young people are changemakers, are important partners to the National TB Programs, and they need to be engaged in every step of the way towards ending TB.""It is distressing to know that tuberculosis is resurgent across India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, and in particular, impacting the youth demographic. AVPN, as the world's largest community of social investors in Asia, is proud to partner with Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Global Fund and the Global TB Caucus in engaging the social investor audience to mobilize much needed capital towards this issue,"" said Naina Subberwal Batra, CEO of AVPN.A key topic area in both days of the Forum was on the importance of TB elimination since TB is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in the region. In Asia Pacific, TB response has been hard hit by COVID-19, while 12 of the 30 countries with the highest burden of drug-resistant TB are in this region. In 2021, five countries accounted for 90 percent of the global reduction in case notifications of people diagnosed with TB compared to 2019 – all of them in Asia Pacific – India, China, Indonesia, Philippines and Myanmar.[2]""As the largest international funder for TB programs, the Global Fund is a critical partner in helping to achieve the goal of ending TB by 2030. In the Asia-Pacific region and everywhere, we must scale up efforts with public and private partners, civil society and communities affected by TB to find and treat all people with TB, mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on TB programs, address the socioeconomic barriers to care and strengthen resilient, sustainable and inclusive health and community systems that can respond to current and future disease threats. At all levels of our action, we need to better include young people, in all their diversity, and facilitate youth-led action at global and national level to ensure that their ideas and perspectives are better reflected in the TB response,"" said Dr Eliud Wandwalo, Head of Tuberculosis at the Global Fund.The aspiration of this forum moving forward is to advance an enabling environment for youth to play a meaningful role in ending TB. Young people have the power and intelligence to shape any future they envision and all stakeholders in the TB space need to play their part in enabling the environment for our generation of youth to end TB. As mentioned by the Indonesian Minister of Health, Budi G. Sadikin, during his opening speech, youth leadership will be the difference between success and failure in achieving the end of TB goal. We need to ensure that no young person is left behind and recognize young people as agents of change.A full program of this recording can be accessed at LINK.About Johnson &amp; JohnsonAt Johnson &amp; Johnson, we believe good health is the foundation of vibrant lives, thriving communities and forward progress.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Healthcare ETFs in 2022.2022 has been riddled with volatility, inflation, interest rates, and panicky investors. Investors' focus has shifted from cyclical and growth sectors towards defensive and value sectors amid substantially high CPI prints, an aggressive Fed, and a turbulent market. Equities have had a tough year but have recently started to see a bounce-back, after a weak CPI print was reported for October. As of December 9, the S&amp;P has shed 18% of its value year to date, the Nasdaq has dipped 30.5% since the beginning of 2022, and the Dow is down 8.50% for the year.Investors are finding refuge in consumer defensive sectors, and particularly healthcare. On December 10, Strategas head of technical analysis, Chris Verrone, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks healthcare will be a leading sector in 2023. Healthcare is one of Chris Verrone's ""Top Ideas"" as we head into the next year. The analyst noted that though ""pharmaceuticals has been a dead industry for the better part of the last 5 or 6 years"" the pharmaceutical stocks have started to ""break out"". Verrone said that ""we have seen leadership really coming from the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)"" and that he sees healthcare as a leading sector into 2023 and it is a ""theme worth playing"".While the sell offs in equities have shaken up investor confidence, investors can still work around gaining exposure to the much-anticipated leading sector in a less risky way. Investing in healthcare ETFs (exchange-traded funds) over healthcare stocks is a great way to gain exposure to the healthcare sector without having to pick and choose individual stocks. Healthcare ETFs can offer a diversified portfolio of healthcare companies, allowing investors to spread their risk across a range of different healthcare stocks. Healthcare ETFs are also generally more liquid than individual stocks, meaning that investors can enter or exit the market quickly and easily. This is beneficial for investors who don’t have a long-term investment horizon and are looking to take advantage of short-term market movements.Story continuesOverall, investing in healthcare ETFs over healthcare stocks is a great way for risk-averse investors to gain exposure to some of the best-in-class names in the healthcare sector, which include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA).

The company continues to be aggressive with share repurchases and we believe the defensive nature of Cigna’s business continues to be attractive during the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.”9. Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FHLC)YTD Return as of December 9: -4.57%The Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FHLC) has an expense ratio of 0.08% and a trailing twelve-month yield of 1.33%.

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”By investing in healthcare ETFs, investors can gain exposure to leading players in the space such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”6.

156,8602682c-6257-3483-9e03-9645c90c26da,MDT,2022-12-13,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Medtronic (NYSE:MDT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-met-slowing-returns-capital-110143740.html,1670929303,STORY,['MDT'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Medtronic:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.079 = US$6.2b ÷ (US$93b - US$14b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Therefore, Medtronic has an ROCE of 7.9%. In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for Medtronic roceIn the above chart we have measured Medtronic's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Does the ROCE Trend For Medtronic Tell Us?Things have been pretty stable at Medtronic, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Medtronic to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Medtronic is paying out 51% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesOur Take On Medtronic's ROCEIn summary, Medtronic isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. And with the stock having returned a mere 9.0% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.Medtronic could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation  on our platform quite valuable.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:MRK) may be sending bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Merck has been doing relatively well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Merck peKeen to find out how analysts think Merck's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Enough Growth For Merck?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Merck would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 159% gain to the company's bottom line. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 68% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 11% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.1% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Merck is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.As we suspected, our examination of Merck's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Story continuesWe don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Merck that you need to be mindful of.You might be able to find a better investment than Merck.

""Over the last six years, our teams have worked closely together combining our respective expertise in mRNA and immuno-oncology with a focus on improving outcomes for patients with cancer. We look forward to advancing this program into the next phase of development.""""The results of this randomized Phase 2b trial are exciting for the field. These data provide the first evidence that we can improve on the rates of recurrence-free survival achieved by PD-1 blockade in resected high-risk melanoma. These findings also provide the first randomized evidence that a personalized neoantigen approach may be beneficial in melanoma,"" said Jeffrey S. Weber, MD, PhD, principal investigator of the study and Deputy Director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone. Dr. Weber is a paid consultant for Merck and Moderna.Adverse events observed with mRNA-4157/V940 in KEYNOTE-942 were consistent with those previously reported in a Phase 1 clinical trial. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14.4% of patients who received the combination arm of mRNA-4157/V940 and KEYTRUDA versus 10% with KEYTRUDA alone.The companies plan to discuss the results with regulatory authorities and initiate a Phase 3 study in melanoma patients in 2023.In October of this year, the companies announced that Merck had exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize mRNA-4157/V940. Merck and Moderna will share costs and any profits equally under this worldwide collaboration.Personalized cancer vaccines are designed to prime the immune system so that a patient can generate a tailored antitumor response specific to their tumor mutation signature. mRNA-4157/V940 is designed to stimulate an immune response by generating specific T cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient's tumor. KEYTRUDA is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. Based on early clinical studies, combining mRNA-4157/V940 with KEYTRUDA may potentially provide an additive benefit and enhance T cell-mediated destruction of tumor cells.About mRNA-4157/V940mRNA-4157/V940 is a novel investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based personalized cancer vaccine consisting of a single synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the DNA sequence of the patient's tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and RNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity.About KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (NCT03897881)KEYNOTE-942 is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were randomized to receive mRNA-4157/V940 (nine total doses of mRNA-4157) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is recurrence-free survival, and secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival and safety.Key eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with resectable cutaneous melanoma metastatic to a lymph node and at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases, patients had a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample available suitable for sequencing, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 and patients with normal organ and marrow function reported at screening.About MelanomaMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with nearly 325,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be nearly 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and almost 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2022. The five-year survival rates are estimated to be 60.3% for stage III and 16.2% for stage IV.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA®(pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.MelanomaKEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.See additional selected indications for KEYTRUDA in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety InformationSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions.

The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

Serious drug-related side effects occurred in 14.4% of patients who received the drug-vaccine combination compared with 10% with Keytruda alone.A PROMISING FIELDIn October, Merck exercised an option to jointly develop and commercialize the treatment, known as mRNA-4157/V940, sharing costs and any profits equally. Merck and Moderna plan to discuss the results with regulatory authorities and start a phase 3 study in melanoma patients in 2023.The Merck/Moderna collaboration is one of several combining powerful drugs that unleash the immune system to target cancers with mRNA vaccine technology. These so-called neoadjuvant vaccines are designed to target highly mutated tumors.Story continuesThe personalized vaccine works in concert with Merck's Keytruda, a so-called checkpoint inhibitor designed to disable a protein called programmed death 1, or PD-1, that helps tumors to evade the immune system.To build the vaccine, researchers took samples of patients' tumors and healthy tissue. After analyzing the samples to decode their genetic sequence and isolate mutant proteins associated only with the cancer, that information was used to design a tailor-made cancer vaccine. When injected into a patient, the patient's cells act as a manufacturing plant, producing perfect copies of the mutations for the immune system to recognize and destroy.Moderna's personalized vaccine can be made in about eight weeks, a timeframe the company eventually hopes to cut in half, Burton said. Assuming the combination is eventually approved, he said Moderna would need to do a ""massive scale-up"" of its manufacturing capabilities and that company is ""all in"".Barr said the companies intend to study the approach in other types of highly mutated cancers, such as lung cancer. Other highly mutated cancers include bladder cancers and some triple negative breast cancers.Moderna mRNA competitor BioNTech SE likewise has several cancer vaccine trials in the works including one with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, which is testing a personalized BioNTech vaccine in combination with Roche's Tecentriq in patients with pancreatic cancer.Gritstone Bio Inc is testing a personalized, self-amplifying mRNA vaccine in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb's immunotherapies Opdivo and Yervoy in a midstage trial in patients with advanced solid tumors.Experts said the personalized vaccines were among several promising cancer vaccine ideas in the works after many failures in the field.“In general, I think cancer vaccines are kind of at a tipping point, and there are going to probably be a lot of vaccines coming down the pipeline in the next five years,” said Dr. Mary Lenora Disis, director of the UW Medicine Cancer Vaccine Institute in Seattle.Although the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the speed, ease and safety of mRNA vaccines, they came out of years of cancer vaccine research, she said. ""When COVID came, they were able to easily pivot."" (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen and Michael Erman; Editing by Caroline Humer, Bill Berkrot and Edwina Gibbs)]"

About 90% of new cases and deaths worldwide occurred in low- and middle-income countries that year.In Indonesia, the disease killed more than 36,000 people in 2021, the health ministry said, adding that the Bio Farma-Merck deal was meant to stem the number of cervical cancer cases in the country.Honesti Basyir, chief of Bio Farma, said in a statement the company on Tuesday signed a technology transfer deal with Merck &amp; Co, one of the world's main makers of HPV vaccines, to help produce the Merck shots in the country.Indonesian authorities aim to give the shots to 1.4 million girls next year, the company said, adding it aimed to produce 2.8 million doses given the two-shot regime recommended to inoculate against HPV-linked cervical cancer.Bio Farma did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timeline of the production.At the moment, two- or three-dose regimens are recommended, but the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization said evidence showed that one dose was as effective.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Healthcare ETFs in 2022.2022 has been riddled with volatility, inflation, interest rates, and panicky investors. Investors' focus has shifted from cyclical and growth sectors towards defensive and value sectors amid substantially high CPI prints, an aggressive Fed, and a turbulent market. Equities have had a tough year but have recently started to see a bounce-back, after a weak CPI print was reported for October. As of December 9, the S&amp;P has shed 18% of its value year to date, the Nasdaq has dipped 30.5% since the beginning of 2022, and the Dow is down 8.50% for the year.Investors are finding refuge in consumer defensive sectors, and particularly healthcare. On December 10, Strategas head of technical analysis, Chris Verrone, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks healthcare will be a leading sector in 2023. Healthcare is one of Chris Verrone's ""Top Ideas"" as we head into the next year. The analyst noted that though ""pharmaceuticals has been a dead industry for the better part of the last 5 or 6 years"" the pharmaceutical stocks have started to ""break out"". Verrone said that ""we have seen leadership really coming from the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)"" and that he sees healthcare as a leading sector into 2023 and it is a ""theme worth playing"".While the sell offs in equities have shaken up investor confidence, investors can still work around gaining exposure to the much-anticipated leading sector in a less risky way. Investing in healthcare ETFs (exchange-traded funds) over healthcare stocks is a great way to gain exposure to the healthcare sector without having to pick and choose individual stocks. Healthcare ETFs can offer a diversified portfolio of healthcare companies, allowing investors to spread their risk across a range of different healthcare stocks. Healthcare ETFs are also generally more liquid than individual stocks, meaning that investors can enter or exit the market quickly and easily. This is beneficial for investors who don’t have a long-term investment horizon and are looking to take advantage of short-term market movements.Story continuesOverall, investing in healthcare ETFs over healthcare stocks is a great way for risk-averse investors to gain exposure to some of the best-in-class names in the healthcare sector, which include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA).

New drugs impact diabetes but have also demonstrated significant weight loss for patients who are overweight and have other co-morbidity issues as a result. Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”By investing in healthcare ETFs, investors can gain exposure to leading players in the space such as Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform. CAR-T is a cell therapy that activates the body’s immune system to target cancers. This will be a key growth vector alongside M&amp;A in overcoming the company’s patent cliff.”6.

166,46a1f181-16dd-33ee-aaa0-e0e441f9a870,MOS,2022-12-13,The 7 Best Commodity Stocks to Buy for 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-commodity-stocks-buy-230136535.html,1670626896,STORY,"['RIO', 'NG=F', 'SI=F', 'GC=F', 'HG=F', 'WPM', 'BHP', 'MOS', 'NEM', 'VALE']","[While the business news cycle tends to focus on the latest technological innovations, it’s important to consider the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 as these companies undergird said advancements. As recent geopolitical flashpoints demonstrated, access to critical resources is just as important as the end products they help facilitate.Moving forward, securing supply chains to important industrial and agricultural material will likely take a priority. Therefore, even with the equities sector absorbing a beating, investors should plan ahead with the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023. Quite simply, this segment commands demand structures that probably won’t ever be replaced.BHPBHP Group$63.98RIORio Tinto$72.49VALEVale$16.94NEMNewmont Corp.$46.40WPMWheaton Precious Metals$38.99BGBunge$95.51MOSMosaic$46.81InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBHP Group (BHP)Smartphone with BHP Group logo in front of BHP website. BHP stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockBased in Australia, BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) is a multinational metal and mining specialist. In addition, the company produces natural gas and petroleum products, affording it an all-in-one business structure. At time of writing, BHP features a market capitalization of approximately $158 billion. On a year-to-date basis, BHP gained nearly 18%, storming above this year’s volatile market sessions.Fundamentally, BHP brings myriad relevancies to the table. In particular, its production of copper may help undergird the global electric vehicle rollout. According to a report by CME Group, EVs “use more than double the copper of an internal combustion engine automobile, and the metal is also used heavily in EV infrastructure.”In a way, BHP enjoys a double whammy, serving both the mobility units as well as the charging platform. Therefore, it deserves serious consideration among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023.Rio Tinto (RIO)a cart filed with gold in a gold mineSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in London, U.K., Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) bills itself as a leading global mining group that focuses on finding, mining and processing the Earth’s mineral resources. Presently, Rio Tinto commands a market cap of almost $118 billion. Since the start of the year, RIO returned shareholders roughly 8%. Most of this dynamism came recently, with shares up 20% in the trailing month.Story continuesBolstering enthusiasm for the mining specialist is its myriad product segments. As with rival BHP, Rio Tinto represents a major producer of copper, which will serve the electrification of mobility. In addition, RIO will likely benefit from its lithium business. At the moment, the U.S. and western forces tightly contest China’s dominance in this sector. Should EVs blossom, expect RIO to corral substantial demand.Another factor boosting the company’s candidacy among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 centers on the financials. Rio Tinto enjoys excellent profit margins across the board. In addition, its return on equity – a measure of how efficiently an enterprise converts equity funding to earnings – pings at 35.3%. This exceeds nearly 96% of industry competitors.Vale (VALE)Source: ShutterstockEasily representing one of the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023, Vale (NYSE:VALE) deserves more credit than its receiving. A Brazilian multinational corporation focusing on metals and mining, it’s possible that underlying political volatility detracted from Vale’s investment proposition. Nevertheless, the company has been a strong performer in 2022, returning 19% YTD.In particular, investors ought to consider Vale as one of the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 because of its nickel production. Per its corporate profile, the company represents the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world. Moving forward, nickel will almost surely undergird several industries of tomorrow.Per the Nickel Institute, the advantage of the namesake metal is that it “helps deliver higher energy density and greater storage capacity at a lower cost.” If EVs were to change mobility through economies of scale, nickel – through its integration in advanced battery technologies – will play a significant role.Newmont (NEM)An image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Denver, Colorado, Newmont (NYSE:NEM) initially presents a risky proposition among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023. As the world’s largest gold mining firm, Newmont would ordinarily command significant relevance. It still does but recent macroeconomic headwinds pose challenges to the underlying market.As the New York Times mentioned, the November jobs report came in much hotter than expected. Again, ordinarily, this news would spark optimism for the economy. However, it also means that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to contain inflation via raising the benchmark interest rate did little. Therefore, the central bank must take the gloves off. Unfortunately for NEM, this circumstance suggests even higher rate hikes next year.Still, the average spot gold price at time of writing sits just under $1,800. It’s quite possible that the fear trade inspired investors to bid up the yellow metal. In turn, Newmont may enjoy a surprising tailwind. Thus, while NEM is down nearly 23% YTD, don’t be surprised to see it rise again in 2023.Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)Macro of silverSource: Phawat / Shutterstock.comFor investors that have strong confidence in the fear trade thesis, they may want to consider adding Wheaton Precious Metals (NYSE:WPM) to their list of best commodity stocks to buy for 2023. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wheaton currently commands a market cap of nearly $18 billion. Further, WPM lost only 5.5% YTD, beating out both the benchmark equities index and many other precious metal miners.Fundamentally, Wheaton offers greater predictability because of its streaming business model. Under such an arrangement, a company makes a deal with a mining firm to purchase all or a part of the metal production at a predetermined discounted price. On paper, it’s a symbiotic relationship: miners receive upfront capital while the streaming enterprises can profit off discounted commodities.What also makes Wheaton intriguing is its exposure to the silver market. While both gold and silver feature monetary and industrial applications, silver features heavily in the latter component. As the best electrical and thermal conductor of all metals, silver is essentially permanently relevant.Bunge (BG)A Photo of a blue sign in an industrial campus showing the Bunge (BG) logo.Source: JHVEPhoto/ShutterStock.comHeadquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Bunge (NYSE:BG) is an agribusiness and food company. One of its main businesses involves international soybean exports. In addition, Bunge is involved in food processing, grain trading and fertilizer. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $14.3 billion. Since the beginning of the year, BG gained nearly 3%.While it’s not pleasant to dive into cynical arguments for the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023, Bunge aligns with harsh realities. According to the World Food Programme, the global food crisis reached unprecedented proportions. Specifically, conflict, climate shocks and the coronavirus converged to form a massive headwind in terms of feeding world populations.Like it or not, BG will likely rise in demand based on sheer pertinence and necessity. On a more positive note, the market prices BG at only 8-times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 15.8 times. Therefore, it’s one of the more undervalued ideas among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023.Mosaic (MOS)Smartphone with logo of American fertilizer producer The Mosaic Company (MOS) on screen in front of website.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comBased in Tampa, Florida, Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) mines phosphate, potash, and collects urea for fertilizer  through various international distribution networks. Per its public profile, Mosaic represents the largest producer of potash and phosphate fertilizer in the U.S. Due to exceptional relevance, MOS gained nearly 17% since its Jan. opener. However, in the trailing month, MOS dipped 5%, affording contrarians a discounted opportunity heading into the new year.Fundamentally, Mosaic ranks among the best commodity stocks to buy for 2023 based on critical need. Back in September 2020, a report published on Nature.com warned that soil erosion could aggravate the global phosphate shortage. Today, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses severe challenges for the broader fertilizer market.Again, it’s a cynical talking point yet it also speaks to harsh, unavoidable realities. On a financial note, Mosaic enjoys strong profit margins along with a return on equity of over 33%, reflecting a high-quality business. Finally, the market prices MOS at 4.9-times forward earnings, which is conspicuously undervalued.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:ROK), a Milwaukee-based industrial automation company, struggled early in the year with component shortages that prevented it from clearing its overflowing order books and rising input costs. Uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine prompted management to warn in May of lower profits for the rest of the year. Behind the frustrations, however, were indications that the business outlook remained strong, as order volume continued to grow following price increases at the end of 2021. In the recent quarter, the company reported stronger results despite ongoing supply chain issues that hindered its ability to fulfill orders. To mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, Rockwell has been accumulating inventory and redesigning certain products. We believe Rockwell will see its revenues expand as its resilience improves and supply shortages recede.”7. PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39PTC Inc.

Alteryx’s software is unique in combining a comprehensive data analytics platform with ease of use, driving dramatic improvements in business productivity and outcomes. We believe Alteryx has a large market opportunity given its ability to help data scientists as well as business analysts who have limited technical capabilities. Alteryx serves a broad base of customers across all verticals and all sizes.During the second quarter, Alteryx reported slower revenue growth relative to prior periods, and guided down full-year revenue below expectations. The revenue slowdown was partly driven by customers in certain areas that were heavily impacted by COVID-19, like small businesses and companies in the hospitality vertical, that slowed spending on new purchases and expansions. Additionally, the company noted that some customers are taking longer to make purchase decisions, extending sales cycles. These developments led to the underperformance during the third quarter. We believe the revenue slowdown is a short-term phenomenon, and continue to believe Alteryx has a large market opportunity and a long runway for multi-year growth.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Automation Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 202210 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Automation Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

United now has a total of 443 MAXs on order.United's big bet on the 787 reflects expectations for continued rising demand for long-haul travel and a desire to replace older airplanes.The big aircraft order, however, has sparked concerns about United's balance sheet. It is estimated to result in a capital expenditure of $20 billion over the next two years.Analysts at Jefferies estimate United's total capital expenditure will likely reach $50 billion through 2032 on 700 new aircraft deliveries.""There is no doubt this order needed to happen, but elevated leverage is a substantial headwind going forward,"" they wrote in a note.In a regulatory filing, however, the Chicago-based carrier said it is ""committed"" to delivering a strong balance sheet and its debt reduction plan.Its shares were down 5.5% at $41.78 in mid-day trade, while Boeing shares were up 0.2%United also said it would again delay its previously announced order for 45 Airbus A350s until 2030 ""at the earliest.""Industry sources have said this order, an expanded version of one dating back as far as 2009, is effectively in limbo after several delays and may not materialize.United CEO Scott Kirby told reporters ""the right time for 350 versus (787) conversation is when we're replacing the bulk of the 777s, which really doesn't begin to the end of the decade.""Story continuesAirbus was not immediately available for comment.Kirby said one key factor in the decision between Boeing and Airbus for its major widebody order was its current 787 fleet.""When we're trying to bring on 2,500 pilots a year and grow the airline, introducing a new fleet type slows that down dramatically,"" Kirby said.United hired 15,000 new employees in 2022, including 2,400 pilots, and is on track to hire 15,000 in 2023, including another 2,500 pilots.It expects to take 787s deliveries between 2024 and 2032 and can choose among 787-8, 9 or 10 models. United will buy 787s to replace its entire 767 fleet by 2030 and some 777s, cutting carbon emissions per seat by about 25% for the new planes.United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said the order will allow it to replace older planes with new more fuel-efficient ones with more premium seats that carry more cargo and fly faster. ""We make more money,"" Nocella said of the plan.The airline plans to tout the order at an event on Tuesday at Boeing's South Carolina factory with Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal.Both the MAX and 787 have faced problems this year.In August, Boeing finally resumed 787 deliveries after production problems forced it to suspend deliveries in May 2021. The Federal Aviation Administration in July approved Boeing's inspection and retrofit plan needed to meet certification standards and is inspecting each aircraft before delivery.Last week, Boeing suffered a setback when Congress declined to extend a looming deadline that would impose new safety standards for the MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants. United said 80 of the new 100 MAX planes it is ordering will be the MAX 10.Boeing has been lobbying for months to convince lawmakers to waive the deadline that affects its MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes and was imposed by Congress in 2020 after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.On the extension, Kirby said he was ""pretty sure it's going to get done in the next Congress"" because ""it was the right safety outcome"" but reiterated United could switch to other MAX variants or buy more Airbus planes if lawmakers did not agree.In June 2021, United announced its largest-ever order of 270 Boeing and Airbus jets, including 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 70 Airbus A321neo jets as part of its ""United Next"" growth plan.United said it was making no changes to the A321neo order.(Reporting by David Shepardson in North Charleston, S.C. and Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Alexander Smith and Andrea Ricci)]"

The analyst noted that though ""pharmaceuticals has been a dead industry for the better part of the last 5 or 6 years"" the pharmaceutical stocks have started to ""break out"". Verrone said that ""we have seen leadership really coming from the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)"" and that he sees healthcare as a leading sector into 2023 and it is a ""theme worth playing"".While the sell offs in equities have shaken up investor confidence, investors can still work around gaining exposure to the much-anticipated leading sector in a less risky way. Investing in healthcare ETFs (exchange-traded funds) over healthcare stocks is a great way to gain exposure to the healthcare sector without having to pick and choose individual stocks. Healthcare ETFs can offer a diversified portfolio of healthcare companies, allowing investors to spread their risk across a range of different healthcare stocks. Healthcare ETFs are also generally more liquid than individual stocks, meaning that investors can enter or exit the market quickly and easily. This is beneficial for investors who don’t have a long-term investment horizon and are looking to take advantage of short-term market movements.Story continuesOverall, investing in healthcare ETFs over healthcare stocks is a great way for risk-averse investors to gain exposure to some of the best-in-class names in the healthcare sector, which include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Defensive Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy. People invest in dividend stocks for several reasons. One reason is that these stocks can provide a regular source of income in the form of dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders. This can be especially appealing to investors who are looking for a way to generate a steady stream of income from their investments. Additionally, dividend stocks may be seen as a safer investment compared to other types of stocks, since companies that pay dividends are often more established and financially stable. This can provide investors with some peace of mind, knowing that their investment is less likely to be impacted by market volatility or other factors. Finally, many investors view dividend stocks as a good long-term investment, since they can provide both income and the potential for capital appreciation over time. Defensive stocks are those that hold up well during periods of economic downturns. The healthcare sector is considered one of the most reliable defensive industries because these companies benefit from growing consumer demand regardless of the overall economy.The onset of the pandemic of 2020 has shifted the dynamics of the global healthcare system. The healthcare industry in the US is the biggest in the world, which accounted for over 17% of the national GDP in 2020, according to a report by Insider Intelligence. The report also referred to the data by Deloitte and mentioned that health spending in the US will reach $8.3 trillion by 2040, up from $4 trillion in 2020.Over the years, the healthcare industry has generated solid revenues in the US. CNBC cited data from McKinsey &amp; Company and mentioned that the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 6% annually from 2021 through 2025, producing an additional $31 billion in profits. The same report mentioned that various healthcare companies in the US have given positive growth outlooks for the next few years. This year’s economic chaos also couldn’t target the sector as harshly as other industries. The S&amp;P 500 Health Care index is down by 2.36% year-to-date, versus a 17.97% decline in the broader market, as of December 12. The index gained 9.6% in October, recording its best month since April 2020, as reported by Bloomberg. Another report by AllianceBernstein stated that healthcare stocks have significantly outperformed in down markets from 2000 through June 2022.Story continuesThe solid performance of healthcare stocks can also be attributed to the fact that many health companies are dividend payers. Historically, dividend stocks have proved their mettle in periods of an economic clampdown. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) gained investors’ attention due to their strong dividend growth track records and solid returns this year.

The managed care industry is large, with healthcare spending of $4 trillion annually, and we believe that scale combined with expertise are important for success in this industry. We think that Elevance is one of a few large players who bring those strengths to bear. We estimate that Elevance will generate operating revenue north of $150 billion this year. Their size and scale allow for significant investments in technology and benefit design. We think that Elevance has good momentum and estimate that it should be able to grow its free-cash-flow per share at healthy rates despite the economy’s challenges.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Growth ETFs in 2022.Growth stocks have been punished in 2022. The Fed's aggressive rate hikes throughout the year panicked investors who abandoned ship and caused major sell offs in tech. The higher borrowing costs put a strain on tech companies' future cash flows, making investors skeptical about growth companies' ability to grow in such an environment. As of December 8, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has lost roughly about a third of its value year to date, and going into 2023, investors are still being cautious around allocating capital to growth.While growth stocks are a risky area to put your money in right now, for investors that are looking to gain exposure to growth but avoid the rampant volatility and high risk they come with, growth ETFs can be the answer. Growth ETFs are a type of exchange-traded fund that invests in growth stocks. Investors looking for higher returns and greater diversification than a traditional stock portfolio may choose to invest in growth ETFs.Investing in growth ETFs can bring many benefits over investing in individual growth stocks. ETFs offer diversification and liquidity, allowing investors to access multiple stocks from a single purchase, without having to purchase each stock separately. ETFs also provide a lower cost of entry compared to buying individual stocks, since the fees associated with ETFs are typically much lower than the fees associated with buying individual stocks. Finally, ETFs offer more stability than individual stocks, as they are less volatile and less prone to sudden price movements. This stability can help investors mitigate risk, particularly during times of market volatility. Furthermore, ETFs are easier to track and manage, as they are typically linked to an index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq, which makes it easier to gauge performance.Story continuesThis article will look at some of the best performing growth ETFs in 2022 through which investors can gain exposure to leading growth companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), without being vulnerable to huge price swings.Biotech and Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy According to Palo Alto InvestorsSource:unsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 best performing growth ETFs in 2022, we screened for non-leveraged and non-inverse technology ETFs.

Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR)YTD Return as of December 8: -22.03%The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) is an exchange traded fund that uses a full replication technique to track the performance of the Indxx Global Internet of Things Thematic Index. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.68% and yields 0.59% to investors. As of December 8, the Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) has lost 22.03% year to date, outperforming the Nasdaq by roughly 8%, and is ranked among the 10 best performing growth ETFs in 2022.The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) invests in companies that belong to the IoT industry. These companies include wearable technology, home automation, connected automotive technology, and sensors companies among others. The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) has 63 holdings and a top ten holdings concentration of 47.25%.Skyworks Solutions, Inc.

(NASDAQ:SWKS) to Outperform from Neutral and reiterated his $130 price target on the shares.Here is what Heartland Advisors had to say about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”9.

To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.56bUS$5.56bUS$7.07bUS$8.32bUS$9.20bUS$9.85bUS$10.4bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bUS$11.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x11Analyst x8Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.06%Est @ 5.54%Est @ 4.47%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.20% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$4.2kUS$4.7kUS$5.6kUS$6.1kUS$6.2kUS$6.1kUS$6.0kUS$5.8kUS$5.5kUS$5.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$56bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$12b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.0%) = US$191bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$191b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$87bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$142b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$112, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.116. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Qualcomm shares are falling this morning. Wells Fargo cut the stock to underweight from equal weight. Did keep the price target at $105.But this is the only sell equivalent rating on Qualcomm on Wall Street, which is interesting. And it's sort of in line with the firm's view overall on some of these mobile phone chip makers. They had downgraded Skyworks and Qorvo previously. Now, the downgrade piper, if you will, come in for Qualcomm with this.BRIAN SOZZI: Well, Qualcomm had a-- I mean that was a challenging third quarter they put up that really shocked the market. But look at the different tone between this downgrade to sell on Qualcomm and then what we saw from Broadcom last week, really a blowout quarter. The Street couldn't get enough of Broadcom.BRAD SMITH: Well, this is another cycle story, too, because the smartphone outlook has been rattled by the number of consumers who are looking at prices and saying, you know what? As long as my phone is still working at this point and I'm in the process of perhaps cutting costs where possible on the discretionary spending side, then I'm not necessarily looking at a new phone device that I need to buy right now or that's even partially subsidized through a phone carrier.And so within that supercycle being pushed out even further within the smartphone category, that could have a longer term impact on all of the chip manufacturers.

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

It found that the pills taken for five days soon after symptoms onset cut the risk of hospitalization and death by 90%. It has not shown that the treatment is effective in those considered at standard risk, including vaccinated patients.Pfizer signed a deal in August for Chinese drugmaker Zhejiang Huahai to produce Paxlovid in mainland China solely for patients there.The U.S. drugmaker said last year that it could produce up to 120 million courses of Paxlovid this year, but it is not immediately known how many it has produced so far.In the United States, Pfizer has delivered more than 9 million courses and patients have used over 6 million courses of the treatment, according to government data.Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed with German partner BioNTech using mRNA technology, is not approved for use in China.

A judge rejected the network’s bid to toss the case in December 2021. A Fox spokesperson declined to comment.""From the highest levels down, Fox knowingly spread lies,"" Dominion said in a statement.Murdoch, 91, is the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case, which is part of a multi-front legal campaign by Dominion against Fox and other conservative outlets and commentators who accused the company of conspiring to oust Trump.The deposition comes as special committees of the boards of directors for News Corp and Murdoch-controlled Fox Corp consider a proposal from Murdoch to re-combine, nearly a decade after the companies split.Murdoch will be questioned via videoconference on Tuesday and Wednesday by lawyers for Dominion, according to a filing in Delaware Superior Court. The session will not be open to the public.Dominion has also sought communications from Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox News personnel as it looks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove in order to prevail in defamation cases.Doug Mirell, a defamation lawyer who has followed the litigation, said he believes Dominion has an ""air-tight"" case for actual malice because Fox hosts pressed forward with vote-rigging allegations ""well after it was quite clear that these claims were demonstrably false.""Story continuesDominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances where, in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden.On Nov. 30, 2020, for example, Powell appeared on Sean Hannity’s program, where she falsely stated that Dominion machines “ran an algorithm that shaved off votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden. And they used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump.”Murdoch’s high-stakes deposition on Tuesday comes as Dominion has spent the past several months questioning a parade of Fox News hosts, executives and producers.On Dec. 5, Murdoch’s eldest son and executive chair and CEO of Fox Corp, Lachlan, sat for a deposition in Los Angeles. Murdoch’s other son, James Murdoch, was questioned in October.Fox hosts and co-hosts Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Jeanine Pirro and Bret Baier have also been questioned in recent months, court records show, as well as former host Lou Dobbs. Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace have also sat for depositions.A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17.(Reporting by Jack Queen and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Amy Stevens and Matthew Lewis)]"

212,308bc0ec-2480-3af2-b0b3-b65a4341dec4,IBM,2022-12-13,Top 15 Digital Transformation Companies in the US,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-digital-transformation-companies-200345538.html,1670875425,STORY,"['ADBE', 'HPE', 'WDAY', 'DELL', 'NOW', 'IBM', 'CTSH', 'SAP', 'CRM', 'EQIX', 'MSFT', 'AVGO', 'GOOGL']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 digital transformation companies in the U.S. For more companies, head on over to Top 5 Digital Transformation Companies in the U.S. Digital transformation is a diverse field and one that continues to evolve with time. As the name suggests, this sector simply involves the transformation of traditional, analog sources of data or business processes into digital data and processes for a host of different benefits. It traces its way back to the 1950s when the semiconductor was invented and allowed the conversion of analog computing to digital computing. The next big shifts started to occur from the 1960s onward, with the introduction of computer aided design in manufacturing in the 70s. Before this, digital planning systems started to make their way across corporations as a method of letting them manage their inventory in the 1960s. From then on, these systems were expanded to also bring materials requirement planning (MRP) and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) to firms. All these were brought under the umbrella of what is now termed enterprise resource planning (ERP), a leading technology that continues to evolve today and is at the heart of what is termed a digital transformation.However, backend processes are not the only ones that have been digitally transformed.  The late 1990s were the era of the Internet, and naturally, this was blended with the newly set up ERP systems. This integration enabled firms to communicate with each other to share different information such as delivery status, order invoices, and demand forecasts. The latter is particularly important for avoiding the bullwhip effect, which is the result of a demand mismatch between two companies at different ends of the supply chain. Finally, another aspect of digital transformation is the digital storefront,  which allows companies to interact with customers over the Internet.Naturally, the vast scope and the countless benefits offered by digital transformation lead to some impressive market valuations. A fresh report from Polaris Market Research estimates that the industry was worth $588 billion in 2021. From then, until 2030, the research firm expects it to grow at a strong compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6% to be worth an estimated $3.7 trillion. Polaris Market further outlines that the healthcare segment was the largest portion of digital transformation in 2021, and North America was the dominating region.Story continuesToday's piece will focus on some leading digital transformation companies that offer their products and services in the segment. The top players are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom Inc.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this refiner have returned -11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has lost 0.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $6.02 per share, indicating a change of +363.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.41 points to a change of +937.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.96 indicates a change of -41.1% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -9.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MPC _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Marathon Petroleum, the consensus sales estimate of $32.19 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -9.6%. The $171.5 billion and $123.31 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +41.8% and -28.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMarathon Petroleum reported revenues of $47.24 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.8%. EPS of $7.81 for the same period compares with $0.73 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.67 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +32.43%. The EPS surprise was +14.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Marathon Petroleum is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Marathon Petroleum. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Molson Coors Beverage’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage Is Molson Coors Beverage Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Molson Coors Beverage is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Molson Coors Beverage’s ratio of 22.94x is below its peer average of 32.6x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Beverage industry. Molson Coors Beverage’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from Molson Coors Beverage?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Molson Coors Beverage's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 95%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since TAP is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TAP for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy TAP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.If you'd like to know more about Molson Coors Beverage as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

217,3f946efa-4b66-3867-975f-40ff78ed26e1,TAP,2022-12-13,Why Molson Coors (TAP) is Marching Ahead of the Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-molson-coors-tap-marching-143302238.html,1670855582,STORY,"['TAP-A', 'KOF']","[Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP has been gaining from robust pricing actions, gains from a revitalization plan and premiumization of its global portfolio. Strength across its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands, as well as its beyond-beer approach, bodes well. The company remains on track with increased investments toward core brands and innovations.This led to decent third-quarter 2022 results, wherein sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Net sales rose 4% to $2,935.2 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 7.9% due to positive pricing and a favorable sales mix stemming from portfolio premiumization, offset by a decline in financial volumes. Net sales per hectoliter increased 9.2% on a brand-volume basis, driven by strong net pricing and a favorable sales mix from portfolio premiumization.Driven by these factors, management retained the 2022 view. Net sales are projected to grow in mid-single digits in constant currency. Underlying EBIT is likely to grow year over year in high-single digits in constant currency.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConsequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 16.5% year to date against the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Key Growth DriversMolson Coors is on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. It intends to invest in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space; expand in adjacencies and beyond beer, without hampering the support for its existing large brands; and create digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.To facilitate these investments, the company plans to generate savings of nearly $150 million by simplifying its structure. It is also building on the strength of its iconic core brands. Additionally, the company’s cost-savings program, announced in 2020, targets delivering cost savings of $600 million over three years.The company remains focused on growing its market share through innovation and premiumization. To accelerate portfolio premiumization, the company has been aggressively growing its above-premium portfolio in the past few years. Molson Coors highlighted that it is making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas.The company’s U.S. above-premium portfolio witnessed sales that outpaced its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by the rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.Story continuesWhat’s Hurting Molson Coors?Despite such strategic endeavors, TAP continues to witness lower brand and financial volume. In third-quarter 2022, Molson Coors’ worldwide brand and financial volumes fell 2% and 0.2%, respectively, due to sluggishness in the America segment, owing to lower Canada shipments and continued impacts of the Québec labor strike.  Molson Coors has been witnessing weakened consumer demand across the beer industry in its Central and Eastern European regions. This is mainly due to muted disposable income stemming from inflationary pressure. Management expects global inflationary pressures to remain a headwind. Also, the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and consumer inflationary pressures across Central and Eastern European countries remain concerning.ConclusionWe believe that brand strength, product innovation, pricing actions, premiumization of its global portfolio and revitalization plan are likely to drive growth further for Molson Coors. Topping it, long-term growth of 3.9% and a VGM Score of B raise optimism in the stock.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF, e.l.f.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, The AES Corp. AES, NRG Energy Inc. NRG, NiSource Inc. NI and PPL Corp. PPL.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Utility Stocks to Stay Safe in a Likely Volatile WeekWe are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.9%, 17.5% and 29.7%, respectively. Fluctuations in the market are also likely this week as the decision regarding the next round of interest rate hike will come on Dec 14, after the conclusion of the Fed FOMC meeting.Moreover, several major economic data of November such as, consumer price index, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization will be released this week. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthened your portfolio. We have selected five utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are - American Electric Power Co. Inc., The AES Corp.,NRG Energy Inc., NiSource Inc. and PPL Corp.Utilities Immune to the Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Story continuesConsequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Year to date, out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, 10 are in negative territory, except the energy sector. Of these 10 sectors, utilities suffered the least. The utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) dropped marginally by 1.1%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

APD recently announced its plans to enter into a joint venture with The AES Corporation AES to build a green hydrogen production facility in Wilbarger County, TX. The companies will invest approximately $4 billion to build and operate this facility under a 30-year contract.The plant will serve the growing demand for zero-carbon intensity fuels and produce an enormously clean source of energy. It will employ wind and solar energy and be the largest green hydrogen facility in the United States to do so by far.This joint venture will have an electrolyzer capacity that can produce more than 200 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. Moreover, the project can generate about 1.4 GW of wind and solar power. It is anticipated that the facility will reduce more than 50 million metric tons of CO2 throughout the project. Both parties will have an equal share in the renewable energy and electrolyzer assets. Air Products will be the exclusive off-taker and marketer of green hydrogen.This project is capable of generating approximately 1,300 construction, 115 permanent operations and 200 transportation and distribution jobs. On top of that, the project can initiate about $500 million in tax benefits to Texas during its course.In the forthcoming years, the demand for green hydrogen for mobility and industrial uses is anticipated to increase substantially nationwide. APD and AES expect the facility to be ready to start its commercial operations in 2027.

We have selected five utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are - American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, The AES Corp. AES, NRG Energy Inc. NRG NiSource Inc. NI and PPL Corp. PPL.Utilities Immune to the Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Story continuesUtility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Year to date, out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, 10 are in negative territory, except the energy sector. Of these 10 sectors, utilities suffered the least. The utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) dropped marginally by 1.1%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers.

Today we have his full report — which sticks with his bullish theme.“On the tour section at GM HQ, we were able to see the company’s battery &amp; innovation facility along with the vehicle design studios, the two critical areas GM is betting the company’s future on for the coming decades,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. “After the day, it was clear to us that GM is at an inflection point in innovation, spearheading the overall shift to EV with vehicle quality, a goal-oriented employee base, and profitability/cash flow all in mind.”Ives's visit to GM and subsequent analysis of the trip comes after last month’s GM investor day event in New York City, where the company updated its EV gameplan.The automaker said then that its EV portfolio will be “solidly profitable in 2025” in North America, as the company scales EV capacity to more than 1 million units annually. The milestone is years ahead of schedule, when it originally expected margins for EVs to be comparable to gas-powered cars by 2030.The first big factor as to why Ives is bullish on GM is that he believes the Street is not recognizing the full value of GM’s proprietary battery tech, which is the Ultium platform.“With the ability to use the same battery platform for almost any different chassis, numerous vehicles are now able to be built on top of the same exact platform, extensively lowering the company’s traditional large R&amp;D costs an automaker would see either in ICE vehicles or retrofitting battery packs into modern cars when releasing new vehicles,” he says.Ives says the next generation of Ultium batteries will help reduce costs for GM, as well as being an innovation driver as well. Ives call Ultium GM’s “secret sauce.”The second component of the GM EV story for Ives is the ramp up in design and engineering. While GM has been slower than its rival Ford (F) in terms of getting multiple EVs in the marketplace, Ives believes patience will pay off for the automaker as GM has taken that time to improve the Ultium platform in order to roll out a number of EVs at the same time, instead of piecemeal.Story continuesIves says the “highlight” of the trip was seeing where GM takes designer sketches to final product, with the Ultium platform giving the company a cost-effective way to produce and bring “cutting edge” vehicles to the market.“With GM set to release a number of new EV models over the next 12 to 18 months, this pivot to an EV future is key to GM’s growth story as the company continues to invest in its Ultium platform while expanding its offering across the board,” Ives said.Wedbush maintained its “outperform” rating on GM after the visit and $46 price target.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

United now has a total of 443 MAXs on order.United's big bet on the 787 reflects expectations for continued rising demand for long-haul travel and a desire to replace older airplanes.The big aircraft order, however, has sparked concerns about United's balance sheet. It is estimated to result in a capital expenditure of $20 billion over the next two years.Analysts at Jefferies estimate United's total capital expenditure will likely reach $50 billion through 2032 on 700 new aircraft deliveries.""There is no doubt this order needed to happen, but elevated leverage is a substantial headwind going forward,"" they wrote in a note.In a regulatory filing, however, the Chicago-based carrier said it is ""committed"" to delivering a strong balance sheet and its debt reduction plan.Its shares were down 5.5% at $41.78 in mid-day trade, while Boeing shares were up 0.2%United also said it would again delay its previously announced order for 45 Airbus A350s until 2030 ""at the earliest.""Industry sources have said this order, an expanded version of one dating back as far as 2009, is effectively in limbo after several delays and may not materialize.United CEO Scott Kirby told reporters ""the right time for 350 versus (787) conversation is when we're replacing the bulk of the 777s, which really doesn't begin to the end of the decade.""Story continuesAirbus was not immediately available for comment.Kirby said one key factor in the decision between Boeing and Airbus for its major widebody order was its current 787 fleet.""When we're trying to bring on 2,500 pilots a year and grow the airline, introducing a new fleet type slows that down dramatically,"" Kirby said.United hired 15,000 new employees in 2022, including 2,400 pilots, and is on track to hire 15,000 in 2023, including another 2,500 pilots.It expects to take 787s deliveries between 2024 and 2032 and can choose among 787-8, 9 or 10 models. United will buy 787s to replace its entire 767 fleet by 2030 and some 777s, cutting carbon emissions per seat by about 25% for the new planes.United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said the order will allow it to replace older planes with new more fuel-efficient ones with more premium seats that carry more cargo and fly faster. ""We make more money,"" Nocella said of the plan.The airline plans to tout the order at an event on Tuesday at Boeing's South Carolina factory with Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal.Both the MAX and 787 have faced problems this year.In August, Boeing finally resumed 787 deliveries after production problems forced it to suspend deliveries in May 2021. The Federal Aviation Administration in July approved Boeing's inspection and retrofit plan needed to meet certification standards and is inspecting each aircraft before delivery.Last week, Boeing suffered a setback when Congress declined to extend a looming deadline that would impose new safety standards for the MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants. United said 80 of the new 100 MAX planes it is ordering will be the MAX 10.Boeing has been lobbying for months to convince lawmakers to waive the deadline that affects its MAX 7 and MAX 10 airplanes and was imposed by Congress in 2020 after two fatal 737 MAX crashes killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.On the extension, Kirby said he was ""pretty sure it's going to get done in the next Congress"" because ""it was the right safety outcome"" but reiterated United could switch to other MAX variants or buy more Airbus planes if lawmakers did not agree.In June 2021, United announced its largest-ever order of 270 Boeing and Airbus jets, including 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 70 Airbus A321neo jets as part of its ""United Next"" growth plan.United said it was making no changes to the A321neo order.(Reporting by David Shepardson in North Charleston, S.C. and Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago; additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Alexander Smith and Andrea Ricci)]"

This historic purchase is the next chapter in the ambitious United Next plan and will bolster the airline's leadership role in global travel for years to come.United Airlines Unveils Historic Order to Purchase Up To 200 New Boeing Widebody PlanesUnited expects to take delivery of the new widebody planes between 2024 and 2032 and can choose among the 787-8, 9 or 10 models, providing flexibility to support a wide range of routes.United also exercised options to purchase 44 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft for delivery between 2024 and 2026 - consistent with the United Next 2026 capacity plan - and ordered 56 more MAX aircraft for delivery between 2027 and 2028.The airline now expects to take delivery of about 700 new narrow and widebody aircraft by the end of 2032, including an average of more than two every week in 2023 and more than three every week in 2024.Additionally, United continues its unprecedented effort to upgrade the interiors of its existing fleet.

This expansion includes service to London-Heathrow, where the airline added five new daily flights, for a total of 23 daily flights planned for summer of 2023, including an hourly shuttle there from New York/Newark.United now serves double-digit international destinations from each of its U.S. hubs:78 via Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)56 via George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)45 via Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)41 via Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)32 via San Francisco International Airport (SFO)18 via Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)17 via Denver International Airport (DEN)""Our widebody fleet will be re-energized by these new 787 deliveries and further strengthen what we do best: connect people and unite the world with modern, customer friendly and fuel-efficient aircraft,"" said Andrew Nocella, United's EVP and Chief Commercial Officer.

This combination represents a significant advantage for our business for years to come and another reason for business and leisure customers to choose United.""#1 Across the AtlanticThis past summer United became the largest airline between the U.S. and the Atlantic region, consisting of Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa.Earlier this year, United kicked off the largest transatlantic expansion in its history with the launch of ten new flights – including to several places no other North American carrier serves like Amman, Jordan; Tenerife, Canary Islands; Ponta Delgada, Azores and Mallorca, Spain.Next summer, United's Atlantic expansion will continue with new service to three cities – Malaga, Spain, Stockholm, Sweden; and Dubai, UAE – as well as six more flights to some of the most popular destinations in Europe, including Rome, Paris, Barcelona, London, Berlin and Shannon.In total, United will fly nonstop to 37 cities in Europe, Africa, India and the Middle East next summer, more than all other U.S. airlines combined.#1 Across the PacificUnited is also the largest carrier from the U.S. across the Pacific and will serve 20 transpacific routes at the beginning of 2023, with more returning throughout the year. Excluding Mainland China and Hong Kong, United's capacity across the Pacific will exceed 2019 levels next year.The most notable expansion in this region has been in the South Pacific, and in Australia in particular. United was the only airline to operate continuously between the U.S. and Australia during the pandemic, maintaining a vital supply chain link and helping families stay connected. As Australia gears up for its first full southern summer tourist season in nearly three years, United will have more flights connecting Australia and the U.S. than any other airline.United offers a total of six nonstop routes that link Australia's three largest cities – Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – with three key U.S. tourist and trade hubs – San Francisco, Los Angeles and Houston. Plus, the recently launched codeshare partnership with Virgin Australia also allows travelers to make easy connections to more than 20 additional cities within Australia, helping support the country's broader economic recovery.United also continues to build back other transpacific services. In January 2023, the airline plans to fly 48 times per week from the Continental U.S. to Japan, including new service from Newark/New York to Haneda and the relaunch of San Francisco to Osaka.New Flights to Africa, India &amp; the Middle EastIn the last three years, United added five new nonstop flights to four cities in Africa and now offers nonstop routes to Cape Town and Johannesburg from Newark/New York and to Accra, Ghana; Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town from Washington D.C.United's recent agreement with Emirates, which begins with a new nonstop flight between Newark/New York and Dubai, UAE in March 2023, will significantly expand the airline's reach in the Middle East and India, opening easy connections to nearly 100 cities in the region on Emirates and its sister airline flydubai.Strategic CollaborationsUnited has forged alliances and strategic agreements with many of the world's leading global airlines and travel companies to give customers even more options and help make world travel more accessible. The airline was a founding member of Star Alliance, giving customers reciprocal travel and loyalty program benefits on 26 global airlines and allowing easy connections almost anywhere in the world. United has close working relationships with its joint venture partners the Lufthansa Group, Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, and Air New Zealand and holds codeshare agreements with leading airlines like Virgin Australia and Emirates.The 787 Customer ExperienceEach United 787 features four on-board products: United Polaris business class, United Premium Plus, Economy Plus®, and economy, providing an elevated and consistent experience throughout the airline's international widebody fleet. Consistently ranked by customers as the highest scoring aircraft in United's fleet in terms of overall satisfaction, all 787 aircraft also include larger windows, LED lighting, a lower cabin altitude setting and higher humidity, so customers feel more hydrated and better rested upon arrival.""Our fleet of 787 aircraft brings together the best parts of the United customer experience - helpful, friendly service, terrific amenities and best-in-class technology,"" said Linda Jojo, United's EVP and Chief Customer Officer. ""And customers just love our Polaris products – from our airport lounges, amenities and seat-back screens to big seats that turn into beds, luxury blankets and pillows and plenty of room for storage. We're proud to offer customers more lie-flat seat options than all other U.S. carriers combined.""Each United Polaris business class seat offers all-aisle access, wool blend seat covers for breathability and a memory foam layer for extra comfort, as well as 16-inch high-definition touch screens and noise-reducing headphones that include free access to more than 1,000 movies, TV shows, audio playlists, podcasts, and games.All United Premium Plus seats include a six-inch recline, 13-inch seat back screens, and an amenity kit with pillow and blanket at every seat. Economy Plus and economy customers have 10-inch screens at every seat.The seatback experience throughout the entire 787 aircraft also includes United's Inflight Entertainment System (IFE) with accessibility features for people with hearing or visual disabilities. And United plans to add Bluetooth connectivity throughout new 787 aircraft so customers have the option of using their own headphones.Premium Onboard AmenitiesUnited Polaris customers also receive custom Saks Fifth Avenue bedding that includes a duvet, day blanket, and pillow - items like mattress pads, slippers and United's signature cooling gel pillows are available upon request. Plus, earlier this year United debuted new amenity kits from Away that include Sunday Riley skincare products.United Polaris LoungeEvery United Polaris customer also has access to the United Polaris Lounge – with locations in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark/New York, San Francisco and Washington D.C. – with amenities that include spa-like shower facilities, a full-service restaurant and curated buffet, as well as daybeds with soft lighting and white noise.Creating Tens of Thousands of CareersToday's order also is expected to lead to increased hiring – the airline hired 15,000 people in 2022 and is on track to add another 15,000 next year. For more information about United's recruiting and hiring efforts, visit careers.united.com.""When I look at our culture and the trajectory of our brand and company, I know this is the best time to join United Airlines,"" said Kate Gebo, United's EVP of Human Resources and Labor Relations. ""We're not just creating jobs – these are long-lasting careers that offer great pay, outstanding benefits and flight privileges to see the world. And the best part is we're actively hiring across every role at the airline.""PilotsUnited continues to see strong interest in pilot roles, from military and civilian backgrounds as well as from other carriers. In 2022, the airline hired about 2,400 pilots and plans to add more than 2,500 pilots in 2023, with a goal to add 10,000 pilots this decade.Earlier this year, United opened the United Aviate Academy, with a goal of training 5,000 new pilots at the school by 2030 with the goal of at least half being women or people of color. To date, the airline has received more than 22,000 applications for admissions - nearly 70% of applicants are women or people of color - and the Aviate Academy's 2022 graduating class is more than 60% diverse.Flight AttendantsUnited will hire more than 18,000 new flight attendants in the coming years with more than 4,000 expected to join the team in 2023 - earlier this year, the airline received 8,000 applications in less than 72 hours for open flight attendant roles.Early next year, United will open a state-of-the-art Inflight Training Center in Houston featuring 50,000 square feet of classroom space and an aquatics center for safety training. The new facility allows for the training of more than 8,000 flight attendants per year and provides a more realistic customer service environment that will better prepare those in training to deliver the best possible experience to customers.Aircraft MaintenanceUnited expects to hire more than 7,000 maintenance technicians by 2026 to provide upkeep of its fleet and ensure facilities meet the needs of employees and customers. The airline hired more than 1,000 aircraft mechanics already this year and expects to add 2,000 more in 2023.In November 2022, United launched Calibrate, a 36-month apprenticeship program to grow and diversify its pipeline of aircraft technicians – through that program, the airline plans to train 1,000 new aircraft technicians by 2026, with the goal of at least half being women or people of color.Airport OperationsThis year alone, United hired more than 8,500 new customer service, ramp, and gate agents and expects to add another 7,000 in 2023. These are critical roles in United's operation - the people who work the gate or on the tarmac help ensure customers have a safe, enjoyable and on-time travel experience.Local HiringIn 2023, United expects to hire across each its U.S. hubs: Better Fuel Efficiency &amp; Lower Carbon EmissionsUnited has set an ambitious goal to be 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To get there, the airline is introducing more fuel-efficient aircraft into its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel and other decarbonization technologies.According to Boeing, the 787 Dreamliner contributes up to an 25% improvement in fuel efficiency and lower carbon emissions per seat compared with the airplanes it replaces through new engines, an expanded use of lightweight composite materials, more efficient systems applications and modern aerodynamics.Boeing has worked to reduce the sound footprint - the distance across which disturbing noise is heard - for the 787 Dreamliners, which incorporate new technologies to ensure that no sound of 85 decibels - about the level of loud traffic heard from the side of the road - leaves the airport boundaries. In fact, the noise footprint of the 787 is more than 60 percent smaller than those of the airplanes it replaces.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulation.Our actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including, without limitation, the following: any delay or inability of the Company to realize the expected benefits of the transactions, the adverse impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity; execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan; changes in our network strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders, costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into less favorable aircraft orders, as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned; any failure to effectively manage, and receive anticipated benefits and returns from, acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other portfolio actions; adverse publicity, harm to our brand, reduced travel demand, potential tort liability and voluntary or mandatory operational restrictions as a result of an accident, catastrophe or incident involving us, our regional carriers, our codeshare partners or another airline; the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity, including as a result of alliances, joint business arrangements or other consolidations; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft and certain parts, and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries, additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers; disruptions to our regional network and United Express flights provided by third-party regional carriers; unfavorable economic and political conditions in the United States and globally (including inflationary pressures); reliance on third-party service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services; extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space, facility and infrastructure constrains at our hubs or other airports; geopolitical conflict, terrorist attacks or security events; any damage to our reputation or brand image; our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of, or failure to effectively integrate and implement, the technology or systems; increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach; increased use of social media platforms by us, our employees and others; the impacts of union disputes, employee strikes or slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions on our operations; any failure to attract, train or retain skilled personnel, including our senior management team or other key employees; the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry; current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement, order or arrangement relating to these actions; costs, liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change, including our climate goals; high and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel (including as a result of the Russia-Ukraine military conflict); the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations, the possibility we may seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the short-term, and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business; failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt, including our MileagePlus® financing agreements; the impacts of the proposed phaseout of the London interbank offer rate; limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes; our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; fluctuations in the price of our common stock; the impacts of seasonality, weather events, infrastructure and other factors associated with the airline industry; increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage and other risks and uncertainties set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. In addition, certain forward-looking outlook provided in this press release relies on assumptions about the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of the return to a more stable business environment, the volatility of aircraft fuel prices, customer behavior changes and return in demand for air travel, among other things (together, the ""Recovery Process""). The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken in response may continue to impact many aspects of our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways, including labor shortages (including reductions in available staffing and related impacts to the Company's flight schedules and reputation), facility closures and related costs and disruptions to our and our business partners' operations, reduced travel demand and consumer spending, increased operating costs, supply chain disruptions, logistics constraints, volatility in the price of our securities, our ability to access capital markets and volatility in the global economy and financial markets generally. If the actual Recovery Process differs materially from our assumptions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business could be worse than expected, and our actual results may be negatively impacted and may vary materially from our expectations and projections. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change. For instance, we regularly monitor future demand and booking trends and adjust capacity, as needed. As such, our actual flown capacity may differ materially from currently published flight schedules or current estimations.United Airlines logo.

233,cdb00bd2-82a2-35ce-ba8c-95e5c17a4968,PNC,2022-12-13,Report Finds CFOs and Treasurers Remain Optimistic; Focus on Reducing Inefficiencies and Streamlining Operations,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-finds-cfos-treasurers-remain-090000698.html,1670922000,STORY,['PNC'],"[GTreasurySurvey details challenges and ambitions as organizations navigate digital transformation initiatives amid economic uncertaintyPressure Points, Payments &amp; Plans for Automation: The Road Ahead for CFOs and TreasurersSurvey details challenges and ambitions as organizations navigate digital transformation initiatives amid economic uncertaintyCHICAGO and PITTSBURGH, Dec. 13, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTreasury, a treasury and risk management platform provider, and PNC Bank, one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the U.S., today announced the release of a joint survey report entitled, Pressure Points, Payments &amp; Plans for Automation: The Road Ahead for CFOs and Treasurers, which explores the current state of CFO and corporate treasury strategy, execution and outlook. The full report, conducted by Topline Strategy and commissioned by GTreasury and PNC Bank, is available here: https://resources.gtreasury.com/PNC-Report-2022.htmlThe research paints a picture of a turbulent road ahead for CFOs and treasury leaders over the next few years—but one that respondents view with somewhat surprising optimism. The majority (85%) of CFOs and treasurers surveyed expect to see either significant or moderate company growth throughout the remainder of 2022 and into 2023, but that optimism is grounded in the fact that nearly half (49%) of these leaders identified cost efficiency as the primary strategic imperative for the New Year.“CFOs and treasurers seem to have clear goals in mind when it comes to achieving more accurate, more efficient, and more automated treasury practices—and they are eager to harness new technology to get there,” said Howard Forman, senior vice president and head of Digital Channels for PNC Bank. “Clearly, CFOs have an especially close eye on costs right now, but smart use of modern technology, such as embedded finance applications and automation, will reduce costly or redundant inefficiencies, while giving treasurers the best tools available to do their jobs.”Among the highlights from the report:Finance departments are lagging with their digital transformation journey. The majority (58%) of companies have not progressed in making a formalized digital transformation plan or approach to meet marketplace demands. However, the tide seems to be changing with many CFOs and treasurers identifying real-time payments and ‘full-service’ treasury systems as good investments.Treasury teams aren’t growing in size—but are asked to do more with less. Most treasury teams are small but face rising expectations from management teams and leadership. 70% of treasury teams have five or fewer team members but manage companies with more than five subsidiaries, which is likely why 53% of surveyed treasurers are hyper-focused on improving operational efficiency.Outsourcing treasury functions is increasing. Smaller treasury teams, larger workloads, and higher expectations have put outsourcing on the shortlist for businesses looking to get more done with less. About one-quarter of companies now outsource some treasury functions to partners to tap into expertise and efficiency advantages, with banks receiving more than 50% of that business. Outsourced technology and resources will not only help companies navigate through an uncertain market, but also potentially unlock key financial opportunities and add more business value.Story continues“For CFOs and treasurers, this report offers insight into how many of their peers are navigating a particularly critical and turbulent era,” said Renaat Ver Eecke, CEO at GTreasury. “Not only will organizations be affected by economic headwinds out of their control, but the competitive disadvantages of failing to modernize and automate key functionality within finance and corporate treasury are growing by the day. The report provides a window into how businesses are positioning themselves for more digital transformation and growth even as macro conditions remain very much uncertain.”Pressure Points, Payments &amp; Plans for Automation: The Road Ahead for CFOs and Treasurers aims to help educate finance and treasury leaders across the industry and advance finance automation. Participants included 93 finance executives and corporate treasurers, which came from a cross-section of more than 20 industries and represented both large and mid-sized enterprises.

(NYSE:PNC) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 84% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnc-financial-services-group-inc-140108235.html,1670853668,STORY,['PNC'],"[Every investor in The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PNC Financial Services Group. View our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in PNC Financial Services Group. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see PNC Financial Services Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in PNC Financial Services Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.3% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$211m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 15% stake in PNC Financial Services Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with PNC Financial Services Group , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

237,2da81429-65ed-32f7-b308-befc53df94e3,ISRG,2022-12-13,3 Medical Stocks With Solid Growth Drivers to Keep Track Of,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-medical-stocks-solid-growth-141002531.html,1670854202.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'MRNA']","[The year 2022 has roiled investors as the three key broad indices — S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq — are about to end the year with significant negative returns. The decline in the broader market indices has pulled down the price of shares of many strong companies that resulted in significant losses for investors. However, there is some hope for growth in 2023 amid recessionary fears.Investors must note that bear markets do not continue forever. Hence, a bull market will eventually start, although the timeline is not clear yet. Thus, stocks with strong fundamentals and whose share prices have gained amid broader market decline, are likely to create robust wealth for investors when the bull market sets in.Here we discuss three medical stocks — Axsome Therapeutics AXSM, Moderna MRNA and Intuitive Surgical ISRG — that have rallied so far this year amid the broader market decline or that are ripe for a rebound after declining for the better part of 2022, making their valuation cheaper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAxsome TherapeuticsShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 98.1% so far this year despite a decline in the broader markets. The rally in the company’s share price has been driven by two promising drugs in its portfolio — Sunosi and Auvelity. While Axsome bought the sleep disorder drug, Sunosi, from Jazz Pharmaceuticals earlier in 2022, it launched the antidepressant drug, Auvelity, in October.Apart from these two commercial drugs, Axsome is planning to submit a regulatory application to the FDA seeking approval for its migraine treatment candidate — AXS-07 — in the third quarter of 2023. Moreover, the company is also evaluating a candidate — AXS-05 — for Alzheimer's disease agitation in a late-stage study, which can also likely lead to a new commercial drug in a couple of years.There are several other candidates in Axsome’s pipeline in early- to mid-stage studies that will likely drive the company’s prospects in the upcoming years.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and earnings per share (EPS) for 2023 suggests growth of 287.6% and 23%, respectively.Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. PriceAxsome Therapeutics, Inc. PriceAxsome Therapeutics, Inc. price | Axsome Therapeutics, Inc. QuoteModernaThis Zacks Rank #3 company created a whopping amount of wealth for its investors in 2020, following its success with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine — Spikevax. However, with the risk of coronavirus waning, there has been a significant decline in Moderna’s share price in 2022. However, a new growth phase is likely to set in with annual vaccination for COVID-19 in plans. Moreover, the company will start to offer its COVID-19 vaccine directly to distributors instead of governments, which may lead to higher price realization. This may create a potential opportunity worth billions of dollars every year in annual COVID-19 vaccine sales.Moreover, Moderna is developing multiple other vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus, flu as well as vaccine for certain cancers. Moderna expects the flu and RSV vaccine candidates to hit the market within three years. The company is also developing a combined vaccine for flu and COVID-19.Although shares of Moderna have declined 30.2% so far this year, the shares have been rallying since mid of October. Moderna’s long-term prospects seem encouraging.Earnings are likely to grow 6.5% for Moderna over the next five years.Moderna, Inc. PriceModerna, Inc. PriceModerna, Inc. price | Moderna, Inc. QuoteIntuitive SurgicalThe company’s services had been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to lower top-line growth. The hospitals postponed surgeries as COVID-19 cases started piling up as well as due to stay-at-home restrictions across several economies put in place to contain the spread of the virus.However, Intuitive Surgical’s prospects seem to be promising with continued recovery in procedural volumes. A potential recovery in demand for its robotic surgery machines will further fuel growth for the company.Moreover, Intuitive Surgical’s leadership position — nearly 80% of the market — in surgical robots is likely to benefit the company well, as hospitals are likely to stick to Intuitive Surgical for these high-ticket purchases.These favorable opportunities are likely to deliver top-and bottom-line growth for Intuitive Surgical going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and EPS for 2023 suggests growth of 11.7% and 13.5%, respectively. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

240,79ba738b-c7d4-3725-9b99-601b3d918ca1,RCL,2022-12-13,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Royal Caribbean (RCL) Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-royal-153203006.html,1670859123,STORY,"['RCL', 'CROX', 'H']","[Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL is likely to benefit from improving booking volumes, digital initiatives and fleet expansion efforts. This and the increased focus on Trifecta Program bode well. However, inflationary and supply chain challenges raise concerns.Let us discuss why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.Key CatalystsShares of Royal Caribbean have gained 21% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 0.2% growth. The company has been benefitting from strong demand for cruising, relaxation in COVID-related protocols and acceleration in booking volumes. During the third quarter of 2022, booking volumes for 2022 sailings were up 50% from the 2019 levels. During the third quarter, the company reported accelerating demand for sailings in 2023. It stated that booking volumes for 2023 doubled during the third quarter compared with the second quarter of 2022. The company noted better than expected load factors, owing to a rise in close-in bookings. It also stated that pricing (including and excluding FCCs) remains elevated from 2019 levels. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had nearly $3.8 billion in customer deposits. During the quarter, the company witnessed a rise in new bookings and fewer FCC redemptions. Given the full fleet resumption and load factors (at approximately 95%), the company expects customer deposits to return to typical seasonality in the upcoming periods.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoyal Caribbean continues using digital tools for marketing, product development and enhancing the consumer experience. These include revamped websites, new vacation packaging capabilities, support for mobile apps and increased bandwidth onboard to help its guests remain well-connected while at sea. With busier customers preferring more digital devices that help to save time, the introduction of superior Internet bandwidth and online check-in accompanied by radio-frequency identification technology should continue to increase occupancy. Royal Caribbean introduces new technological capabilities under its Project Excalibur. The company rolled out a smartphone app to increase convenience and better serve guests. The company focuses on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to boost its offering as well as deliver superior yields and margins.On the supply front, the company is steadfast in increasing its capacity to meet rising demand. Moving into 2023, the company has three ships scheduled for delivery namely — Icon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova. The company stated that Icon will have eight distinct neighborhoods and that its stateroom configuration will allow for load factors to be accretive to the overall portfolio. Also, it reported a solid market response in terms of bookings for the ship. The company anticipates the ship to be significantly accretive to its key financial metrics.During the third quarter of 2022, the company unveiled a three-year financial performance initiative - Trifecta Program, thereby articulating longer-term financial objectives. The program emphasizes financial coordinates, including Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC, with an intent to achieve it by 2025-end. Under this program, the company expects to achieve a triple-digit adjusted EBITDA per APCD, exceeding the earlier record adjusted EBITDA per APCD of $87 in 2019. The company also expects to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings per share, exceeding the earlier adjusted earnings per share of $9.54 in 2019. Lastly, the company anticipates achieving a return on invested capital in the teens by the end of 2025. The company intends to achieve the metrics on account of its underlying strategies, robust secular and demographic trends, moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth and strong cost discipline.Story continuesConcernsThe leisure industry is currently grappling with the coronavirus crisis and Royal Caribbean isn’t immune to the trend. China, which is closed to international travelers, will continue to hurt cruise operators. Also, it stated that the impacts of COVID-19 (on the shipyards), Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and other macroeconomic events, have resulted in some delays in expected ship deliveries.Royal Caribbean has been bearing the brunt of high expenses for quite some time. During the third quarter of 2022, total cruise operating expenses increased 140.4% year over year to $1,956.3 million. The company’s expenses in the quarter primarily stemmed from the resumption of cruise voyages. This and inflationary increases related to fuel and food costs added to the downside. For the fourth quarter of 2022, the company expects net cruise costs (excluding fuel per APCD) to increase by low to mid-single digits compared with 2019. This includes expected transitory costs related to health protocols and one-time lagging costs related to the fleet ramp-up. The company anticipates inflationary and supply chain challenges (mainly related to fuel and food costs) to persist for some time.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksRoyal Caribbean has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), at present.

241,bdd0f424-f2db-341a-a7d6-70a66be7b82c,ROST,2022-12-13,E-Commerce Powering Retail Rebound: 5 Solid Stocks to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/e-commerce-powering-retail-rebound-130501113.html,1670850301,STORY,"['URBN', 'VRA', 'ROST', 'ULTA']","[E-commerce is growing faster than it was expected, thanks to the pandemic that changed the shopping habits of millions. Although e-commerce was growing at a fast pace, people finally realized the convenience and security associated with this mode only after they were compelled to shop online on fears of contracting COVID-19.This also has been helping the retail sector as the majority of the sales are now happening online. Given this scenario, stocks with a strong online presence like Vera Bradley, Inc. VRA, Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST and Five Below, Inc. FIVE are expected to benefit in the near term.E-Commerce Continues to GrowAccording to the Department of Commerce, e-commerce sales in the United States broke the $1 trillion threshold for the first time and totaled $1.02 trillion in the past 12 months in November. This comes despite soaring commodity prices that have been hampering sales for months now.Even then, online sales are projected to grow 9% in 2022. E-commerce has been playing a major role in driving overall retail sales amid struggles this year. Online sales were particularly on the rise in the third quarter.According to the Census Bureau, retail sales totaled $1,792 billion in the third quarter, up 0.7% over the second quarter. Online sales rose 10.8% year over year and 3% month over month to reach $265.9 billion.Moreover, e-commerce accounted for 14.8% of overall retail sales in the third quarter.This comes as Adobe Analytics reported that Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales hit record highs this year, marking a great start to the holiday season. According to the report, Cyber Monday sales increased 5.8% year over year, totaling $11.3 billion. Cyber Monday sales were $10.7 billion in 2021 and $10.8 billion in 2020, respectively. The sales figures for this year set a new record after declining 1.4% in 2021.Online purchases on Black Friday surpassed $9.12 billion, also setting a record. Overall e-commerce sales on Black Friday were up 2.3% from the prior year. In 2020, Black Friday sales came in at $9.03 billion.Story continuesE-commerce growth has been enormous over the past two years. Although the pandemic gave it a boost, the trend has since continued. In fact, it was earlier predicted that e-commerce spending would reach $1 trillion in 2024, but the goal has already been met this year, demonstrating the enormous potential.Clearly, the market has doubled in size in just three years. Spending on online purchases has increased by 25% from the pre-pandemic levels. Had the pandemic not struck and the market continued to expand at its long-term growth rate of 14% to 15%, total online sales would have been around $815 billion, down about $200 billion.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it would be wise to invest in these four stocks with a strong online presence. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Vera Bradley, Inc. is a designer, producer, marketer and retailer of accessories for women.

(NASDAQ:ADI) institutional owners may be pleased with recent gains after 0.4% loss over the past year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110127892.html,1670929287,STORY,['ADI'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$2.9b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 0.4% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Analog Devices. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Analog Devices?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Analog Devices does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Analog Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Analog Devices is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.0%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Analog DevicesWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Analog Devices, Inc.. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$298m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 10% stake in Analog Devices. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

FLT.Industry: Financial ServicesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2027768/5-financial-transaction-stocks-in-focus-despite-industry-woesThe Financial Transaction Services industry is likely to benefit from the growing adoption of digital means – a trend that is unlikely to slow down. Though improved consumer spending and rebounding travel remain underway, the optimistic scenario might be strained by the continued impact of inflation.Elevated technology investments in order to sustain one’s market position remain a significant challenge for financial transaction services providers. Despite such headwinds, companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. are placed well to counter the industry headwinds.About the IndustryThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are effectuated through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.4 Trends Influencing the Financial Transaction Services Industry's FutureSevere Competition Compelling Heavy Technology Investments: The Financial Transaction Services space witnesses intensifying competition as a result of which industry players are compelled to undertake significant technology investments. The ongoing trend to go digital has triggered the need to opt for investments in order to upgrade one’s digital capabilities. But rolling out advanced digital payment solutions is not adequate, as increased digitization often gives rise to sophisticated forms of cybercrimes.Story continuesTherefore, the industry players also need to undertake investments for equipping themselves with enhanced fraud detection solutions. An elevated expense level might hamper margins of the industry players.M&amp;A Strategy Under Pressure: Players of the Financial Transaction Services space frequently resort to a merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy for bolstering capabilities, bringing diversification benefits, expanding global presence and increasing the customer base. However, per S&amp;P Global, M&amp;A activity has been on a downtrend this year and shows no signs of a sharp turnaround in the near term.The Fed’s frequent rate hikes in order to counter inflationary headwinds stir volatility in equity markets. As a result, the purchasing power of consumers suffered a blow. Additionally, rising interest rates increase the cost of financing, which makes businesses reluctant to pursue M&amp;A deals.Better Consumer Spending &amp; Rebounding Travel: Consumer spending seems not to have been much affected by the ongoing inflationary pressure, per the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ first estimate of third-quarter 2022 Gross Domestic Product. This brings a ray of hope for financial transaction services stocks since the transaction volumes of these players depend, to a large extent, on consumer spending.Even amid the ongoing pressure of inflation, substantial personal savings made during the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a cushion, facilitating continued consumer spending. With border restrictions lifted and the pandemic becoming the new normal of life, individuals have resumed traveling. However, the future of consumer spending looks uncertain owing to the unpredictable nature of inflation and looming recession fears.Growing Adoption of Contactless Payment Methods: The pandemic-induced shift toward contactless payments proved to be a boon for not only consumers but for financial transaction services players as well. With cash and checks taking a backseat, several flexible digital payment options such as cryptocurrency, biometrics, QR code and buy now, pay later (BNPL) option came to the forefront. While affordability and ease of digital payments were benefits to consumers, the industry players were aided by steady and diversified revenue streams.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Drab ProspectsThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects.

If you want to see more of the top sectors to consider, check out 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023. With a recession on the horizon, many investors are cautious when it comes to putting their money in the equity market. However, although the S&amp;P 500 is in bear territory, there are some sectors which are performing better than the others. In 2022, safe haven assets and defensive market sectors like utilities, healthcare, consumer staples, and gold have outperformed relative to the overall US market. The energy sector has also gained close to 50% year-to-date due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although defensive sectors are considered to be more lucrative investments heading into a recessionary environment, if the central bank manages to slow down interest rate hikes after achieving about 5.0% to 5.5%, then technology and high growth stocks can potentially recover. If that is the case, technology and semiconductor sectors are some of the ETFs that may outperform based on the sector rotation model.Investing in exchange traded funds allows investors affordable access to legacy large-cap firms like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). Our MethodologyWe tallied the sectors of the 100 most popular stocks among hedge funds and present the 11 most frequently invested sectors by the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022. 11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023Photo by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 202311. Telecommunications EquipmentIn 2022, the telecom industry faced new opportunities and challenges alike, driven by a dynamic regulatory, technological, and competitive backdrop. The $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized in November allots $65 billion for ongoing broadband adoption and deployment. The global telecom equipment market was worth $538.9 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to reach $967.9 billion by 2030, indicating a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period of 2022 to 2030. Story continuesOne of the best telecommunications equipment stocks to invest in according to elite hedge funds is T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), a Washington-based company that provides mobile communications services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company also offers wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, and other mobile communication devices. For full-year 2022, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)’s postpaid net customer additions are expected to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, an increase from the prior guidance of 6.0 million to 6.3 million.Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on November 15 raised the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $202 from $195 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares. The company's growing ability to leverage its ""massive ""5G high-speed network will continue to drive increasing customer gains and revenue growth”, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst said T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)’s leadership position in 5G continues to support ""industry-leading postpaid service revenue and cash flow growth.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 100 hedge funds were long T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with a stake worth $703.3 million. Like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the stocks favored by elite hedge funds. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”10. Internet and Information ServicesInternet and Information Services is one of the best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. The global IT services market grew from $3,471.35 billion in 2021 to $3,938.75 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. The market is forecasted to reach $5,905.09 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 10.7%. Financial services, retail and wholesale, manufacturing, and healthcare are some end-user markets for the Internet and Information Services industry.One of the best information services stocks to invest in according to smart investors includes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. It operates in six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. Year-to-date as of October 27, the company has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program and expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the ASR in December 2022. On December 2, BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber raised the price target on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) to $400 from $393 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst lifted his FY23 EPS view to $12.00 to $11.66 after its Investor Day presentation and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)’s numerous growth drivers, including higher use of technology, demand for risk solutions, and sustainability.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was part of 90 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 84 in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 8.7 million shares worth $2.6 billion. Baron Funds made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”9. Catalog/Specialty Distribution Catalog/Specialty Distribution is one of the top sectors to look out for in 2023. One of the premier stocks in the industry is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a technology conglomerate that engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. The company operates through three segments – North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. On November 30, Amazon Web Services announced that it will likely keep hiring in 2023 and construct new data centers despite a hiring freeze at the rest of the company.On December 1, Cowen analyst John Blackledge raised the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $160 from $150 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he expects lower operating losses excluding AWS and Advertising in 2023 as cost headwinds normalize.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 269 funds reported owning stakes worth $34.6 billion in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 252 funds in the prior quarter worth $30 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest stake in the company, with approximately 50 million shares worth $5.6 billion. L1 Capital International made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Quarterly results (mostly reported in late July and early August) were generally in line with our expectations. Solid company execution was subsequently swamped by increases in interest rates and hawkish Federal Reserve commentary. During the quarter, only one company (Amazon.com) made a positive contribution of more than 0.5% in Australian dollars. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the largest negative contributor in the June 2022 quarter, with the share price recovering modestly but it is still well below our view of fair value. No company detracted more than 0.5% from the Fund’s performance in Australian dollars, although the depreciation of the Australian dollar obfuscates some meaningful share price falls in U.S. dollarsWe did not participate in the ‘unprofitable tech bubble’, but our portfolio does have significant exposure to some of the largest, highly profitable and incredibly financially strong technology companies which dominate their markets and have outstanding medium to long term growth prospects – including Alphabet, Amazon, Intuit and Microsoft. The share price of these companies has now fallen to levels we now consider to provide very attractive valuations for long term investors.”8. Oil &amp; Gas Production The Oil &amp; Gas Production industry reported all-time high profits in 2022, offering sufficient cash flow to finance their operations in 2023. While oil and gas companies understand the geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop they will be faced with in the year ahead, they understand that the transition to cleaner energy in the long term is inevitable. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise in 2023 but at a slower pace than 2022. OPEC forecasts demand to increase by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or 2.7%, in 2023.According to smart investors, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading oil and gas stocks to consider for a balanced portfolio. Q3 2022 was the most lucrative quarter for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as net income came in at $19.66 billion, revenues surged 52% year-over-year to $112.07 billion, and the company raised its quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $0.91 per share.On November 22, Citi analyst Alastair Syme raised the price target on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $110 from $98 and reaffirmed a Neutral rating on the shares. The market rotation into energy equities has ""further to run, even though names in our US coverage already sit at all-time highs,"" the analyst told investors. History suggests that energy firms usually perform well in an earnings recession, which is Citi's base-case for 2023, wrote the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 72 funds in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 33.8 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7. Major BanksAs the global economy remains fragile heading into 2023, with high risk of stagflation or a mild recession, the effects will be felt across the banking industry as well. However, large, well-capitalized, and diversified banks should survive the market volatility relatively well. One of such banks is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), which operates worldwide through Consumer &amp; Community Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset &amp; Wealth Management segments. On November 30, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it is seeking to expand its retirement products in China, the world's second largest economy, as China officially launched its private pension system last week. Citi analyst Keith Horowitz on October 17 reiterated a Buy rating on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a $135 price target following the company's Q3 results. The analyst said the bank is ""hitting on all cylinders"" and that present share levels offer an ""excellent entry point"" for a ""quality franchise.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 104 in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent stake in the company, comprising 7.5 million shares worth $788 million. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”6. Business ServicesThe global business support services market grew from $561.32 billion in 2021 to $621.03 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 10.6%. The business support services market is expected to reach $835.66 billion in 2026, indicating a CAGR of 7.7%. Business-to-business, social, and business-to-consumer are the three main categories of business services. It is one of the best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), an American financial technology company offering transaction processing, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, is one of the best business services stocks to monitor. On November 25, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported that its U.S. payments volume in November increased 9% from a year ago, even after the company suspended its operations in Russia in March 2022, and the volume was up 10% in October 2022. On December 2, Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti raised the price target on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to $250 from $225 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is becoming even more involved in the global money movement ecosystem with its new products, making it harder to disintermediate them in any significant way, the analyst told investors. He thinks Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) can still deliver 20% EPS growth for the foreseeable future.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 165 hedge funds were bullish on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 166 funds in the last quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1 billion.In addition to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), smart investors are piling into Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) heading into 2023. Baron Funds made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global payment network Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) fell despite reporting financial results that beat Street forecasts and sustained volume growth in recent months. Revenue grew 19% and EPS grew 33% in the most recent quarter, and double-digit payment volume growth persisted through August. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and may be due to foreign exchange headwinds and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending. We continue to own the stock due to Visa’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:Most Advanced Countries in Artificial Intelligence10 Youngest Hedge Fund Billionaires10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

While the consumer price index (CPI), which is due at 08:30 ET (13:30 GMT), is expected to show that inflation eased further in November, markets are wary of any unexpected strength in the reading.The U.S. producer price index, which gauges manufacturing inflation, eased less than expected in November, raising fears of a similar trend in the CPI.Spot gold was flat at $1,782.17 an ounce, while gold futures steadied around $1,793.10 an ounce. Both instruments sank over 1% on Monday.A stronger-than-expected inflation reading is likely to elicit a hawkish response from the Federal Reserve - a move that could push up the dollar and Treasury yields while heralding more pressure on metal markets. The greenback steadied above a five-month low on Tuesday.While the central bank is set to hike interest rates by 50 basis points at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday, its guidance on where interest rates will peak will be closely watched. The Fed hiked rates by a total 375 bps this year, which weighed heavily on gold by driving up the opportunity cost of holding the yellow metal.While the central bank signaled it will raise interest rates at a slower pace in the coming months, it also warned that interest rates could peak at much higher levels if inflation shows little signs of easing.Other precious metals were mildly positive on Tuesday after logging sharp losses in the prior sessions. Platinum futures rose 0.1%, while silver futures added 0.5%.Among industrial metals, copper prices edged higher after falling sharply in the prior session.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $3.8137 a pound, recovering from a 1% drop.The red metal is expected to see volatile trade in the coming weeks amid uncertainty over how major importer China will carry out an economic reopening from nearly three years of COVID lockdowns.While the country relaxed several movement and quarantine measures, it is still coping with its worst ever outbreak.Related ArticlesGold nurses sharp losses as U.S. CPI report, Fed meeting loomAs Russia pounds Ukraine civil infrastructure, powers meet to provide aidU.S. sends first shipment of power gear to aid Ukraine]"

Demonstrators have taken to the streets to demand that Peru hold new elections, with some also calling for Congress to be shuttered and Castillo released.The head of the Peru ombudsman's office, Eliana Revollar, said seven people had died during two days of protests, all from gunshot wounds.Authorities in Apurimac had earlier Monday reported the death of a 16-year-old and two 18-year-olds, while another death was reported in Arequipa and two teenagers were killed on Sunday.""These are really are needless deaths,"" Revollar told local broadcaster Epicentro, adding that at least 32 civilians and 24 police had been injured.Citing ""difficult times,"" Peru's sixth president in the past five years said she was proposing to move up the next general election to April 2024. It was previously scheduled for 2026.In a handwritten letter posted to his Twitter page on Monday, Castillo called Boluarte's early election pledge a ""dirty game"" and derided her as a ""usurper,"" calling for an immediate assembly to rewrite the nation's constitution.Castillo also said he would not resign as president despite his lawful removal from power. He is being held in a penitentiary center in Lima while he is being investigated by prosecutors for the alleged crimes of rebellion and conspiracy.The leftist governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico and Colombia issued a joint statement on Monday calling for the protection of Castillo's human and judicial rights, adding that the ""agents"" of Castillo's removal should prioritize ""the will of the citizens that was declared at the polls.""Story continuesCastillo was elected by a narrow margin last year with Boluarte as his running mate.Some civil and indigenous groups in the world's No. 2 copper producer also announced a strike starting on Monday in Apurimac, home to significant mining projects including Las Bambas, a major copper mine owned by China's MMG Ltd.A source at Las Bambas, which has battled blockades for years, told Reuters it has received more blockade threats amid a ""radicalization"" of protests against the firm by locals.'HIGH CONFLICT'A former teacher and peasant farmer, Castillo attracted strong support last year from rural and mining areas. But during the first year of his administration, corruption allegations against him mounted while he presided over unprecedented turnover among senior ministers.Protests involving hundreds or thousands of people have been held since last week in cities in Peru's interior and capital Lima, at times turning violent.The U.N. Human Rights Office warned of further escalation in a statement on Monday, calling on authorities to exercise restraint and fully investigate the deaths of protesters.In Apurimac, authorities ordered the airport's closure after an attack by protesters, and parts of Peru's main coastal highway was blocked on Monday in Ica and Arequipa.LATAM Airlines said it had canceled flights to and from the city of Arequipa after reports protesters invaded a runway.""Dina Boluarte doesn't represent us. She's a traitor. She's incompetent,"" said Juan Calle at a march in Lima, calling on the new president to be jailed and Castillo released.Boluarte, 60, declared a state of emergency in areas of ""high conflict,"" allowing soldiers to take more control.""I have given the instructions so that control of internal order can be recovered peacefully, without affecting the people's fundamental rights,"" said Boluarte, who lamented the deaths.(Reporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Anthony Esposito and Sarah Morland; Editing by Alistair Bell and Rosalba O'Brien)]"

The presentation is available on the investor relations section of the Company’s website.Dear Fellow Stockholder,Aimco’s Annual Meeting is just days away. We urge you to act TODAY. Protect the value of your investment by voting ""FOR"" Aimco’s three highly qualified, independent director nominees – Jay Leupp, Michael Stein and Dary Stone– on the Universal WHITE Proxy Card.The New Aimco Board is successfully executing a clearly defined strategy, as exemplified by Aimco’s outstanding total stockholder returns since the spin-off of Apartment Income REIT Corp. (""AIR"") in December 2020. The New Aimco Board has made tremendous progress and will continue to act as a change agent for the benefit of all Aimco stockholders.As you consider your vote, we ask you to consider the following:1. The New Aimco Board is independent and has been purpose-built to include directors with specific skills and expertise.The Board has appointed six new independent directors since the spin-off of AIR in December 2020. Of the Board’s five committees, four are chaired by new, independent directors with no ties to pre-spin Aimco.Jay Leupp brings important stockholder perspectives gained through real estate and REIT experience spanning investment, sell-side research and board positions. As Audit Committee Chair, he works closely with Aimco’s finance team and is leveraging his expertise to help oversee the ongoing enhancement of Aimco’s investor relations program.Michael Stein brings deep institutional knowledge of Aimco and significant experience executing strategic transactions to maximize stockholder value. His skills, experience and leadership as Chairman of Aimco’s Investment Committee are critical to Aimco’s value maximization efforts, particularly in light of the Company’s ongoing review.Dary Stone’s leadership as the Chair of the Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committee was instrumental in Aimco’s recent governance enhancement efforts. He brings expertise in corporate governance and significant experience gained leading several real estate development companies.Story continues2.

Since the spin-off through the unaffected date, AIV has outperformed the company's peer median by 49.9 percentage points, the dissident's peer median by 52.4 percentage points, and the FTSE NAREIT Apartment Index by 32.0 percentage points.""Aimco has eliminated the relative valuation gap versus its peer group on an estimated NAV basis – moving from a 20% relative discount to peers in 2021 to an approximately 2% premium relative to peers as of October 2022.The Board is not content with performance that is only ‘in-line’ with peers and is actively considering all opportunities available to Aimco to further enhance and unlock stockholder value and will leave no stone unturned.3. We have enhanced Aimco’s corporate governance profile and embraced emerging best practices.Aimco is accelerating the declassification of the Board to be effective at the 2023 annual meeting, when all directors will be elected to annual terms.Aimco has committed to opt out of the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act, or MUTA, prior to the 2023 annual meeting.Aimco is transitioning the timing of the Company’s annual meeting date so the 2023 annual meeting will be held by the end of the third quarter of 2023 and the 2024 annual meeting will be held by the end of the second quarter of 2024.Aimco is asking stockholders to approve amendments to the Company’s charter at the 2023 annual meeting to eliminate super-majority requirements to amend the Bylaws and remove directors, allow directors to be removed by stockholders without cause, and expand stockholder rights to replace directors.Effective as of the 2023 annual meeting, Aimco is amending the Company’s Bylaws to lower the threshold for stockholders to call a special meeting to a simple majority of shares outstanding.4. We have a proven track record of active stockholder engagement and have steadily enhanced our Investor Relations efforts.The New Aimco Board and management team have met with stockholders representing more than 80% of Aimco’s outstanding shares of common stock over the past 13 months.The New Aimco Board and management team took seriously the outreach from Jonathan Litt of Land &amp; Buildings following his September 2022 letter to the Board, quickly engaging with Mr. Litt to hear his views directly.Within fewer than 90 days of Mr. Litt’s writing, and in response to a broad survey of stockholders, Aimco committed to implementing significant governance enhancements.In 2021, Aimco launched an all-new website and produced a webcast and 73-page strategic overview presentation.Aimco attends major industry conferences, including BTIG and NAREIT in 2022, and is committed to ongoing engagement with investors.Aimco has reached out to no less than a dozen sell-side equity research analysis and are in continuous discussions.Aimco has provided in-depth quarterly disclosures on development and redevelopment projects and components necessary to calculate NAV.5. Land &amp; Buildings’ nominees are not additive to the Aimco Board and there is no case for changeWe acknowledge that James Sullivan is an experienced real estate analyst, but he has no public company board or executive management experience and does not provide any expertise that is not currently represented on the New Aimco Board.The election of either James Sullivan or Michelle Applebaum would displace a current Aimco Board Committee Chair with significant public REIT board and corporate real estate experience as well as extensive experience overseeing value-enhancing M&amp;A transactions.The removal of Michael Stein from the Board is unwarranted, given New Aimco’s strong results, and would impair Aimco’s ongoing strategic review.Leading proxy advisor firm Glass Lewis stated in its December 1st report1: ""…we do not believe board change is warranted at this time.""6. Settlement discussions with Land &amp; Buildings have not been constructive - its demands have been unreasonable and not in stockholders’ best interestAimco recently held discussions with Land &amp; Buildings and offered to appoint Mr. Sullivan to the Aimco Board. Under Aimco’s proposal, Mr. Sullivan was invited to serve on the Investment Committee as well as the Audit, Compensation and Human Resources, and Nominating, Environmental, Social, and Governance Committees. Aimco also offered to appoint the highly qualified Pat Gibson as Chair of the Investment Committee. Ms. Gibson is an experienced real estate investor and a new independent director on the Aimco Board (who Mr. Litt has approved of previously). Mr. Litt rejected the proposal.Land &amp; Buildings has unreasonably refused to entertain any settlement proposal that does not result in the removal of Michael Stein, a vital member of the Aimco Board given his experience overseeing strategic corporate transactions and unlocking stockholder value.Land &amp; Buildings demanded that Mr. Sullivan be appointed Chairman of the Board’s Investment committee and that four of Aimco’s other independent directors resign from the Committee.While we recognize Mr. Sullivan’s experience as a research analyst, the Board does not believe he has the experience to chair a committee of a public company Board of Directors given his lack of previous public board experience, corporate capital allocation and investment, real estate management and / or development experience, and his non-existent track record of value creation at a public company._______________1 Permission to use quotes neither sought nor obtainedIt is extremely important that Aimco stockholders vote as soon as possible.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Growth ETFs in 2022.Growth stocks have been punished in 2022. The Fed's aggressive rate hikes throughout the year panicked investors who abandoned ship and caused major sell offs in tech. The higher borrowing costs put a strain on tech companies' future cash flows, making investors skeptical about growth companies' ability to grow in such an environment. As of December 8, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has lost roughly about a third of its value year to date, and going into 2023, investors are still being cautious around allocating capital to growth.While growth stocks are a risky area to put your money in right now, for investors that are looking to gain exposure to growth but avoid the rampant volatility and high risk they come with, growth ETFs can be the answer. Growth ETFs are a type of exchange-traded fund that invests in growth stocks. Investors looking for higher returns and greater diversification than a traditional stock portfolio may choose to invest in growth ETFs.Investing in growth ETFs can bring many benefits over investing in individual growth stocks. ETFs offer diversification and liquidity, allowing investors to access multiple stocks from a single purchase, without having to purchase each stock separately. ETFs also provide a lower cost of entry compared to buying individual stocks, since the fees associated with ETFs are typically much lower than the fees associated with buying individual stocks. Finally, ETFs offer more stability than individual stocks, as they are less volatile and less prone to sudden price movements. This stability can help investors mitigate risk, particularly during times of market volatility. Furthermore, ETFs are easier to track and manage, as they are typically linked to an index, such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq, which makes it easier to gauge performance.Story continuesThis article will look at some of the best performing growth ETFs in 2022 through which investors can gain exposure to leading growth companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), without being vulnerable to huge price swings.Biotech and Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy According to Palo Alto InvestorsSource:unsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the 10 best performing growth ETFs in 2022, we screened for non-leveraged and non-inverse technology ETFs. We sorted them according to their year-to-date returns, as of December 8, and then ranked them in increasing order of their YTD returns. Along with each ETF, we have mentioned its YTD return, the index it tracks, its portfolio breakdown, and notable holdings.Best Performing Growth ETFs in 202210. Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR)YTD Return as of December 8: -22.03%The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) is an exchange traded fund that uses a full replication technique to track the performance of the Indxx Global Internet of Things Thematic Index. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.68% and yields 0.59% to investors. As of December 8, the Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) has lost 22.03% year to date, outperforming the Nasdaq by roughly 8%, and is ranked among the 10 best performing growth ETFs in 2022.The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) invests in companies that belong to the IoT industry. These companies include wearable technology, home automation, connected automotive technology, and sensors companies among others. The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) has 63 holdings and a top ten holdings concentration of 47.25%.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) is among the most prominent holdings of The Global X Internet of Things ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR). As of September 30, Millennium Management is the top investor in Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) and has a position worth $142.4 million.On November 30, KGI Securities analyst Derek Chang upgraded Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) to Outperform from Neutral and reiterated his $130 price target on the shares.Here is what Heartland Advisors had to say about Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Before the risk-on rebound early in the quarter, we were searching for opportunities to shift from our defensive stance, looking for beaten-down, high-quality “early cycle” leaders. Existing holding, Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), represents one such opportunity that was added to on weakness.Skyworks is one of two leading providers of radio frequency system components to smartphone makers and electronics manufacturers. With every step-up in product complexity, over the past two decades, the competitive landscape has shrunk while gross margins have increased significantly. 5G represents another such step-up, which is likely to increase how much Skyworks can make per smartphone.Apple is a big customer, accounting for more than half of Skyworks’ sales. That customer concentration has depressed Skyworks’ valuation over time. More recently, fears surrounding a global recession and risk to consumer demand have further pressured valuation. However, the handset business is expected to benefit from 5G content, which may help offset some macroeconomic pressures. Away from the handset business, Skyworks’ growth is expected to accelerate thanks to other secular drivers such as WIFI 6 and growth of the industrial internet (i.e., “Internet of Things”).At a P/E of less than eight and a 2.3% dividend yield, SWKS rarely gets this cheap, making this high-quality stock compelling for longterm investors.”9.

The company has significantly underperformed the index and semiconductor peers recently due to a gaming inventory correction, a decline in aggregate cryptocurrency demand and reduction in crypto mining intensity as well as concerns around the sustainability of data center sales.We tactically trimmed our position early in 2022 due to concerns around these cycle dynamics but remain confident in the company’s long-term prospects.”Some of the best-in-class names in tech include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).6.

Although 2023 will bring a slight dampening of automation growth due to macro headwinds and slow economic growth, companies who are stable and resilient will adapt to the new normal but also strengthen their automation efforts to gain competitive advantage. Automation is changing multiple industries in addition to industrial and manufacturing. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the American retail giant, expects investments in automation to be one of the core factors supporting its future profitability, as per Doug McMillon, Walmart President and CEO. He noted that robotic warehouses where inventory is moved by automated wheeled carts will reduce the need for labor in the warehouses themselves, and also in the stores where the goods are transferred. This will drive costs significantly lower over the long-term. Some of the best automation stocks to consider include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON), and Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT). Our Methodology We selected the following automation stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility.

(NYSE:PATH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Over the last three months, we similarly exited UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) due to a change to our original thesis as we believe a new go-to-market strategy for its automation software could impact near-term execution. While we think process automation is a growing market, in a slowing macro environment single solutions may be more vulnerable than the platform solutions of software providers who can bundle products to meet a wide range of needs. In addition, the company has a material component of sales sourced in Europe where the economy is more vulnerable.”9. Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33Teradyne, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TER) at the end of September 2022, compared to 30 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:ROK) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), a Milwaukee-based industrial automation company, struggled early in the year with component shortages that prevented it from clearing its overflowing order books and rising input costs. Uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the war in Ukraine prompted management to warn in May of lower profits for the rest of the year. Behind the frustrations, however, were indications that the business outlook remained strong, as order volume continued to grow following price increases at the end of 2021. In the recent quarter, the company reported stronger results despite ongoing supply chain issues that hindered its ability to fulfill orders. To mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, Rockwell has been accumulating inventory and redesigning certain products. We believe Rockwell will see its revenues expand as its resilience improves and supply shortages recede.”7. PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39PTC Inc.

(NYSE:AYX) is a California-based company that operates in the analytic process automation business in the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and internationally. The company's analytics platform allows organizations to advance business outcomes and the productivity of their business analysts, data scientists, citizen data scientists, and data engineers. After posting market-beating Q3 results, Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) expects Q4 revenue to be in the range of $276 million to $281 million, representing year-over-year growth of 59% to 62%.On November 2, Needham analyst Mike Cikos maintained a Buy rating on Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX) but lowered the price target on the shares to $62 from $80. The company's Q3 results were ""strong"" and the management's preliminary discussion for 2023 growth levers is the number one takeaway from its earnings call, noted the analyst. However, his reduced price target is a reflection of wider market movements and multiple compression, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 40 hedge funds were long Alteryx, Inc. (NYSE:AYX), compared to 33 funds in the prior quarter. Brian Bares’ Bares Capital Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with approximately 3 million shares worth $163.8 million. Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Honeywell International Inc.

(NYSE:AYX) in its Q3 2020 investor letter:“Alteryx provides comprehensive self-service data-analytics software to data scientists and business analysts for finding and sharing data, preparing and blending it, performing a variety of analysis, sharing insights, and automation, without the need for coding. Alteryx’s software is unique in combining a comprehensive data analytics platform with ease of use, driving dramatic improvements in business productivity and outcomes. We believe Alteryx has a large market opportunity given its ability to help data scientists as well as business analysts who have limited technical capabilities. Alteryx serves a broad base of customers across all verticals and all sizes.During the second quarter, Alteryx reported slower revenue growth relative to prior periods, and guided down full-year revenue below expectations. The revenue slowdown was partly driven by customers in certain areas that were heavily impacted by COVID-19, like small businesses and companies in the hospitality vertical, that slowed spending on new purchases and expansions. Additionally, the company noted that some customers are taking longer to make purchase decisions, extending sales cycles. These developments led to the underperformance during the third quarter. We believe the revenue slowdown is a short-term phenomenon, and continue to believe Alteryx has a large market opportunity and a long runway for multi-year growth.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Automation Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:10 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 202210 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Automation Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

If you want to see more of the top sectors to consider, check out 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023. With a recession on the horizon, many investors are cautious when it comes to putting their money in the equity market. However, although the S&amp;P 500 is in bear territory, there are some sectors which are performing better than the others. In 2022, safe haven assets and defensive market sectors like utilities, healthcare, consumer staples, and gold have outperformed relative to the overall US market. The energy sector has also gained close to 50% year-to-date due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Although defensive sectors are considered to be more lucrative investments heading into a recessionary environment, if the central bank manages to slow down interest rate hikes after achieving about 5.0% to 5.5%, then technology and high growth stocks can potentially recover. If that is the case, technology and semiconductor sectors are some of the ETFs that may outperform based on the sector rotation model.Investing in exchange traded funds allows investors affordable access to legacy large-cap firms like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW). Our MethodologyWe tallied the sectors of the 100 most popular stocks among hedge funds and present the 11 most frequently invested sectors by the 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the third quarter of 2022. 11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023Photo by Mirza Babic on UnsplashBest Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 202311. Telecommunications EquipmentIn 2022, the telecom industry faced new opportunities and challenges alike, driven by a dynamic regulatory, technological, and competitive backdrop. The $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) authorized in November allots $65 billion for ongoing broadband adoption and deployment. The global telecom equipment market was worth $538.9 billion in 2021 and is forecasted to reach $967.9 billion by 2030, indicating a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period of 2022 to 2030. Story continuesOne of the best telecommunications equipment stocks to invest in according to elite hedge funds is T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), a Washington-based company that provides mobile communications services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The company also offers wireless devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, and other mobile communication devices. For full-year 2022, T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)’s postpaid net customer additions are expected to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, an increase from the prior guidance of 6.0 million to 6.3 million.Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth on November 15 raised the price target on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) to $202 from $195 and reiterated a Buy rating on the shares. The company's growing ability to leverage its ""massive ""5G high-speed network will continue to drive increasing customer gains and revenue growth”, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst said T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)’s leadership position in 5G continues to support ""industry-leading postpaid service revenue and cash flow growth.""According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 100 hedge funds were long T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with a stake worth $703.3 million. Like AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is one of the stocks favored by elite hedge funds. In its Q4 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments shared its stance on T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”10. Internet and Information ServicesInternet and Information Services is one of the best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. The global IT services market grew from $3,471.35 billion in 2021 to $3,938.75 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 13.5%. The market is forecasted to reach $5,905.09 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 10.7%. Financial services, retail and wholesale, manufacturing, and healthcare are some end-user markets for the Internet and Information Services industry.One of the best information services stocks to invest in according to smart investors includes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity, and automotive markets. It operates in six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. Year-to-date as of October 27, the company has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program and expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the ASR in December 2022. On December 2, BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber raised the price target on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) to $400 from $393 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst lifted his FY23 EPS view to $12.00 to $11.66 after its Investor Day presentation and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)’s numerous growth drivers, including higher use of technology, demand for risk solutions, and sustainability.According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) was part of 90 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 84 in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 8.7 million shares worth $2.6 billion. Baron Funds made the following comment about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of rating agency and data provider S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) fell 9% during the third quarter due to continued weak debt issuance activity and headwinds to the Indices business from equity market declines. Credit markets were exceptionally soft during the quarter with non-financial corporate bond issuance down 36% for investment grade and down 84% for high yield, reflecting greater investor risk aversion, rising interest rates, and a drop-off in M&amp;A activity. We believe this ratings weakness is temporary and diversification benefits from the acquisition of IHS Markit should support earnings growth next year. Over the long term, the company should continue benefiting from the secular trends of increasing bond issuance, growth in passive investing, and demand for data and analytics, while enjoying meaningful and durable competitive advantages that, in our view, are only strengthening following the merger with IHS Markit.”9. Catalog/Specialty Distribution Catalog/Specialty Distribution is one of the top sectors to look out for in 2023. One of the premier stocks in the industry is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), a technology conglomerate that engages in the retail sale of consumer products and subscriptions in North America and internationally. The company operates through three segments – North America, International, and Amazon Web Services. On November 30, Amazon Web Services announced that it will likely keep hiring in 2023 and construct new data centers despite a hiring freeze at the rest of the company.On December 1, Cowen analyst John Blackledge raised the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to $160 from $150 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said he expects lower operating losses excluding AWS and Advertising in 2023 as cost headwinds normalize.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 269 funds reported owning stakes worth $34.6 billion in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 252 funds in the prior quarter worth $30 billion. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management held the largest stake in the company, with approximately 50 million shares worth $5.6 billion. L1 Capital International made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Quarterly results (mostly reported in late July and early August) were generally in line with our expectations. Solid company execution was subsequently swamped by increases in interest rates and hawkish Federal Reserve commentary. During the quarter, only one company (Amazon.com) made a positive contribution of more than 0.5% in Australian dollars. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was the largest negative contributor in the June 2022 quarter, with the share price recovering modestly but it is still well below our view of fair value. No company detracted more than 0.5% from the Fund’s performance in Australian dollars, although the depreciation of the Australian dollar obfuscates some meaningful share price falls in U.S. dollarsWe did not participate in the ‘unprofitable tech bubble’, but our portfolio does have significant exposure to some of the largest, highly profitable and incredibly financially strong technology companies which dominate their markets and have outstanding medium to long term growth prospects – including Alphabet, Amazon, Intuit and Microsoft. The share price of these companies has now fallen to levels we now consider to provide very attractive valuations for long term investors.”8. Oil &amp; Gas Production The Oil &amp; Gas Production industry reported all-time high profits in 2022, offering sufficient cash flow to finance their operations in 2023. While oil and gas companies understand the geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop they will be faced with in the year ahead, they understand that the transition to cleaner energy in the long term is inevitable. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise in 2023 but at a slower pace than 2022. OPEC forecasts demand to increase by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or 2.7%, in 2023.According to smart investors, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is one of the leading oil and gas stocks to consider for a balanced portfolio. Q3 2022 was the most lucrative quarter for Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), as net income came in at $19.66 billion, revenues surged 52% year-over-year to $112.07 billion, and the company raised its quarterly dividend by 3.4% to $0.91 per share.On November 22, Citi analyst Alastair Syme raised the price target on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) to $110 from $98 and reaffirmed a Neutral rating on the shares. The market rotation into energy equities has ""further to run, even though names in our US coverage already sit at all-time highs,"" the analyst told investors. History suggests that energy firms usually perform well in an earnings recession, which is Citi's base-case for 2023, wrote the analyst.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 75 hedge funds were bullish on Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) at the end of September 2022, compared to 72 funds in the earlier quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 33.8 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, First Eagle Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industry wide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”7. Major BanksAs the global economy remains fragile heading into 2023, with high risk of stagflation or a mild recession, the effects will be felt across the banking industry as well. However, large, well-capitalized, and diversified banks should survive the market volatility relatively well. One of such banks is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), which operates worldwide through Consumer &amp; Community Banking, Corporate &amp; Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset &amp; Wealth Management segments. On November 30, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) announced that it is seeking to expand its retirement products in China, the world's second largest economy, as China officially launched its private pension system last week. Citi analyst Keith Horowitz on October 17 reiterated a Buy rating on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a $135 price target following the company's Q3 results. The analyst said the bank is ""hitting on all cylinders"" and that present share levels offer an ""excellent entry point"" for a ""quality franchise.""According to Insider Monkey’s data, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 104 in the earlier quarter. Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke, and John Campbell’s Arrowstreet Capital held a prominent stake in the company, comprising 7.5 million shares worth $788 million. Here is what Vltava Fund has to say about JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We regard JPM to be the strongest and best- managed bank in the world. It is a leader in investment banking, commercial banking, credit cards, and asset management. Its size (the largest bank in the USA, with nearly USD 4,000 billion in assets) and diversification give it a strong competitive advantage that is compounded by its cost advantages and the high costs to clients associated with switching banks. JPM’s management prides itself on running the only large bank to avoid major instability over the long term.JP Morgan’s quality and strength first became fully evident in 2008 under the leadership of its CEO Jamie Dimon. Not only did JP Morgan help to stabilize the market by taking over the failing Bear Stearns in the spring of that year, but throughout the Great Financial Crisis it was the only big US bank that did not require government assistance and it was highly profitable even in the difficult year of 2008.A well-functioning and efficient bank can be a very good long-term investment, because the interest compounding effect works well here. JPM’s return on equity (ROE) is well into the double digits and this puts it in a good position to continue producing better long-term returns than does the market. JPM has been very profitable even during years when interest rates were close to zero. The current – and perhaps not temporary – return to somewhat more normal, higher interest rates should have a significantly positive impact on the bank’s interest income and overall profitability.”6. Business ServicesThe global business support services market grew from $561.32 billion in 2021 to $621.03 billion in 2022 at a compound annual growth rate of 10.6%. The business support services market is expected to reach $835.66 billion in 2026, indicating a CAGR of 7.7%. Business-to-business, social, and business-to-consumer are the three main categories of business services. It is one of the best sectors to invest in heading into 2023. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), an American financial technology company offering transaction processing, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, is one of the best business services stocks to monitor. On November 25, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported that its U.S. payments volume in November increased 9% from a year ago, even after the company suspended its operations in Russia in March 2022, and the volume was up 10% in October 2022. On December 2, Wells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti raised the price target on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to $250 from $225 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is becoming even more involved in the global money movement ecosystem with its new products, making it harder to disintermediate them in any significant way, the analyst told investors. He thinks Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) can still deliver 20% EPS growth for the foreseeable future.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 165 hedge funds were bullish on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), compared to 166 funds in the last quarter. Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $1 billion.In addition to AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), smart investors are piling into Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) heading into 2023. Baron Funds made the following comment about Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Shares of global payment network Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) fell despite reporting financial results that beat Street forecasts and sustained volume growth in recent months. Revenue grew 19% and EPS grew 33% in the most recent quarter, and double-digit payment volume growth persisted through August. Share price weakness represented a reversal of outperformance earlier this year and may be due to foreign exchange headwinds and concerns about a potential weakening of consumer spending. We continue to own the stock due to Visa’s long runway for growth and significant competitive advantages.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023.  Suggested articles:Most Advanced Countries in Artificial Intelligence10 Youngest Hedge Fund Billionaires10 Best Performing Country ETFs in 2022 Disclosure: None. 11 Best Sectors To Invest In Heading Into 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But anyway, taking a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're seeing that open higher fractionally by about 4/10 of a percent.NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that up by about 2/10 of a percent out of the gate here. And then additionally, the S&amp;P 500, that, too, is up fractionally by about a quarter of a percent we'll call that.But as you were seeing, as I was scrolling through each of those or at least toggling through each of those major averages, we are still net lower over the past five days. So keep that in mind as we go through with this trading week as well and see where we can call back some of those declines that we've seen.Story continuesWe're taking a look at-- let's take a look at the sectors here, first, to see where we're really trending out of the gate this morning. Utilities seems to be the outsized leader as of right now. It's up by about 9/10 of a percent. You got more gainers than decliners.Bringing up the caboose. We were just talking about discretionary spending a moment ago. XLY, that is down right now by about 3/10 of a percent. And just to give you a year-to-date view of consumer discretionary as well, that's down 32% over the course of this year. So keep a close eye on that and where things actually start to settle as we move on throughout the final weeks, final trading weeks of 2022.And then just lastly, let's take a look at the NASDAQ Composite and get a view of some of the components where we're seeing the most trending activity here on the day. It actually seems like for some of the mega-cap stocks, largely in the green, except for Amazon. That's fractionally lower by about 2/10 of a percent. But Apple, Microsoft, Google or Alphabet, they are all higher here out of the gate.We were talking about chips a moment ago. NVIDIA you've got that up by about 4/10 of a percent here to start things off. And so we'll keep a close eye on those as we move on. But a lot of trading session left in today's activity, of course.JULIE HYMAN: Yep.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Defensive Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy. People invest in dividend stocks for several reasons. One reason is that these stocks can provide a regular source of income in the form of dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders. This can be especially appealing to investors who are looking for a way to generate a steady stream of income from their investments. Additionally, dividend stocks may be seen as a safer investment compared to other types of stocks, since companies that pay dividends are often more established and financially stable. This can provide investors with some peace of mind, knowing that their investment is less likely to be impacted by market volatility or other factors. Finally, many investors view dividend stocks as a good long-term investment, since they can provide both income and the potential for capital appreciation over time. Defensive stocks are those that hold up well during periods of economic downturns. The healthcare sector is considered one of the most reliable defensive industries because these companies benefit from growing consumer demand regardless of the overall economy.The onset of the pandemic of 2020 has shifted the dynamics of the global healthcare system. The healthcare industry in the US is the biggest in the world, which accounted for over 17% of the national GDP in 2020, according to a report by Insider Intelligence. The report also referred to the data by Deloitte and mentioned that health spending in the US will reach $8.3 trillion by 2040, up from $4 trillion in 2020.Over the years, the healthcare industry has generated solid revenues in the US. CNBC cited data from McKinsey &amp; Company and mentioned that the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 6% annually from 2021 through 2025, producing an additional $31 billion in profits. The same report mentioned that various healthcare companies in the US have given positive growth outlooks for the next few years. This year’s economic chaos also couldn’t target the sector as harshly as other industries. The S&amp;P 500 Health Care index is down by 2.36% year-to-date, versus a 17.97% decline in the broader market, as of December 12. The index gained 9.6% in October, recording its best month since April 2020, as reported by Bloomberg. Another report by AllianceBernstein stated that healthcare stocks have significantly outperformed in down markets from 2000 through June 2022.Story continuesThe solid performance of healthcare stocks can also be attributed to the fact that many health companies are dividend payers. Historically, dividend stocks have proved their mettle in periods of an economic clampdown. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) gained investors’ attention due to their strong dividend growth track records and solid returns this year.

The healthcare industry is complex, but we believe Elevance is well positioned to weather those challenges. Elevance is the largest healthcare insurance company in United States by medical membership, covering 47 million lives – 2/3rds of which are covered under commercial and specialty arrangements, and the other 1/3rd under government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The managed care industry is large, with healthcare spending of $4 trillion annually, and we believe that scale combined with expertise are important for success in this industry. We think that Elevance is one of a few large players who bring those strengths to bear. We estimate that Elevance will generate operating revenue north of $150 billion this year. Their size and scale allow for significant investments in technology and benefit design. We think that Elevance has good momentum and estimate that it should be able to grow its free-cash-flow per share at healthy rates despite the economy’s challenges.”10.

Lilly is one of the two key players in diabetes care and we believe the potential market opportunity is much higher than the consensus forecasts as we are seeing evidence of accelerating adoption.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the third quarter of 2022, LabCorp Diagnostics performed well with Base Business revenue growth of 3.7% year over year and a 4% CAGR versus 2019. With Ascension being organic in the upcoming quarter, the company expects full-year revenue growth of 6% to 7%.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings PriceLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings PriceLaboratory Corporation of America Holdings price | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteDrug Development Base Business fundamentals remained strong in Q3. The company expects a full-year CAGR of almost 8% since 2019. Further, LabCorp is accelerating the planned spin-off of its Clinical Development business (announced in July). The company noted that it is managing inflationary headwinds and labor constraints through its LaunchPad initiatives.In terms of portfolio enhancement, the company formed a strategic partnership with MD Anderson Cancer Center Foundation in Spain to increase access to early-phase oncology clinical trials. The company has also entered into a collaboration with Becton, Dickinson and Company to help match patients with critical and potentially life-changing treatments for cancer and other diseases. The company has also seen growing demand for its at-home testing and collection options through Labcorp OnDemand.In Oncology, LabCorp is benefiting from Personal Genome Diagnostics, an omni portfolio that includes advanced liquid biopsy, tissue-based diagnostics and kitting solutions. The company currently has the broadest portfolio and capabilities in oncology diagnostics.On the flip side, Over the past six months, LabCorp has underperformed its industry. Shares of LabCorp have declined 21.4% compared with the industry’s 15.6% fall.Story continuesLabCorp’s revenues for the third quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate and fell year over year. The decline in revenues can be attributed to a 10.7% fall in organic revenues and a 1.3% negative impact from foreign currency translation. The reduced sales growth across the company’s Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development operating segments on a reported basis raises apprehension.The ongoing decline in COVID-19 Testing sales is discouraging too. Further, the significant plunge in EPS is worrisome. The persistent inflationary pressure and the ongoing Ukraine/Russia crisis continue to impact business performance.On escalating costs, gross margin contracted 472 basis points (bps) to 29.4% in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income marked a 36.5% plunge from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin declined 606 bps from the year-ago quarter to 15.2%. This decline in adjusted operating income and margin is primarily attributable to a reduction in COVID-19 testing, higher personnel expenses and other inflationary costs during the quarter under review.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. AMN, ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV and McKesson Corporation MCK.AMN Healthcare has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.2%.

The space has generated a total return of nearly 25.9% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of around 18.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rise in oil and gas prices has brought windfall profits to energy companies, pushing their stocks up this year. As global economies reopen, demand for oil and gas has risen but supply remains tight. Several western countries have imposed restrictions on imports from Russia, one of the world's largest producers of the commodity, in the backdrop of its war with Ukraine that has been hurting the supply of oil and gas. This demand supply gap has been pushing up oil and gas prices.Major energy companies were among the best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index this year.While energy stocks have been the top performers within S&amp;P 500 this year, it is quite a volatile sector. So, it is not a bad idea to invest in some top-performing non-energy S&amp;P 500 stocks. Here we discuss three such S&amp;P 500 stocks, Merck MRK, Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX and McKesson Corporation MCK. All three companies are from the Medical sector, which is a defensive sector to invest in the present environment of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.Each of these S&amp;P 500 stocks has returned more than 40% year to date and looks well poised for the upcoming year.MerckBased in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil vaccines to prevent HPV-related cancers, is improving Merck’s sales performance.Story continuesMerck’s blockbuster cancer medicine, Keytruda is gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. Merck’s Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth, with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023.

The companies will invest approximately $4 billion to build and operate this facility under a 30-year contract.The plant will serve the growing demand for zero-carbon intensity fuels and produce an enormously clean source of energy. It will employ wind and solar energy and be the largest green hydrogen facility in the United States to do so by far.This joint venture will have an electrolyzer capacity that can produce more than 200 metric tons of green hydrogen per day. Moreover, the project can generate about 1.4 GW of wind and solar power. It is anticipated that the facility will reduce more than 50 million metric tons of CO2 throughout the project.

A judge rejected the network’s bid to toss the case in December 2021. A Fox spokesperson declined to comment.""From the highest levels down, Fox knowingly spread lies,"" Dominion said in a statement.Murdoch, 91, is the most high-profile figure to face questioning in the case, which is part of a multi-front legal campaign by Dominion against Fox and other conservative outlets and commentators who accused the company of conspiring to oust Trump.The deposition comes as special committees of the boards of directors for News Corp and Murdoch-controlled Fox Corp consider a proposal from Murdoch to re-combine, nearly a decade after the companies split.Murdoch will be questioned via videoconference on Tuesday and Wednesday by lawyers for Dominion, according to a filing in Delaware Superior Court. The session will not be open to the public.Dominion has also sought communications from Murdoch, his son Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox News personnel as it looks to prove that the network either knew the statements it aired were false or recklessly disregarded their accuracy. That is the standard of “actual malice,” which public figures must prove in order to prevail in defamation cases.Doug Mirell, a defamation lawyer who has followed the litigation, said he believes Dominion has an ""air-tight"" case for actual malice because Fox hosts pressed forward with vote-rigging allegations ""well after it was quite clear that these claims were demonstrably false.""Story continuesDominion alleged in its March 2021 lawsuit that Fox amplified the false theories to boost its ratings and stay abreast of hard-right competitors including One America News Network, which Dominion is also suing. The complaint cited instances where, in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News and falsely claimed Dominion software may have manipulated vote counts in favor of Biden.On Nov. 30, 2020, for example, Powell appeared on Sean Hannity’s program, where she falsely stated that Dominion machines “ran an algorithm that shaved off votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden. And they used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump.”Murdoch’s high-stakes deposition on Tuesday comes as Dominion has spent the past several months questioning a parade of Fox News hosts, executives and producers.On Dec. 5, Murdoch’s eldest son and executive chair and CEO of Fox Corp, Lachlan, sat for a deposition in Los Angeles. Murdoch’s other son, James Murdoch, was questioned in October.Fox hosts and co-hosts Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Jeanine Pirro and Bret Baier have also been questioned in recent months, court records show, as well as former host Lou Dobbs. Fox News Chief Executive Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace have also sat for depositions.A five-week trial in the case is scheduled to begin on April 17.(Reporting by Jack Queen and Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Amy Stevens and Matthew Lewis)]"

But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. For example, the The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) share price is down 37% in the last year. That's disappointing when you consider the market declined 17%. To make matters worse, the returns over three years have also been really disappointing (the share price is 36% lower than three years ago). The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 16% in the last three months. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Even though the Walt Disney share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It's quite possible that growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.Walt Disney managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWalt Disney is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. If you are thinking of buying or selling Walt Disney stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 17% in the twelve months, Walt Disney shareholders did even worse, losing 37%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 2% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

Nowhere is more ideal than sunny Florida and Walt Disney World, whether you decide to go with a group of friends or your immediate family. Minnie, Mickey and the gang will be there to greet you.Read: Stimulus Updates To Know for Spring 2022Save Money: Unplug These Appliances That Hike Up Your Electricity BillWhen the park opened on Oct. 1, 1971, admission to what’s now called Walt Disney World Resort was $3.50 — or a little more than $25 today. Expansion through the years, as well as technical advances even the visionary Walt Disney probably couldn’t have imagined, are among the reasons why a one-day admission now costs a minimum of $109 for adults to enter the lowest-priced of the four Disney parks on site.So just how much does a Disney World vacation cost? GOBankingRates looked at the cost of airfare and rental car, hotel stays and admission tickets to give would-be visitors a look at just how much it costs to take a trip to “the most magical place on Earth.”Getting ThereIf you want to travel this summer, rising airfares due to the increase in jet fuel prices will take a big chunk of your budget.A pre-pandemic study from CheapAir.com said the best deals on airfare pop up 76 days before a traveler wants to fly, so using that guidance, GOBankingRates looked at the cost to fly to Orlando International Airport from six random cities in the United States. These were the lowest available round-trip fares we found, sourced from Travelocity, for a four-night stay in that time frame. Prices listed are per person and do not include extra fees for upgraded seats or any checked or carry-on baggage.From Albany, New York: $287From Chattanooga, Tennessee: $293From Cincinnati: $85From Indianapolis: $133From Los Angeles: $239From Portland, Oregon: $232Tip: If you live equidistant between two airports, check fares from both. The distance between Chattanooga and Atlanta is 118 miles, but the round-trip airfare to Orlando from Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta was $75, or $218 less per ticket, when GOBankingRates checked.Story continuesPoll: Do You Think People Should Invest in Crypto?And there’s some good news on the rental car front. Prices have fallen from the sky-high prices they reached in 2021, when the sticker shock was real. Because rental car companies sold thousands of automobiles when the travel industry came to a halt in 2020, they didn’t have enough cars to fill the post-pandemic demand.Now, for our sample period, prices were much more reasonable, as sourced by Travelocity: $37 a day for a compact car, $39 for a compact SUV. The SUV price, with taxes and fees, for the four-day trip was just a few cents short of $223.Note: If you are staying at a Disney Resort hotel, Disney no longer offers its Magical Express Service from Orlando International Airport to your hotel. The service was discontinued effective Jan. 1, 2022. You’ll need to take an alternate form of transportation to your Disney hotel if you’re not renting a car, but the region’s SunRail and LYNX public transit systems can transport you throughout the area if you plan to see sites other than Disney.Many non-Disney Orlando hotels offer airport shuttles at no cost.Staying ThereThe Orlando area has more than 480 hotels and 130,000-plus rooms, so the region has an abundance of lodging choices. There are more than 30 Disney Resort hotels in what’s called the Disney Resorts Collection, and they are divided into four pricing tiers: Value, Moderate, Deluxe and Deluxe Villas.So what’s the difference between staying at a Disney hotel and a non-Disney hotel?The Disney properties generally are closer to the theme parks, allowing guests to take a boat or the monorail to get there if it’s beyond walking distance. The proximity also allows you to leave the parks during the day and return later, especially if you have little ones who could use a nap.The hotels are Disney-themed, to the delight of fans young and old, and you never know when Donald Duck or Goofy might stop by for a visit. Those staying at the hotels — and some selected off-property hotels — can sign up for the opportunity to get an early start on the day at the park with entry 30 minutes before opening to the general public.Staying off-site could be less expensive than in the value-priced to the deluxe hotels. Plus, frequent travelers can gain hotel loyalty points or redeem those they have on their Disney vacation, saving more money.GOBankingRates checked room rates at Disney properties for the selected travel dates and found that a night at the Value-category Disney’s All-Star Movies Resort costs $211.50 for a standard room. The upgraded Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort, a Moderate-category hotel, is $343.50. A standard-view room at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge, a Deluxe property, is $568.75. None of the prices listed include taxes.Off-site, Hyatt Place Orlando/Lake Buena Vista starts at $188 per night, with the Sonesta ES Suites Lake Buena Vista-Orlando priced at $213. Rooms at the luxury Ritz-Carlton Grande Lakes begin at $879. All are within 10 miles of Disney World Resort, and the prices don’t include taxes.Tip: If you’re considering staying at a Disney property, you might save money by contacting the Disney vacations department, where representatives can inform you about specials and package deals that include park tickets. If you plan to book a room off-site, look for special offers, such as stay three nights, get the fourth night free.Now That You’re ThereIt’s time to hit the parks. Since the pandemic, you must make a reservation to go to Walt Disney World Resort parks. And a ticket comes at a hefty price. The least-expensive ticket to a Disney park is $109 for ages 10 and older ($104 for ages 3 to 9) before taxes, according to the park’s website, but the actual price depends on the day you visit and which park you choose. In fact, expect to pay more for your ticket if you visit during a high-demand time, such as the week of Thanksgiving or the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, when the price is $179 for a single-day ticket to the Magic Kingdom — $5 less for ages 3 to 9 – this year. In our selected travel window, a one-day ticket price was $169, or $164 for ages 3 to 9. The prices listed on the Disney website are before sales tax.Disney World has four parks: Magic Kingdom Park, Epcot, Disney’s Hollywood Studios and Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park. Your admission is good for one park, though Disney offers the “park hopper” option for $67 extra, allowing visitors to switch to a different park after 2 p.m.With so much to see and do, you likely will want to go to the parks for more than one day, and the price drops with each day of your visit. If during your stay in our travel period you visited the Magic Kingdom for three days, the cost of two adults and two children (ages 3 to 9) for admission tickets to that one park would total $1,858 with tax. Fortunately, Disney World’s website has a calendar that shows the ticket prices for every day of the year, helping you to plan ahead for tickets at the best price.The family memories to be made on a Disney World vacation will last forever. They’ll just come at a price.More From GOBankingRates11 Grocery Items To Buy at Dollar TreeGet Top Holiday Shopping and Savings TipsThe 10 Best Rewards Credit Cards for 20237 Ways To Know You're Ready To Start InvestingThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Does It Really Cost To Go To Disney World Now?]"

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221212005705/en/(Photo: Business Wire)For the world-first live trial, Comcast connected a business location in the Philadelphia region to its live network including a DOCSIS 4.0-enabled 10G node and multiple cable modems to deliver high speed data service to the site. Comcast engineers tested symmetrical speeds over the connection and will continue trialing 10G technologies over the next several months in preparation for offering 10G-enabled services to customers in the second half of 2023.""This live trial combines years of technology innovation and versatility to create a clear path to next-generation speed, reliability and performance for all the homes in our footprint, not just a select few,"" said Charlie Herrin, President, Technology, Product, Experience at Comcast Cable. ""What excites us most about 10G technology is the ability to continue our longstanding commitment to delivering our best technologies to everyone we serve.""This live trial is the result of significant advances in 10G technology Comcast has made over the past 24 months, including several world firsts. The most recent occurred in September, when the organization completed a successful 10G amplifier test. At the same time, the company announced the start of a nationwide rollout of multi-gig Internet speeds – which will reach more than 50 million homes and businesses before the end of 2025 – making it the largest- and fastest-ever multi-gig deployment in the United States.Story continues""We started this year with the announcement of our world-first test of 10G modem technology capable of delivering multi-gig speeds to homes and, as of today, 10G is a reality with the potential to transform and evolve the Internet as we know it,"" said Elad Nafshi, EVP and Chief Network Officer at Comcast Cable.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -17%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has lost 10.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $2.11 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.77 points to a change of +148.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.02 indicates a change of +2.9% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.7%. The $19.91 billion and $19.92 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +67.1% and +0%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

297,b0821b49-bc4d-34a1-814f-fffdeb5946e6,DVN,2022-12-13,Permian Oil Drilling Rig Count Rises in 5 of Prior 10 Weeks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/permian-oil-drilling-rig-count-135701182.html,1670853421,STORY,"['EOG', 'BKR', 'DVN']","[In its weekly release, Baker Hughes Company BKR stated that the U.S. rig count was lower than the prior-week tally. The rotary rig count, issued by BKR, is usually published in major newspapers and trade publications.Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry. The number of active rigs and its comparison with the prior-week figure indicates the demand trajectory for Baker Hughes’ oilfield services from exploration and production companies.DetailsTotal U.S. Rig Count Declines: The count of rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States was 780 for the week ended Dec 9. The figure is lower than the prior week's count of 784. Thus, the tally increased in six of the previous nine weeks. The current national rig count is higher than the year-ago level of 576.The onshore rigs in the week ended Dec 9 totaled 760, lower than the prior-week count of 763. In offshore resources, 18 rigs were operating, flat with the prior week's count.U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls: The oil rig count was 625 for the week ended Dec 9, lower than the prior-week figure of 627. The current number of oil rigs — far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014 — is up from the year-ago figure of 471.U.S. Natural Gas Rig Count Declines: Natural gas rig count of 153 was lower than the prior-week figure of 155. The count of rigs exploring the commodity is higher than the prior-year week’s tally of 105. Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 90.5% lower than the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 26 units, higher than the prior-week count of 25. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology with the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) of 754 is lower than the prior-week level of 759.Story continuesGulf of Mexico (GoM) Rig Count Rises: GoM rig count was 18 units, all oil-directed. The count was higher than the prior-week number of 17.Rig Count in the Most Prolific BasinPermian — the most prolific basin in the United States — recorded a weekly oil rig tally of 346, in line with the prior week count. The tally increased in five of the prior 10 weeks.OutlookThe West Texas Intermediate crude price is trading at more than the $70-per-barrel mark, which is still highly favorable for exploration and production activities. Solid oil prices will likely pave the way for rig additions despite a slowdown in drilling activities, as upstream players mainly focus on stockholder returns rather than boosting output.Investors may keep a close eye on energy stocks like EOG Resources EOG and Devon Energy Corporation DVN, as these companies are expected to benefit from the current healthy oil price scenario.EOG Resources, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is a leading oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is well-placed to capitalize on the promising business scenario. It has an estimated 11,500 net undrilled premium locations, resulting in a brightened production outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.EOG Resources is strongly committed to returning capital to shareholders. Since it transitioned to premium drilling, the company has returned $10.4 billion in cash to stockholders. With the employment of premium drilling, EOG can reduce its cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent, thereby aiding its bottom line.Devon Energy is a well-known upstream energy firm with a strong multi-basin portfolio. Delaware basin is among the basins that contribute significant oil equivalent production to DVN.The Zacks Rank #3 firm, Devon Energy, has a prolific multi-decade inventory, posing a solid production outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

299,b3c5d248-302d-3f1c-9eb1-b612bc01f8ec,URI,2022-12-13,"RH Benefits From Strategic Moves, Soft Housing Demand Ails",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rh-benefits-strategic-moves-soft-154903855.html,1670860143,STORY,['URI'],"[Amid housing industry headwinds and inflationary pressure dampening profits, RH RH has been benefiting from prudent growth initiatives, margin expansion efforts and solid returns.Shares of this leading luxury retailer in the home furnishing space have increased 4.6% over the past three months, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 index’s 0.6% decline. This trend is expected to continue in the near term, courtesy of its better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2022 performance, supported by solid promotional moves and long-term investments.However, RH expects continued softness in business trends due to weakness in the housing market that will likely persist over the next several quarters and the Federal Reserve’s anticipated interest rate hikes. RH now expects fiscal 2022 net revenues to decline 3.5-4.5% compared with 3.5-5.5% expected earlier.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, it has raised its adjusted operating margin guidance to 21.5-22% versus 21-21.5% of its earlier projection. In the year-ago period, the metric was 25.6%.Factors Supporting RHStrategic Initiatives: Over the past five years, RH has been busy architecting a new operating platform that includes transitioning from a promotional to membership model, a distribution center network redesign, the redesign of reverse logistics and outlet businesses and the re-conceptualization of home delivery and customer experience. These initiatives have helped it lower costs and inventory levels while boosting earnings and inventory turns.RH has been emphasizing a number of strategic initiatives to evolve it from a home furnishings retailer to a luxury lifestyle brand over time, including: Product Elevation, Gallery Transformation, Brand Elevation &amp; Digital Reimagination, and Global Expansion. The Brand Elevation &amp; Digital Reimagination emphasizes on evolving the brand beyond curating and selling products to conceptualizing and selling spaces by building an ecosystem of Products, Places, Services and Spaces.Meanwhile, RH’s strategy to digitally reimagine the RH brand and business model both internally and externally bodes well. The company believes that its luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetic have a strong international appeal, and the pursuit of global expansion will provide RH with a substantial long-term market opportunity to build a $20-$25 billion global brand over time.Moreover, increased focus on its outdoor furniture stores bodes well. As of Oct 29, there were 67 RH Galleries, 39 outlet stores, one Guesthouse and 14 Waterworks showrooms operational.Margin Expansion Efforts: RH’s operating margins improved significantly over the past several quarters. From fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2021, RH significantly increased operating margins in its business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the adjusted gross margin expanded 480 bps. The upside was driven by an increase in product margins. Adjusted operating margin expanded 210 bps and adjusted EBITDA margin rose 170 bps year over year in that period.It focuses on a number of strategic initiatives that include: (i) occupancy leverage that it expects to gain from real estate transformation (ii) product margin expansion as it continues to drive higher full price selling in core business and (iii) cost savings from improvements of its operating platform and organizational structure. Although the current market situation is unfavorable for RH, these will certainly help the company in the long run.Superior ROE: RH’s superior return on equity (ROE) is indicative of growth potential. The company’s ROE currently stands at 58.9%. This compares favorably with a ROE of 15.6% for the Retail - Home Furnishings industry as a whole. This indicates RH’s efficiency in using shareholders’ funds and ability to generate profit with minimum capital usage.Story continuesMajor Headwinds Ailing RHSupply-Chain &amp; Inflationary Woes: RH has been significantly experiencing supply chain challenges, including port delays, which have impacted its ability to convert business demand into revenues at normal historical rates. Due to the supply issue across the world, the company witnessed short-term and long-term delays in the last few quarters.In the fiscal third quarter, adjusted gross margin contracted 50 basis points (bps) due to fixed occupancy deleverage. Adjusted selling, general &amp; administrative expenses rose 640 bps to 28.9% of total revenues. Adjusted operating margin contracted 690 bps and adjusted EBITDA declined 30.4% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted 600 bps year over year to 24.9%.RH expects cost pressures to persist for the balance of fiscal 2022 and into the first half of fiscal 2023, primarily across the supply chain. These headwinds include incremental distribution centers, higher product and freight costs, and efforts to best serve its customers by delivering products as timely as possible.Softening Housing Demand: RH and other industry peers are highly dependent on housing market demand. Currently, the housing industry is witnessing lower demand due to prevailing market conditions. Currently, the Fed's determination to curtail inflation through interest rate increases and quantitative tightening has started to have the desired effect of slowing down sales in some markets across the country. On Dec 14, it is likely to announce its final interest rate hike for the year. This is definitely going to hit the housing related industries as well.The housing industry is cyclical and affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. The federal government’s actions related to economic stimulus, taxation and borrowing limits could affect consumer confidence and spending levels, which could hurt both the economy and the housing market.Highly Competitive Market: The home furnishings sector is highly competitive. RH competes with the interior design trade, specialty stores, antique dealers, national and regional home furnishings retailers and department stores. In addition, the company competes with mail-order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings. Increased catalog mailings by its competitors may affect response rates to RH’s Source Book mailings. Increased competition has resulted in potential or actual litigation between RH and its competitors related to a variety of activities.Zacks Rank &amp; Key Construction PicksRH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are CRH plc CRH, Janus International Group, Inc.

Analysts, on average, projected $1.18 a share.Cloud revenue — the highly watched segment that Oracle has been trying to expand — rose 43% to $3.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, the Austin, Texas-based company said Monday in a statement. The segment produced 45% year-over-year growth in the prior quarter.The software giant, known for its database technology, sells enterprise software applications that can be used over the internet. The company also has been striving to increase its business of renting computing power and storage, which is a market called cloud infrastructure that is led by Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. At an analyst day in October, Oracle forecast a better-than-expected $65 billion in annual revenue by the 2026 fiscal year, fueled by the cloud effort.The company spent $2.4 billion toward capital expenditures in the quarter, primarily focused on data centers needed to meet cloud demand, Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said on a conference call after the results. Catz said she expects to continue to invest at that level for the “next few quarters.”Last week, Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google won a share of a $9 billion Department of Defense contract for cloud services.Story continuesOracle also is relying on its acquisition of Cerner, which was completed in June, to build inroads in health care, an industry that has been slow to move data technology to the web. Cerner generated $1.5 billion in the quarter, Oracle said.“Since the acquisition, Cerner has contributed to Oracle’s growth — and Oracle has helped Cerner improve its technology,” Chairman Larry Ellison said in the statement. “But we are just beginning our mission to modernize health care information systems.”In a note before the results were announced, Anurag Rana, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, expected the digital medical records unit “might more than offset any economic-related weakness.”Sales of the Fusion application for managing corporate finances rose 23% in the period, compared with 33% last quarter. Revenue from NetSuite’s enterprise planning tools, targeted to small- and midsize businesses, increased 25%, compared with 27% last quarter.On the call, Catz said revenue will increase 17% to 19% in the current quarter, which ends in February. Analysts, on average, projected 17% growth to $12.3 billion. Earnings per share will be as much as $1.21, including a negative impact of 6 cents a share from currency fluctuations, she said. Analysts estimated $1.24 a share.The CEO repeated her forecast from September that Oracle’s fiscal-year cloud sales, excluding Cerner’s contribution, would increase 30% on a constant currency basis. The cloud business growth will “exceed 30%” including Cerner, she said.The stock gained about 2% in extended trading after closing at $81.28 in New York. Oracle has been one of the best performing tech stocks in recent months. The shares have jumped 33% since the end of September, compared with a 12% rise in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index.--With assistance from Ian King.(Updates with comments from CEO beginning in the fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Cocaine-Smuggling Cartel Infiltrated the World’s Biggest Shipping CompanyChina’s iPhone Factory Stumbles Give India a Chance to Swoop InLong Covid’s Effects Go Beyond Respiratory IssuesA Racist Tweet Wasn’t the Only Problem at Elite London FirmAmEx Hooked Big Spenders and Regained the Throne With a Pricier Platinum Card©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

The S&amp;P 500 had a strong +1.43%, while the Nasdaq gained +139 points, or +1.26%. Even the small-cap Russell 2000 reached +1.20% in the session. It was a very good start to bounce back from the single-worst trading week since September.Transportation stocks rose the highest today, around +3%, partly on cheaper fuel prices of late, particularly in diesel (although the Keystone pipeline shutdown may have something to say about this going forward). But more likely this illustrates market participants expecting good things from tomorrow’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for November: consensus headline CPI year over year is currently +7.3%, down 40 basis points (bps) month over month. If, for some reason, we find ourselves even lower on year-over-year CPI, we could see that “Santa Claus Rally” that has so far eluded us.It was June of this year that saw a 41-year peak in CPI metrics, which interest rate hikes have since been helping bring down, at +9.1%. Last month, four months later, we’d already rolled off to +7.7% — still high, but -140 bps from the peak, and a clear downward trajectory over time. We haven’t seen a sub-7% CPI number in the past 12 months. But even though last week’s sister report, the PPI, did not reach consensus estimates lower, they were still down month over month — a good thing.The added benefit a lower CPI print tomorrow would offer is some assurance the Fed is not going to shift gears at the last minute and raise interest rates another 75 bps; 50 bps is currently baked into market projections. Thus, we’d finally get some “good news is good news” — a lower inflation read leading to a better outcome from the Fed — instead of “good news is bad news,” as we’ve been living through for months.Austin, TX-based Oracle Corp. ORCL reported fiscal Q2 results after the closing bell, unto itself in earnings reportage. It did not disappoint: earnings of $1.21 per share outpaced expectations by 4 cents, while revenues of $12.28 billion surpassed the $12.03 billion anticipated. Oracle only has two earnings misses in the past five years, but they were both within the past four quarters.Oracle says its earnings beat would have been 9 cents per share higher, had it not been for foreign exchange costs. The company’s deferred revenue came in hotter than expected, which has not been the case for other big tech names during this past earnings season. Shares of ORCL have climbed nearly +3% in late-trading; the Zacks #2-ranked company is now down mid-single-digits year to date.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

This compares to earnings of $1.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.42%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this software maker would post earnings of $1.07 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.03, delivering a surprise of -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Oracle , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $12.28 billion for the quarter ended November 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.01%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $10.36 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Oracle shares have lost about 8.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -17.5%.What's Next for Oracle?While Oracle has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Oracle: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.24 on $12.31 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.96 on $49.57 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Software is currently in the top 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Micron Technology:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$9.7b ÷ (US$66b - US$7.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Micron Technology has an ROCE of 17%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 16% generated by the Semiconductor industry. See our latest analysis for Micron Technology roceIn the above chart we have measured Micron Technology's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Micron Technology.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 17% and the business has deployed 96% more capital into its operations. 17% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Micron Technology has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Micron Technology's ROCETo sum it up, Micron Technology has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 27% return to shareholders who held over that period. That's why it could be worth your time looking into this stock further to discover if it has more traits of a multi-bagger.If you're still interested in Micron Technology it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

It can no longer serve Big Macs, nor use the McDonald's-style sauce, Paroev explained.""(The Big Hit) has its own sauce and a slightly different composition, a different layout of ingredients, but in terms of quality and taste it is very good,"" Paroev said.""We hope Russian consumers will appreciate the Big Hit and that it will become as much of a symbol of Vkusno &amp; tochka as the Big Mac is a symbol of McDonald's.GOVOR'S ACQUISITIONSSince acquiring Russia's McDonald's restaurants, Govor has snapped up Finnish packaging company Huhtamaki's Russian business and a logistics firm, set to be renamed ""Logistics &amp; that's it"".On Monday, he said Vkusno &amp; tochka may try to find a partner to produce children's toys for the Kids' Combo, which currently include a free book, but that his M&amp;A appetite had been satisfied for now.Vkusno &amp; tochka and meat producer Miratorg on Monday said they had agreed to build a factory in 2023 to supply the chain with chips and potato wedges. Some Vkusno &amp; tochka restaurants had to take fries off the menu this year when faced with a potato shortage.""We were simply forced to do this,"" Govor said. ""We were looking for partners because some of our suppliers, including of potatoes, have doubled their prices from February to today.""

Rowe Price Group (NASDAQ:TROW) stock falls 3.1% in past week as one-year earnings and shareholder returns continue downward trend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-rowe-price-group-nasdaq-152514475.html,1670858714,STORY,['TROW'],"[The simplest way to benefit from a rising market is to buy an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) share price is down 38% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 19%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 2.8% in the last three years. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 10% in thirty days.If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for T. Rowe Price Group isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price. See our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, T. Rowe Price Group had to report a 35% decline in EPS over the last year. We note that the 38% share price drop is very close to the EPS drop. Therefore one could posit that the market has not become more concerned about the company, despite the lower EPS. Instead, the change in the share price seems to reduction in earnings per share, alone.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on T. Rowe Price Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of T. Rowe Price Group, it has a TSR of -36% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that T. Rowe Price Group shareholders are down 36% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 19%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand T. Rowe Price Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

These stocks are looking like ideal candidates for a potential end-of-year Santa Clause rally.Two stocks that come to mind are American Express AXP and Capital One Financial COF, with both still well off their 52-week highs. Let’s see if it’s time to buy these two lending and banking giants’ stocks going into 2023.American Express (AXP)Starting with financial services giant American Express, AXP is only down -4% YTD Vs. The S&amp;P 500’s -19%. This has outperformed the Financial-Miscellaneous Services -22% drop. Even better, over the last five years, AXP’s total return is +72% to beat the benchmark and crush its Zacks Subindustry’s -19%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Express is focused on credit payment card products along with travel-related services with sales projected to climb 25% in 2022 at $52.92 billion. Fiscal 2023 sales are expected to jump another 12%.On the bottom line, earnings are expected to decline -1% in Fiscal 2022 at $9.91 per share. This is a clear indication that operating costs have been challenging for American Express this year. However, earnings estimate revisions are slightly up from $9.87 a share 90 days ago. FY23 earnings are forecasted to jump 10% but earnings estimates have trended down over the last quarter.  AXP is still 21% off its 52-week highs trading around $157 a share. At current levels, American Express stock trades at 15.5X forward earnings. This is higher than the industry average of 10.2X but American Express has been a clear industry leader. Plus, AXP trades nicely below its decade high of 25.4X and closer to the median of 14.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAXP currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and offers a modest 1.35% dividend yield at $2.08 per share. The average Zacks Price Target also suggests 7% upside from current levels.Capital One Financial (COF) Also landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is Capital One Financial (COF). Capital One has evolved into a consumer and commercial lending giant along with deposit origination and banking services.Story continuesSales are forecasted to jump 12% in 2022 and rise another 7% in FY23 to $36.49 billion. However, on the bottom line earnings are expected to drop -30% this year at $18.78 per share. FY23 earnings are projected to decline another -15% to $16.01 a share. It is important to note that earnings estimates have also trended down for FY22 and FY23.Still, Capital One’s valuation is starting to make its stock look poised for an extended rally. Trading 40% off its 52-week highs at around $97 a share COF trades at just 5X forward earnings. This is slightly below the industry average of 6.6X and 85% below its decade-high of 34.7X. Even better, COF trades at a 47% discount to its decade median of 9.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChallenges in Capital One’s bottom line are starting to look priced into the stock at current levels.Capital One stock is down -33% year to date to underperform the S&amp;P 500. COF’s YTD decline has been on par with its peer group which includes notable companies such as Discover Financial Services DFS and Ally Financial ALLY. However, Over the last two years, Capital One’s total return is +11% to outperform the benchmark and its peers -20%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCapital One’s top-line growth is more impressive than Discover Financial and Ally Financial in addition to its low valuation making the stock stand out among these equities.With COF trading very reasonably relative to its past, the stock certainly looks like a candidate for an end-of-year rally after this year’s large drop. Capital One offers investors a generous 2.54% annual dividend yield at $2.40 a share. Even better, the average Zacks Price target suggests 35% upside from current levels.Bottom Line American Express and Capital One stocks are starting to look intriguing heading into 2023. Both stocks could be poised for a rebound at some point and their valuations seem to support this from a price-to-earnings perspective.Although there may be more short-term weakness ahead and possibly better buying opportunities it may be worth holding these stocks in the portfolio. Both AXP and COF offer solid dividends to support patient investors and have promising top-line growth despite the tougher operating environment weighing on their bottom lines at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, The AES Corp. AES, NRG Energy Inc. NRG, NiSource Inc. NI and PPL Corp. PPL.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Utility Stocks to Stay Safe in a Likely Volatile WeekWe are in the last month of a disappointing 2022. Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.9%, 17.5% and 29.7%, respectively. Fluctuations in the market are also likely this week as the decision regarding the next round of interest rate hike will come on Dec 14, after the conclusion of the Fed FOMC meeting.Moreover, several major economic data of November such as, consumer price index, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization will be released this week. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthened your portfolio. We have selected five utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are - American Electric Power Co. Inc., The AES Corp.,NRG Energy Inc., NiSource Inc. and PPL Corp.Utilities Immune to the Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Story continuesConsequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Year to date, out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, 10 are in negative territory, except the energy sector. Of these 10 sectors, utilities suffered the least. The utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) dropped marginally by 1.1%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions within the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Record-high inflation and its consequence in the form of an extremely hawkish Fed have pushed investors’ confidence down to its nadir. Concerns regarding slowing economic growth and a possible recession have resulted in severe volatility throughout the year.Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have tumbled 7.9%, 17.5% and 29.7%, respectively. Fluctuations in the market are also likely this week as the decision regarding the next round of interest rate hike will come on Dec 14, after the conclusion of the Fed FOMC meeting.Moreover, several major economic data of November such as, consumer price index, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization will be released this week. Wall Street is currently in a “Catch 22 Situation.” Strong economic data will ensure solid fundamentals of the U.S. economy. On the other hand, it will give the Fed a reason to continue its aggressive rate hike and monetary tightening to combat inflation.At this stage, it should be fruitful to invest in defensive stocks like utilities to strengthened your portfolio. We have selected five utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies are - American Electric Power Co. Inc. AEP, The AES Corp. AES, NRG Energy Inc. NRG NiSource Inc. NI and PPL Corp. PPL.Utilities Immune to the Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle. It's because these companies provide basic services like electricity, gas, water and telecommunications, which can never go out of demand.Consequently, adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition. Moreover, the sector is known for the stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows.  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income-oriented investors.Story continuesUtility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business. This lends their revenues a high level of certainty. These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business, which shields them from foreign currency translation issues.Additionally, utilities are generally low-beta stocks (beta &gt;0 but &lt;1). At this stage, investment in low-beta stocks with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option.If the market’s northbound journey is reestablished, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if market’s downturn continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payment will act as a regular income stream.Year to date, out of the 11 broad sectors of the S&amp;P 500 Index, 10 are in negative territory, except the energy sector. Of these 10 sectors, utilities suffered the least. The utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) dropped marginally by 1.1%.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers.

324,d1807428-a246-3a0c-9500-6016eaa3451f,ZBH,2022-12-13,Returns On Capital At Zimmer Biomet Holdings (NYSE:ZBH) Have Stalled,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-zimmer-biomet-holdings-110407283.html,1670929447,STORY,['ZBH'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Zimmer Biomet Holdings (NYSE:ZBH) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Zimmer Biomet Holdings is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.07 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$21b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Zimmer Biomet Holdings has an ROCE of 7.0%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 11%. Check out our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Zimmer Biomet Holdings compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Zimmer Biomet Holdings.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThings have been pretty stable at Zimmer Biomet Holdings, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So unless we see a substantial change at Zimmer Biomet Holdings in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, Zimmer Biomet Holdings isn't compounding its earnings but is generating stable returns on the same amount of capital employed. And investors may be recognizing these trends since the stock has only returned a total of 11% to shareholders over the last five years. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.If you want to continue researching Zimmer Biomet Holdings, you might be interested to know about the 3 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Here are two that investors may want to consider for diversification on a global scale as we head into the new year.Mondelez International MDLZ With operations in more than 80 countries outside of the United States, Mondelez International is worthy of investors’ consideration and currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Mondelez International's operating segments include – Latin America, Asia, the Middle East &amp; Africa, Europe, and North America. Mondelez produces snack food products including chocolates, biscuits, cookies, crackers, gum &amp; candy, along with beverages, cheese, and grocery products.The company has many popular brands including Oreo cookies, Toblerone chocolate, and Trident gum among others. Mondelez’s earnings are now expected to rise 2% in 2022 and another 5% in FY23 to $3.09 per share. This year’s earnings estimate revisions have trended up over the last 90 days while FY23 is slightly down.Sales are projected to climb 8% this year and rise 5% in FY23 to $32.68 billion. FY23 sales would represent 26% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $25.86 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYear to date MDLZ is up +1% Vs. the S&amp;P 500’s -19%. This has slightly lagged the Food Miscellaneous Market’s +3% YTD performance. Over the last five years, MDLZ’s total return is +75% to beat the benchmark and crush its Zacks Subindustry’s +20%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegarding Mondelez International’s total return, the company offers a generous 2.30% annual dividend yield at $1.54 per share. This is much higher than the industry average dividend yield of 0.11%.Trading around $67 a share, MDLZ trades at 22.8X forward earnings. This is slightly above the industry average of 19.7X but Mondelez has been a leader. Plus, MDLZ is trading nicely below its decade-high of 26.4X and closer to the median of 20.9X.Story continuesIn addition to its solid dividend, the average Zacks Price Target still suggests 6% upside from current levels.  Nestle NSRGY Famous Toll House chocolate chip maker Nestle (NSRGY) looks like a strong investment going into 2023. Nestle is considered the world’s #1 food company as the global leader in coffee (Nescafe), mineral water (Perrier), and ophthalmology.Nestle’s famous snack products include Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars. The company also produces the popular dog food brand Alpo.Nestles stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with earnings estimates on the rise. Earnings are now projected to rise 2% in 2022 at $4.96 per share. This is up from estimates of $4.89 a share 90 days ago. FY23 earnings are expected to climb another 7% with estimates also trending higher over the last quarter.On the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 9% this year and another 4% in FY23 to $102.22 billion. FY23 sales would be a 9% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $93.46 billion. This is impressive growth for a mature company of Nestle’s size.Nestle stock is down -16% Year to date to slightly outperform the S&amp;P 500. This has underperformed the Food-Miscellaneous Markets +3% YTD performance. However, over the last five years, Nestle’s total return is +49% to beat its Zacks Subindustry’s +20% and slightly trail the benchmark. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $117 per share and 17% from its highs, Nestle stock trades at 23.5X forward earnings. This is above the industry average of 19.7X but Nestle trades at a nice discount relative to its past. Nestle trades 20% below its decade high of 29.2X and closer to the median of 21.7X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, the average Zacks Price Target of $132 per share suggests 13% upside from current levels.Bottom Line With the Food Miscellaneous Industry currently in the top 18% of over 250 Zacks Industries, Nestle and Mondelez International provide unique global diversification in the space. Food consumption could be higher amid economic uncertainty in the global economy, making both companies worthy of consideration going into 2023.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The national gas price average currently stands at $3.26 a gallon. And for more on the energy sector, let's bring in Bill Baruch, Blue Line Futures President. And, Bill, always good to see you here. We can get into the nitty gritty weeds of the futures market in a little bit. But first, your comment on these declining gas prices, which we kind of saw up until now, and also coming off the election. But they're here, and they are resonating in the public's mind.BILL BARUCH: You're right. I mean, there's been a bit more tepid demand than the market was really prepared for. We've seen really this price action come down in the $2 gasoline futures and retest that level when it was Omicron breaking in November, Thanksgiving of last year. So this is a pretty big-- pretty big level. I think there's a lot of support down here, and we're actually getting excited at this.But if you look at jet fuel inventory levels, sort of in line with historical averages. That's something relative to all the travel. You're seeing the numbers there. It's showing-- more alludes to tepid demand. Crack spreads have come in. And then also, I think overall, there's a lot of sentiment taking this further as some liquidation comes into the market when it hit some levels.SEANA SMITH: So, Bill, I guess it sounds like this is presenting a pretty good buying opportunity, at least from your perspective.BILL BARUCH: Yeah. Yeah, we've looked at it as a buying opportunity. I was joking around in interviews I've done in recent weeks and months that I've probably done as little in the energy space as I have done the last-- probably my whole career. I have sort of just been patient, and patience was really going to bring opportunity. And now we're seeing crude oil WTI contract get to $70. There's a lot of support down there on a technical basis, but also on a psychological basis. You don't want to see it break and close below 70.Story continuesBut-- so futures portfolios that were trading very actively, I'm getting long in some call spreads in the February contract, 77 and a half, $81 call spreads. They're under $1. I think there's some pretty good upside there on a good rebound. We're also buying OXY in securities portfolios. I think there's really tremendous value. It's a great trading vehicle we've used for much of the year.JARED BLIKRE: I wanted to ask you that there had been a bit of a discrepancy between XLE-- that's the S&amp;P 500 energy sector-- the way that was trading and the way crude oil was trading. And not that they're always supposed to be in lockstep, but energy final-- energy stocks finally came down a bit to meet crude oil prices, which has declined. And then taking your thesis that energy prices, at least WTI above $70, is constructively bullish, anything besides OXY? Are you liking the sector as a whole? What other energy stocks would you be thinking about buying here?BILL BARUCH: Yeah, we're very bullish in the sector as a whole. We've had between 15% and 20% exposure in the energy stocks, in those portfolios this year. We dialed back in a couple of recent weeks, kind of fearful in the crack spreads. So Phillips 66 is one that we had stepped out of. Kind of rolling back, I think, a little more of a high beta play in OXY here.But historical averages, if you look at the relative-- XLE relative to crude oil, I mean, it was beaten down over the past, really, 18 months. And this is a rebound back towards the more historical mean. So I think this is something to keep in mind. You know, overall, broadly, crude oil is an area-- $50 to $70 I'd like to just broadly think as, you know, vicious volatility can happen in between it. But there's good bull markets well out above 70, 80 area that can anchor, but vicious volatility between that. And then bear markets below that $50 benchmark.So I think right now, if we hold 70, I remain very upbeat. But again, it's a very underinvested space. And these companies, they have tremendous free cash flow. Free cash flow yields like OXY, 12%, 13%. I mean, Exxon, 10%. Pioneer right around, I think, 10%. And, I mean, a lot of these companies, I mean, the cash flow is terrific. They've got themselves and their balance sheets into a really great spot here for the foreseeable future, given especially an underinvested industry. I remain very bullish.SEANA SMITH: Bill, what about the biggest drivers of the price action that we've seen recently? Because I think a lot of traders heading into the month of December thought it was going to be a tough month when it comes to oil because of the Russian sanctions on-- the sanctions on Russian oil, excuse me, that were going into effect this month. But it simply looks like demand seems to be the number one driving factor. Is that true?BILL BARUCH: Yeah, I think the demand is, like I said, a little weaker than one would expect. And you're seeing that with some of the crack spread movement, a bunch of different indicators that are out there. But I think broadly speaking, the headwind has been the SPR release. And I think that's going to become a more bullish factor as you look into next year.The other factor, too, I think, again, this is a market-- the underlying crude oil prices, these global growth fears that really became very relevant last week. And they've been relevant for weeks prior as well. But I think last week really kind of started to get that-- people scared in just kind of a lot of the headlines. So I think a lot of liquidation really took place.But the other side of that is the China reopening. And it's not something that's going to happen all at once. It's something that's going to happen sort of slowly, marginally through the first quarter of next year. And I think a lot of-- there's a lot of longs in the space that were sort of leaning on this China reopening. And the fact that we couldn't get out above $83 technical resistance, I think, just led to a lot of liquidations through last week. And then if you were patient enough and you weren't caught up in that windfall of price action, then the opportunity is here for you.JARED BLIKRE: All right, real quick here, SPR refueling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at $70 per barrel. Is that a floor? Is that something big? At least in my mind, I haven't heard of a floor in terms of US crude prices in some time. What does this mean to you?BILL BARUCH: We haven't heard a lot of jawboning in recent sessions. But you go back a couple of weeks, OPEC Plus was clearly looking at $70 in WTI as an area of-- to lean against and jawbone, $80 in brent, roughly speaking, as an area that we would hear some jargon coming from. And if we don't see an uptick in global growth, we're likely to see potentially more production withheld in the coming meetings. And that's going to be a bullish factor.There was a bit of keepaway, I think, that was being played because the White House said they were looking for $70 or below $70 to start replenishing that SPR. So I think a good response off the $70 level here today. There's definitely, I think, a great trade. But the incoming news, I mean, CPI tomorrow is going to be a big one.And the Fed and the narrative that we get from the Fed and the rate hikes to come here in what would be a rate hike on Wednesday as well as coming in February, I think that's going to just be a good pulse on the risk-- the risk environment. You need to keep a pulse of the risk environment in order to really kind of trade this market and navigate. But for now, that's a really good response off $70. I think there's room to run. But again, it's going to be a very volatile week.JARED BLIKRE: All right, got to leave it there. Bill Baruch, thank you, as always.]"

These stocks are looking like ideal candidates for a potential end-of-year Santa Clause rally.Two stocks that come to mind are American Express AXP and Capital One Financial COF, with both still well off their 52-week highs. Let’s see if it’s time to buy these two lending and banking giants’ stocks going into 2023.American Express (AXP)Starting with financial services giant American Express, AXP is only down -4% YTD Vs. The S&amp;P 500’s -19%. This has outperformed the Financial-Miscellaneous Services -22% drop. Even better, over the last five years, AXP’s total return is +72% to beat the benchmark and crush its Zacks Subindustry’s -19%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Express is focused on credit payment card products along with travel-related services with sales projected to climb 25% in 2022 at $52.92 billion. Fiscal 2023 sales are expected to jump another 12%.On the bottom line, earnings are expected to decline -1% in Fiscal 2022 at $9.91 per share. This is a clear indication that operating costs have been challenging for American Express this year. However, earnings estimate revisions are slightly up from $9.87 a share 90 days ago. FY23 earnings are forecasted to jump 10% but earnings estimates have trended down over the last quarter.  AXP is still 21% off its 52-week highs trading around $157 a share. At current levels, American Express stock trades at 15.5X forward earnings. This is higher than the industry average of 10.2X but American Express has been a clear industry leader. Plus, AXP trades nicely below its decade high of 25.4X and closer to the median of 14.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAXP currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and offers a modest 1.35% dividend yield at $2.08 per share. The average Zacks Price Target also suggests 7% upside from current levels.Capital One Financial (COF) Also landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) is Capital One Financial (COF). Capital One has evolved into a consumer and commercial lending giant along with deposit origination and banking services.Story continuesSales are forecasted to jump 12% in 2022 and rise another 7% in FY23 to $36.49 billion. However, on the bottom line earnings are expected to drop -30% this year at $18.78 per share. FY23 earnings are projected to decline another -15% to $16.01 a share. It is important to note that earnings estimates have also trended down for FY22 and FY23.Still, Capital One’s valuation is starting to make its stock look poised for an extended rally. Trading 40% off its 52-week highs at around $97 a share COF trades at just 5X forward earnings. This is slightly below the industry average of 6.6X and 85% below its decade-high of 34.7X. Even better, COF trades at a 47% discount to its decade median of 9.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChallenges in Capital One’s bottom line are starting to look priced into the stock at current levels.Capital One stock is down -33% year to date to underperform the S&amp;P 500. COF’s YTD decline has been on par with its peer group which includes notable companies such as Discover Financial Services DFS and Ally Financial ALLY. However, Over the last two years, Capital One’s total return is +11% to outperform the benchmark and its peers -20%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCapital One’s top-line growth is more impressive than Discover Financial and Ally Financial in addition to its low valuation making the stock stand out among these equities.With COF trading very reasonably relative to its past, the stock certainly looks like a candidate for an end-of-year rally after this year’s large drop. Capital One offers investors a generous 2.54% annual dividend yield at $2.40 a share. Even better, the average Zacks Price target suggests 35% upside from current levels.Bottom Line American Express and Capital One stocks are starting to look intriguing heading into 2023. Both stocks could be poised for a rebound at some point and their valuations seem to support this from a price-to-earnings perspective.Although there may be more short-term weakness ahead and possibly better buying opportunities it may be worth holding these stocks in the portfolio. Both AXP and COF offer solid dividends to support patient investors and have promising top-line growth despite the tougher operating environment weighing on their bottom lines at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Ulta Beauty (ULTA) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Ulta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy, representing 75% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for ULTABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for ULTACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Ulta here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Ulta, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank.

Although e-commerce was growing at a fast pace, people finally realized the convenience and security associated with this mode only after they were compelled to shop online on fears of contracting COVID-19.This also has been helping the retail sector as the majority of the sales are now happening online. Given this scenario, stocks with a strong online presence like Vera Bradley, Inc. VRA, Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, Ross Stores, Inc. ROST and Five Below, Inc. FIVE are expected to benefit in the near term.E-Commerce Continues to GrowAccording to the Department of Commerce, e-commerce sales in the United States broke the $1 trillion threshold for the first time and totaled $1.02 trillion in the past 12 months in November. This comes despite soaring commodity prices that have been hampering sales for months now.Even then, online sales are projected to grow 9% in 2022. E-commerce has been playing a major role in driving overall retail sales amid struggles this year. Online sales were particularly on the rise in the third quarter.According to the Census Bureau, retail sales totaled $1,792 billion in the third quarter, up 0.7% over the second quarter. Online sales rose 10.8% year over year and 3% month over month to reach $265.9 billion.Moreover, e-commerce accounted for 14.8% of overall retail sales in the third quarter.This comes as Adobe Analytics reported that Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales hit record highs this year, marking a great start to the holiday season. According to the report, Cyber Monday sales increased 5.8% year over year, totaling $11.3 billion. Cyber Monday sales were $10.7 billion in 2021 and $10.8 billion in 2020, respectively. The sales figures for this year set a new record after declining 1.4% in 2021.Online purchases on Black Friday surpassed $9.12 billion, also setting a record. Overall e-commerce sales on Black Friday were up 2.3% from the prior year. In 2020, Black Friday sales came in at $9.03 billion.Story continuesE-commerce growth has been enormous over the past two years. Although the pandemic gave it a boost, the trend has since continued. In fact, it was earlier predicted that e-commerce spending would reach $1 trillion in 2024, but the goal has already been met this year, demonstrating the enormous potential.Clearly, the market has doubled in size in just three years. Spending on online purchases has increased by 25% from the pre-pandemic levels. Had the pandemic not struck and the market continued to expand at its long-term growth rate of 14% to 15%, total online sales would have been around $815 billion, down about $200 billion.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it would be wise to invest in these four stocks with a strong online presence.

The space has generated a total return of nearly 25.9% in 2022 against the S&amp;P 500’s decline of around 18.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe rise in oil and gas prices has brought windfall profits to energy companies, pushing their stocks up this year. As global economies reopen, demand for oil and gas has risen but supply remains tight. Several western countries have imposed restrictions on imports from Russia, one of the world's largest producers of the commodity, in the backdrop of its war with Ukraine that has been hurting the supply of oil and gas. This demand supply gap has been pushing up oil and gas prices.Major energy companies were among the best-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index this year.While energy stocks have been the top performers within S&amp;P 500 this year, it is quite a volatile sector. So, it is not a bad idea to invest in some top-performing non-energy S&amp;P 500 stocks. Here we discuss three such S&amp;P 500 stocks, Merck MRK, Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX and McKesson Corporation MCK. All three companies are from the Medical sector, which is a defensive sector to invest in the present environment of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.Each of these S&amp;P 500 stocks has returned more than 40% year to date and looks well poised for the upcoming year.MerckBased in Kenilworth, NJ, Merck boasts more than six blockbuster drugs in its portfolio, with PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, approved for several types of cancer, alone accounting for around 40% of the company’s pharmaceutical sales. An ongoing recovery from the disruptions related to the pandemic and strong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for Keytruda and Gardasil vaccines to prevent HPV-related cancers, is improving Merck’s sales performance.Story continuesMerck’s blockbuster cancer medicine, Keytruda is gaining from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers. Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally.With continued label expansion into new indications &amp; early-stage settings, Keytruda is expected to remain a key top-line driver. Merck’s Animal Health business has been a key contributor to its top-line growth, with the company recording above-market growth. The trend is expected to continue in 2023. Merck boasts a strong cancer pipeline, including Keytruda, which should help drive long-term growth.Merck’s stock has risen 41.9% this year so far.

With its four CF medicines, Vertex is treating the majority of the 83,000 patients living with CF in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. Vertex’s CF sales continue to grow driven by its triple therapy, Trikafta/Kaftrio. New reimbursement agreements in ex-U.S. markets and label expansions to younger age groups in the United States are driving Trikafta/Kaftrio sales higher. Vertex faces only minimal competition in its core CF franchise.While Vertex’s main focus is on the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- to late-stage pipeline in seven additional diseases beyond CF like acute pain, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases (AMKD), alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and cell therapy for type I diabetes.

The AT-6 leverages millions of dollars in the U.S. Air Force’s T-6, A-10C and MC-12 platforms.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week's US$2.6b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 9.1% losses.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Norfolk Southern. See our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Norfolk Southern?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Norfolk Southern already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Norfolk Southern's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Norfolk Southern. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 7.6% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 5.6% of the stock.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Norfolk SouthernThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Norfolk Southern Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$65m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 28% stake in Norfolk Southern. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Norfolk Southern  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Defensive Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy. People invest in dividend stocks for several reasons. One reason is that these stocks can provide a regular source of income in the form of dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders. This can be especially appealing to investors who are looking for a way to generate a steady stream of income from their investments. Additionally, dividend stocks may be seen as a safer investment compared to other types of stocks, since companies that pay dividends are often more established and financially stable. This can provide investors with some peace of mind, knowing that their investment is less likely to be impacted by market volatility or other factors. Finally, many investors view dividend stocks as a good long-term investment, since they can provide both income and the potential for capital appreciation over time. Defensive stocks are those that hold up well during periods of economic downturns. The healthcare sector is considered one of the most reliable defensive industries because these companies benefit from growing consumer demand regardless of the overall economy.The onset of the pandemic of 2020 has shifted the dynamics of the global healthcare system. The healthcare industry in the US is the biggest in the world, which accounted for over 17% of the national GDP in 2020, according to a report by Insider Intelligence. The report also referred to the data by Deloitte and mentioned that health spending in the US will reach $8.3 trillion by 2040, up from $4 trillion in 2020.Over the years, the healthcare industry has generated solid revenues in the US. CNBC cited data from McKinsey &amp; Company and mentioned that the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 6% annually from 2021 through 2025, producing an additional $31 billion in profits. The same report mentioned that various healthcare companies in the US have given positive growth outlooks for the next few years. This year’s economic chaos also couldn’t target the sector as harshly as other industries. The S&amp;P 500 Health Care index is down by 2.36% year-to-date, versus a 17.97% decline in the broader market, as of December 12. The index gained 9.6% in October, recording its best month since April 2020, as reported by Bloomberg. Another report by AllianceBernstein stated that healthcare stocks have significantly outperformed in down markets from 2000 through June 2022.Story continuesThe solid performance of healthcare stocks can also be attributed to the fact that many health companies are dividend payers. Historically, dividend stocks have proved their mettle in periods of an economic clampdown. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) gained investors’ attention due to their strong dividend growth track records and solid returns this year.

Elevance is the largest healthcare insurance company in United States by medical membership, covering 47 million lives – 2/3rds of which are covered under commercial and specialty arrangements, and the other 1/3rd under government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The managed care industry is large, with healthcare spending of $4 trillion annually, and we believe that scale combined with expertise are important for success in this industry. We think that Elevance is one of a few large players who bring those strengths to bear. We estimate that Elevance will generate operating revenue north of $150 billion this year. Their size and scale allow for significant investments in technology and benefit design. We think that Elevance has good momentum and estimate that it should be able to grow its free-cash-flow per share at healthy rates despite the economy’s challenges.”10.

Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Small-Cap ETFs in 2022.Investing in small-cap ETFs over large-cap equities can be a wise move for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Small-cap ETFs provide investors with exposure to a wide range of small-cap companies that may offer higher returns than large-cap stocks over the long term. Small-cap stocks are less established, meaning they tend to be more volatile than larger stocks. This means that the potential for gain, or loss, is greater.Analyst Bullish on Small CapsOn December 7, Bank of America's head of U.S. small and mid cap strategy, Jill Carey Hall, made the bull case for small caps in an interview on CNBC. According to Jill Carey Hall, there is more downside risk for large caps, relative to small caps. The analyst believes ""small caps could hold up better"" since they are ""more adequately pricing in a recession"". Jill Carey Hall noted that the current market situation has the same theme as the downturns in the 1970s and 1980s period, and during those downturns, small caps outperformed relative to large caps.Demand for Small-Cap ETFs is StrongOn December 8, Cinthia Murphy, ETF Think Tank Director of Research, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance Live where she discussed small-cap ETFs and trends around them. Cinthia Murphy noted that small-cap ETFs have seen a surge in demand and investor attention over the last month. Here is Cinthia Murphy's bull case for small caps:""In a post recessionary environment, small caps tend to outperform large caps. They are also currently at their cheapest valuation, relative to large caps, in something like 20 years. In the last month (November 2022) alone, more than 80% of all small-cap ETFs picked up assets. The small-cap value is even stronger, because value is the factor that's working relative to growth.""Story continuesWhile large-cap blue chips such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are typically safe and good long-term investments, for risk-averse investors looking to diversify their portfolios and increase their exposure to small-cap equities, small-cap ETFs can be a decent investment vehicle. Small-cap ETFs also offer investors the advantage of diversification and increased liquidity. Investors can gain exposure to a range of small companies, reducing the risk of investing in just one company, and can buy and sell shares more easily, which can help to reduce the cost of trading. This piece will focus on some of the best-performing small-cap ETFs in 2022.Source:unsplashOur MethodologyTo compile this list, we screened for small-cap ETFs and filtered out the highest-returning ETFs from them.

(NYSE: DEN) (""Denbury"") and Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE: WY) (""Weyerhaeuser"") today announced an agreement for the evaluation and potential development of a CO2 sequestration site in Mississippi. The lease agreement provides Denbury with the exclusive right to develop and operate approximately 16,000 acres of subsurface pore space owned by Weyerhaeuser in Simpson and Copiah Counties in Mississippi. The site is located directly adjacent to Denbury’s NEJD Pipeline in Mississippi, approximately 35 miles south of the company’s Jackson Dome field. Denbury is planning to utilize the site to permanently sequester industrial CO2 in secure underground geologic formations. Weyerhaeuser will continue to manage the timberland acreage as a sustainable working forest.Denbury estimates the site will have total sequestration capacity of approximately 275 million metric tons of CO2. The site represents Denbury’s first planned CO2 sequestration location in Mississippi, expanding its storage portfolio that already includes sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. Denbury intends to drill a stratigraphic test well on the site in 2023 to support the Company’s geologic interpretation and progress Class VI permitting with the EPA.Nik Wood, Denbury’s Senior Vice President, CCUS, commented, ""Our agreement with Weyerhaeuser is a significant step in building out the Gulf Coast’s leading CO2 transportation and sequestration network. The location of this Mississippi site, directly adjacent to our existing pipeline network, provides for a very efficient development and increases the overall flexibility and capacity of our operations. We now have the pathways to move industrial-sourced CO2 from the Mississippi River Industrial corridor north on our NEJD pipeline, west on our Green Pipeline, and east to our previously announced planned storage in southeast Louisiana. We look forward to working with Weyerhaeuser as we develop the safest, most reliable and efficient CO2 transportation and storage system in the Gulf Coast.""Story continuesThe lease agreement demonstrates Weyerhaeuser’s continued progress on its previously announced plan to grow its Natural Climate Solutions business, including through carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), forest carbon offsets, renewable energy development, mitigation solutions and conservation. Weyerhaeuser has identified multiple locations for potential sequestration projects across a portion of its 7-million-acre footprint in the U.S. South using proprietary geological data covering its lands.Russell Hagen, Weyerhaeuser’s Senior Vice President and Chief Development Officer, commented, ""This agreement represents another important milestone in the growth of our CCS business, and it supports our broader commitment to sustainability and providing natural climate solutions across our land base. We are excited to partner on this project with Denbury and unlock the option value created when combining our uniquely positioned acreage and subsurface ownership with high-quality developers of CCS projects in the Gulf South.""ABOUT DENBURYDenbury is an independent energy company with operations and assets focused on Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

With impressive revenue and earnings per share figures in its latest earnings results, as well as a great outlook, this could be an overlooked value stock thanks to operating in the unattractive waste management business.The company is also still growing; for example, it recently acquired a controlling interest in the U.S. operations of another waste management company, Avangard Innovative. The company has plans to expand its renewable natural gas operations as part of its strategy for finding success in an ever-growing global waste management market. The effort to produce more natural gas from its waste sites has led more investors to take notice of Waste Management's potential, which could provide a catalyst in the future.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with WM. Click here to check it out. WM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WMPeter Lynch Chart of WMShareholder friendly approach will help during this bear marketWaste Management is on its way to becoming a dividend aristocrat as it just announced a dividend hike of 7.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The new dividend payment will be $0.70 per share, up from $0.65. With this increase, the annual dividend will be $2.80 per share, which will be the 20th year of dividend increases.Waste Management's free cash flow is very healthy and is the reason behind its constant dividend hikes. In 2022 alone, the company paid more than $540 million in dividends. However, the dividend payout ratio is 0.47 as of this writing. That gives the company plenty of opportunities to keep growing the dividend without jeopardizing its cash flow.The company bought back $520 million in shares in the year's first half. The company also announced that another share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion had been authorized by its board. The previous buyback program of $1.5 billion wrapped up earlier in the year.Story continuesWaste Management continues to perform wellIn the third quarter of 2022, revenue and earnings per share were remarkable and better than the results of the same period last year. The revenue generated was a tremendous $5.08 billion, increasing 8.8% from the year-ago period. The collection and disposal yield was 7.1%. Meanwhile, the earnings per share reported was $1.55, up from $1.28 announced in the third quarter of 2021 and exceeding estimates by 2.5%.The quarter's net income rose 19% to $639 million, and the profit margin was 13%. The management highlighted the adjusted operating Ebitda of $1.45 billion and the growth of 11% that was owed to the growth in organic revenue, the company's effort to reduce costs and the automation of business operations.During the quarter, free cash flow decreased versus last year, and capital expenditures increased year-over-year. The reason is that the company made strategic sustainability growth investments and increased capital spending to expand the business. The company also spent $541 million on repurchasing shares and returned $267 million to shareholders in dividends.One driver of revenue and shareholder returns was the increase in core price. In the quarter, the core price was 8.2%, up 70 basis points from the second quarter and coming in higher than the 4.6% core price of the third quarter of 2021. The management believes it can retain price hikes as the increase is nominal compared to the clients' expenses and because it would be arduous for customers to change to another company. There aren't exactly many options in the waste management industry.The portfolio is expandingIn the third quarter, the company spent $200 million on acquisitions, bringing it closer to its goal of investing $300 million to $400 million through acquisitions in 2022. The company also announced that it would acquire a controlling interest in the U.S. business of Avangard Innovative, through which the corporation's plastic recycling operations will improve the commercial usage of films and clear plastic wrap. According to the management's comments, the investment returns of this acquisition will be similar to the recycling automation investments and will be recognized over time.The company's leader status in the recycling world has been achieved through multiple acquisitions, as it has made 88 related acquisitions in the past five years. Out of all of these, purchasing Advanced Disposal was an important milestone that expanded the customer base to 3 million new commercial, industrial and residential customers in 16 U.S. states.The waste management industry will grow exponentially with timeThe global waste management market is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.1% from 2021 to 2026, rising from $423.4 billion to $542.7 billion, according to Markets and Markets research. Waste Management will likely occupy a good chunk of the market due to its dominant industry position.Furthermore, the company is investing heavily in expanding its renewable natural gas infrastructure. The company plans on shelling out $825 million through 2025 to erect 17 new renewable natural gas-generating landfills. It already has the landfills, so it might as well make money from them.TakeawayThe company is working on staying at the top of the industry through innovation as well as acquisitions. It is making sure to prioritize its shareholders with dividends and share buybacks. All of this combined makes Waste Management a strong overlooked value opportunity in my opinion.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale. Thus selling at an average price of US$518, which is higher than the current price, may have been the best decision.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Intuit Intuit Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP and Chief People &amp; Places Officer, Laura Fennell, sold US$9.1m worth of shares at a price of US$611 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$411. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Intuit insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Intuit Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Intuit. In total, SVP &amp; Chief Accounting Officer Lauren Hotz sold US$61k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of IntuitMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Intuit insiders own about US$3.2b worth of shares (which is 2.8% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Intuit Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Intuit stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

It added it was aiming for certification in 2029.Supersonic Concorde-style flights have drawn interest from major carriers United Airlines and American Airlines, but Boom's push to be among the first to roll out such a plane suffered a setback earlier this year when Rolls-Royce pulled out and other leading suppliers opted not to fill the gap.General Electric, Safran and Honeywell International Inc have all said they have no plans to develop civil supersonic engines for the time being.That left Boom scouting for new partners to help shoulder heavy investments needed to launch a new jet and engine. The firm has raised $319 million as of October 2021 and was valued at $1.2 billion, according to PitchBook Data.Boom Chief Executive Officer Blake Scholl told Reuters on Monday the company was ""well-funded"", but did not disclose specific details.Scholl said Boom decided to take the lead on developing its own engines after looking at ""limitations"" of adapting a subsonic engine and the ""traditional engine business model.""DESIGN PARTNERUnder the new deal, Kratos unit Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT) will design the engine and build some of the first units.Kratos currently supplies small, high-performance jet engines for cruise missiles and drones, according to its website. Boom said FTT's engineers have also worked on advanced U.S. supersonic fighter engines.Story continuesCivil engine makers invest billions of dollars, which they recoup over the lifetime of engines through aftermarket sales.Although barriers to entry are falling in high-tech sectors such as space, analysts say it remains a significant challenge to keep up with the billions of dollars and certification hurdles required to develop a new engine for passenger use.Raytheon Technologies unit Pratt &amp; Whitney is estimated to have spent $10 billion to develop its latest engine to re-enter the civil market after a gap of several years.China remains in the early stages of challenging Western engine manufacturers with its own alternative engine portfolio.Boom will hold the intellectual property rights for the engine and will lead the program, Scholl said.The company also said 3D-printed-components expert GE Additive will be a supplier to the engine program and maintenance firm StandardAero will also be a partner.(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips, Tim Hepher and Anil D'Silva)]"

It is worth noting that the first two out of the four units have been delivered and have passed the trial period. Those two units are now connected to the grid.The pumped storage units will act as big batteries for the power plant. When there is excess energy, water will be pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir. On the other hand, when there is demand, water will be released from the upper chambers thus producing electricity as the water passes through the turbines. This process will help the Anhui province to minimize its grid stability problems.The 1.2 GW project will help China to meet its goal of developing more than 200 pumped storage stations with a capacity of 270 gigawatts by 2025. Annually the project is capable of generating a capacity of about 1.4 times the household electricity consumption in Jinzhai.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company’s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on UnitedHealth Group's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:24% = US$20b ÷ US$83b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 24% ROEFirst thing first, we like that UnitedHealth Group has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, UnitedHealth Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 12% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that UnitedHealth Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 16% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is UNH fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is UnitedHealth Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?UnitedHealth Group has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 30% (or a retention ratio of 70%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, UnitedHealth Group has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 27%. As a result, UnitedHealth Group's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 28% for future ROE.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that UnitedHealth Group's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate.

If you want to explore similar ETFs, you can take a look at 5 Best Performing Healthcare ETFs in 2022.2022 has been riddled with volatility, inflation, interest rates, and panicky investors. Investors' focus has shifted from cyclical and growth sectors towards defensive and value sectors amid substantially high CPI prints, an aggressive Fed, and a turbulent market. Equities have had a tough year but have recently started to see a bounce-back, after a weak CPI print was reported for October. As of December 9, the S&amp;P has shed 18% of its value year to date, the Nasdaq has dipped 30.5% since the beginning of 2022, and the Dow is down 8.50% for the year.Investors are finding refuge in consumer defensive sectors, and particularly healthcare. On December 10, Strategas head of technical analysis, Chris Verrone, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed why he thinks healthcare will be a leading sector in 2023. Healthcare is one of Chris Verrone's ""Top Ideas"" as we head into the next year. The analyst noted that though ""pharmaceuticals has been a dead industry for the better part of the last 5 or 6 years"" the pharmaceutical stocks have started to ""break out"". Verrone said that ""we have seen leadership really coming from the likes of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY)"" and that he sees healthcare as a leading sector into 2023 and it is a ""theme worth playing"".While the sell offs in equities have shaken up investor confidence, investors can still work around gaining exposure to the much-anticipated leading sector in a less risky way. Investing in healthcare ETFs (exchange-traded funds) over healthcare stocks is a great way to gain exposure to the healthcare sector without having to pick and choose individual stocks. Healthcare ETFs can offer a diversified portfolio of healthcare companies, allowing investors to spread their risk across a range of different healthcare stocks. Healthcare ETFs are also generally more liquid than individual stocks, meaning that investors can enter or exit the market quickly and easily. This is beneficial for investors who don’t have a long-term investment horizon and are looking to take advantage of short-term market movements.Story continuesOverall, investing in healthcare ETFs over healthcare stocks is a great way for risk-averse investors to gain exposure to some of the best-in-class names in the healthcare sector, which include Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

In 2019, BMY acquired Celgene, who had one of the better corporate development programs in the industry. We view this as a great outlet for us as generalists considering a company like BMY should truly thrive with the ability to acquire outstanding assets and science at depressed valuations. We touched on the Turning Point acquisition above and we expect the company to be increasingly active in the M&amp;A landscape. Importantly, Celgene also came to BMY with a phenomenal CAR-T platform.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the healthcare sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Defensive Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy. People invest in dividend stocks for several reasons. One reason is that these stocks can provide a regular source of income in the form of dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders. This can be especially appealing to investors who are looking for a way to generate a steady stream of income from their investments. Additionally, dividend stocks may be seen as a safer investment compared to other types of stocks, since companies that pay dividends are often more established and financially stable. This can provide investors with some peace of mind, knowing that their investment is less likely to be impacted by market volatility or other factors. Finally, many investors view dividend stocks as a good long-term investment, since they can provide both income and the potential for capital appreciation over time. Defensive stocks are those that hold up well during periods of economic downturns. The healthcare sector is considered one of the most reliable defensive industries because these companies benefit from growing consumer demand regardless of the overall economy.The onset of the pandemic of 2020 has shifted the dynamics of the global healthcare system. The healthcare industry in the US is the biggest in the world, which accounted for over 17% of the national GDP in 2020, according to a report by Insider Intelligence. The report also referred to the data by Deloitte and mentioned that health spending in the US will reach $8.3 trillion by 2040, up from $4 trillion in 2020.Over the years, the healthcare industry has generated solid revenues in the US. CNBC cited data from McKinsey &amp; Company and mentioned that the sector’s earnings are projected to grow 6% annually from 2021 through 2025, producing an additional $31 billion in profits. The same report mentioned that various healthcare companies in the US have given positive growth outlooks for the next few years. This year’s economic chaos also couldn’t target the sector as harshly as other industries. The S&amp;P 500 Health Care index is down by 2.36% year-to-date, versus a 17.97% decline in the broader market, as of December 12. The index gained 9.6% in October, recording its best month since April 2020, as reported by Bloomberg. Another report by AllianceBernstein stated that healthcare stocks have significantly outperformed in down markets from 2000 through June 2022.Story continuesThe solid performance of healthcare stocks can also be attributed to the fact that many health companies are dividend payers. Historically, dividend stocks have proved their mettle in periods of an economic clampdown. Companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) gained investors’ attention due to their strong dividend growth track records and solid returns this year.

Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”6.

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

Griffin, Citadel’s founder and CEO (“KG”) regarding the same.  The agreements will be effective subject to the receipt of certain third-party approvals, likely to be received within the next 35 days.Vornado’s 350 Park Avenue office building, encompassing 585,000 square feet, will be master leased to Citadel on an “as is” basis for 10 years. The initial annual net rent for the property is $36 million, retroactive to Jun 15, 2022.Rudin’s 40 East 52nd Street, spanning 390,000 square feet, will also be master leased to Citadel. This property is adjacent to 350 Park Avenue.Additionally, Vornado entered a joint venture (JV) with Rudin (“Vornado/Rudin”) to purchase 39 East 51st Street for $40 million. VNO intends to combine this property with 350 Park Avenue and 40 East 52nd Street to create a premier development site, to be known as “Site” collectively.Vornado’s plans will materialize only if KG chooses to form a JV with Vornado and Rudin from October 2024 to June 2030. KG will then acquire a 60% interest in the JV that will value the Site at $1.2 billion ($900 million to Vornado and $300 million to Rudin).

This will be nullified if the put option is exercised in response to KG’s request to form the JV or if it makes a $200 million termination payment.Vornado experienced healthy leasing activity across its portfolio in third-quarter 2022. However, the United States office real estate market has been choppy for quite some time now, with negative absorption and increasing vacancy levels. The continuation of the flexible working environment and pandemic-led job cuts have led to diminishing office space utilization.Even with many companies implementing a return-to-office policy, any significant turnaround is less likely in the near term.Shares of Vornado, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, have lost 17.6% in the past three months compared with its industry’s decline of 8.8%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, Lamar Advertising LAMR and Chatham Lodging Trust REIT CLDT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The New York-based carrier announced on December 7 it’s expanding its elite Mosaic programs and creating a level of mileage accumulation named tiles that enables customers to obtain perks before reaching mosaic levels of flying.However, loyalty program experts question whether JetBlue’s first updates to True Blue in 10 years have made it unnecessarily complicated, which they see as part of a trend of airline loyalty programs becoming more complex.“With the exception of Southwest, all of these programs suffer from extreme complexity,” said Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany, which develops marketing for airline loyalty programs. “The model for the big three airlines [American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines] has been we’re going to throw an array of stuff at our members and hope that some of it will be of interest to them.”Sorensen added that having four elite Mosaic tiers, instead of one, seems excessive. “True Blue had a very simple premise, and now it’s very complex.”Travel columnist Joe Brancatelli seconds Sorensen’s belief about True Blue becoming more confusing. “JetBlue didn’t knock your socks off with the announcement,” he said.But JetBlue spokesperson Philip Stewart refuted notions that the carrier made True Blue too complex. “In designing the program, we actually took many steps to try and make it simple,” Stewart said about the changes scheduled to take effect in spring 2023.“We think creating a separately named tracking system for status [tiles] will much more easily allow customer to differentiate between that and True Blue points, rather than trying to figure out Mosaic qualifying points versus True Blue points.”True Blue accumulation will be for total spending — not just for JetBlue flights and travel bookings. That follows the example of American Airlines, which broadened its program in March so that all credit card spending is recognized by the same methodology as flying. Airlines are increasingly making their loyalty programs receptive to non-airline spending.Story continues“Now, our True Blue members will be able to combine the tiles they earn from card spend with the tiles they earn from flight spend,” Stewart said, adding that JetBlue will be better able to further take full advantage of its Northeast Alliance with American Airlines and acquisition of Spirit Airlines.True Blue members will earn one tile for every $100 in spending on airline related-costs, including American Airlines spending. Members will also earn one tile for every $1,000 in spending on JetBlue credit cards. Tiles will not only determine progress toward Mosaic status, but also will enable access to selected perks, including access to security screening, an in-flight alcoholic screening and double points for booking a vacation package.“Airlines are adapting their loyalty programs to the new realities of travel, and so are we,” Stewart said. “We’re opening up rewards to even infrequent travelers and in adding more levels of mosaic and additional ways to qualify, we’re adding more benefits and more personalization and choice.”Although Brancatelli raised concerns about JetBlue’s loyalty program strategy regarding its merger with Spirit, noting that Spirit’s program Free Spirit is very different from True Blue, he nonetheless issued support for True Blue’s overdue updates.“JetBlue is providing more choice at the elite level and recognizing more spending with a better integration of credit card spend into the program,” Brancatelli said. “That recognizes more spending and gives more value to the card.”Likewise, Sorensen applauded some of the changes Jet Blue has made to its loyalty program.“I give them high marks for innovation with tiles. It allows everyday members to enjoy more perks on their path to becoming a highly valued customer. And it allows customers to choose their perk.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

American increased its year-over-year score by more than 20%, a strong recognition of the progress the airline has made toward reaching its environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.The 2022 DJSI comprises North American sustainability leaders as identified by S&amp;P Global through the Corporate Sustainability Assessment. It represents the top 20% of the largest 600 North American companies in the S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index (BMI) based on long-term economic, environmental and social criteria.""Returning to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a second straight year is a tremendous honor,"" American's CEO Robert Isom said. ""We know there's still a great deal of work to do, but I'm proud of the strides our entire team has made over the past year. As we continue to build American to thrive forever, we will keep holding ourselves to this high standard of aviation industry leadership.""In 2022, American became the first airline in history to receive a CORSIA-certified batch of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and furthered its commitment to SAF usage by announcing a new agreement to purchase an additional 500 million gallons over five years from Gevo, Inc., an important step in reaching the airline's goal to replace 10% of its jet fuel with SAF by 2030. As part of its commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, American also became the first U.S. airline to make two direct investments focused on the development of both hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and the future of hydrogen distribution logistics.American was also recognized for its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. The airline has received high scores from leading benchmark organizations including a top score of 100 from the Disability Equality Index; the highest possible rating of 100 from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, which named American a 2022 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality; and recognition from the Seramount Inclusion Index for the fifth straight year for the airline's efforts to create an inclusive workplace.Story continuesIn addition, the DJSI noted American's continued efforts to advance its ESG goals while maintaining the highest standards of safety. Last year, the airline successfully mitigated 100% of identified safety risks and hazardous situations for mainline flights. The achievement comes during a year in which American operated the largest flight schedule of any U.S. carrier.The full results and list of Index constituents are available online.American released its latest ESG Report in July, which details the progress the company made on key ESG priorities in 2021 and provides the airline's updated analysis of its path to net-zero emissions by 2050.More information on American's approach to ESG is available at aa.com/esg, and details on the airline's sustainability strategy are available at aa.com/sustainability.About American Airlines GroupTo Care for People on Life's Journey®.

376,bdd03dc7-10b8-30a5-939b-7f231055d335,ORLY,2022-12-13,4 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio to Snap Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-impressive-interest-coverage-141102620.html,1670854262,STORY,"['GILD', 'SFM', 'ORLY', 'FTNT']","[Investors seem to be nervous and are treading Wall Street with utmost caution as worries about a possible recession loom large. Experts fear that the Fed’s hawkish stance to tame inflation might push the economy into a recession. However, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent comment about lowering the magnitude of the rate hike from December has come as a breather. Meanwhile, a favorable reading on the Consumer Price Index front as well as a better-than-expected jobs report in November adds to the positive sentiment.Given the current scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. You can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM, Fortinet, Inc. FTNT, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY and Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesWhat’s the Strategy?Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four picks out of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Sprouts Farmers, which offers fresh, natural, and organic food products in the United States, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. Its expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 10.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers’ current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 4.6% and 11%, respectively, from the year-ago period. SFM has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10%, on average. The stock has rallied 23% in the past year.Fortinet, a global leader in broad, integrated and automated cybersecurity solutions, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced positive first data from a cohort of a pivotal Phase 2 trial evaluating investigational odronextamab in patients with heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL) grades 1 to 3a. The data were presented in an oral session at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in New Orleans, LA, and follow the first Phase 2 results for odronextamab in R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from the same trial that were presented yesterday. The results will form the basis of planned submissions to regulatory authorities in 2023, including to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Odronextamab is an investigational CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody designed to bridge CD20 on cancer cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.""There is high unmet need for follicular lymphoma treatments that can improve tumor control and extend survival, given that there is no cure for this cancer and patients will experience multiple relapses,"" said Tae Min Kim, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital in Seoul, South Korea, and a trial investigator. ""These positive pivotal Phase 2 results investigating odronextamab in heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma patients showed deep and durable response – confirming earlier findings in this program – with the highest complete response rates seen in this patient population to date. We look forward to seeing the data continue to mature.""Story continuesAt ASH, efficacy in R/R FL was presented from 121 patients enrolled in a Phase 2 trial cohort (median follow-up: 22 months, range: 3-33 months). All patients had received at least two prior therapies, including a CD20 antibody and alkylating agent. Patients were treated with a step-up regimen of odronextamab in the first cycle to help mitigate the risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) before receiving the full dose of 80 mg. The step-up regimen was modified part way through the trial to further mitigate CRS. Results as assessed by independent central review were as follows:82% objective response rate (ORR), with 75% achieving a complete response (CR). The median duration of complete response (mDOCR) was 20.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17 months to not evaluable [NE]).Median progression-free survival was 20 months (PFS; 95% CI: 15 months to NE).Median overall survival (OS) not reached (95% CI: NE to NE).Among 131 patients assessed for safety, adverse events (AE) occurred in all patients, with 78% being ≥Grade 3. The most common AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients were CRS (56.5%), neutropenia (40%), pyrexia (31%), anemia (30%), infusion-related reaction (29%), arthralgia (21%), diarrhea (21%) and thrombocytopenia (20%). Discontinuations due to an AE occurred in 11.5% of patients, and there were 3 deaths due to pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and systemic mycosis where the relationship to odronextamab treatment could not be excluded.CRS was the most common AE, of which 68% of cases were mild (Grade 1) and all resolved within a median of 2 days (range: 1-51 days). There were no Grade 4 or 5 CRS cases, and the incidence of both Grade 2 and Grade 3 was reduced with the modified step-up regimen when compared to the original regimen (original regimen n=68 vs. step-up regimen n=63; Grade 2: 18% vs. 11%, Grade 3: 6% vs. 2%).Based on these data, the OLYMPIA Phase 3 development program investigating odronextamab is in the process of being initiated. In the U.S., odronextamab has been granted Fast Track Designation for FL by the FDA. In the European Union, Orphan Drug Designation was granted for FL by the European Medicines Agency. Odronextamab is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Investor Webcast InformationRegeneron will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to share updates on the company's hematology portfolio on Wednesday, December 14 at 8:30 AM ET.

The primary endpoint is ORR according to the Lugano Classification, and secondary endpoints include CR, PFS, OS, duration of response, disease control rate, safety and quality of life.ELM-1 is an ongoing, open-label, multicenter Phase 1 trial to investigate the safety and tolerability of odronextamab in patients with CD20+ B-cell malignancies previously treated with CD20-directed antibody therapy. Subcutaneous administration is being evaluated in two disease specific cohorts.About Follicular Lymphoma (FL) One of the most common subtypes of B-NHL, FL is a slow-growing (indolent) form of B-NHL with most cases diagnosed in advanced stages. Although median survival ranges from 8 to 15 years in advanced FL, current therapeutic options are not curative, and most patients relapse within five years regardless of the regimen.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced positive initial data from a pivotal Phase 2 expansion cohort evaluating investigational linvoseltamab (formerly REGN5458) at the 200 mg dose recommended for further development in patients with heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma. The results were part of a broader presentation of new and updated data from a Phase 1/2 trial and were shared at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in New Orleans, LA. Linvoseltamab is an investigational bispecific antibody designed to bridge B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on multiple myeloma cells with CD3-expressing T cells to facilitate local T-cell activation and cancer-cell killing.""The need for innovative medicines is critical for patients with multiple myeloma who inevitably face a downward spiral of relapses, reduced responses to subsequent therapies, and increasingly shorter remissions,"" said Naresh Bumma, M.D., Hematologist and Assistant Professor in the Division of Hematology at Ohio State University, and a trial investigator. ""At the recommended 200 mg dose in a pivotal Phase 2 trial, linvoseltamab demonstrated early, deep and durable responses in patients living with multiple myeloma who had been on at least three prior therapies, including those with higher risk and high disease burden. These clinically meaningful outcomes at 12 weeks reinforce the positive linvoseltamab results seen in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion, and we look forward to seeing data from more patients and longer follow-up.""Story continuesAs presented at ASH, out of 252 patients treated in the Phase 1/2 trial, 81% of patients were triple-refractory to existing therapeutic options, including an immunomodulatory drug, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody. Additionally, 37% had bone marrow plasma cells ≥50%, and the median soluble BCMA was 0.43 mg/L, representing a patient population with a higher disease burden than those enrolled in similar trials. Of the 87 patients in the 200 mg cohort, 58 were evaluated for efficacy. With a median follow-up of 3 months (range: 0 to 30 months), efficacy results were as follows:64% objective response rate (ORR), with 45% achieving a very good partial response or better, as determined by an independent review committee. Based on earlier results, responses may increase with longer follow-up.Median time to response was &lt;1 month (range: &lt;1 to 5 months).79% probability of maintaining a response at 6 months (95% confidence interval: 50% to 92%), per Kaplan-Meier estimates.Among the 87 patients treated in the 200 mg cohort assessed for safety, adverse events (AEs) occurred in 95% of patients, with 66% being ≥Grade 3. The most common AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 37%), fatigue (32%), anemia (28%), diarrhea, cough, headache (23% each) and neutropenia (20%). Discontinuations due to an AE occurred in 6% of patients. When CRS occurred, in 32 out of 87 patients, 23 of those patients experienced Grade 1, 8 experienced Grade 2, there was 1 transient Grade 3 case, and none were ≥Grade 4.Among the overall patient population across different dose levels (n=252), the median time to first CRS onset was 11 hours (range: 0-47 hours) and all cases resolved, with a median time to resolution of 15 hours (range: 0-377 hours). Deaths due to AEs in the overall population were reported in 14 patients, including sepsis/bacterial infection (n=6), COVID-19 (n=4) or other causes (n=4). None of the deaths were considered related to treatment per the treating physician.Linvoseltamab is currently under clinical development and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Investor Webcast InformationRegeneron will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast to share updates on the company's hematology portfolio on Wednesday, December 14 at 8:30 AM ET.

Among the 252 patients enrolled, all have received at least three prior lines of therapy or are double refractory. Patients were administered linvoseltamab via a step-up dosing strategy designed to mitigate CRS.The Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, which is now complete, primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities of linvoseltamab and was comprised of 9 dose-levels. The fully-enrolled Phase 2 dose expansion portion of the trial is further assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary objective of ORR. Key secondary objectives include duration of response, progression free survival, rate of minimal residual disease negative status and overall survival.About Multiple MyelomaMultiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer with approximately 34,470 and 176,404 new diagnoses in the U.S. and the world, respectively, in 2022. It is characterized by the proliferation of cancerous plasma cells (multiple myeloma cells) that crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, infiltrate other tissues and cause potentially life-threatening organ injury. Multiple myeloma is not curable despite treatment advances, and while current treatments are able to slow the progression of the cancer, most patients will ultimately experience cancer progression and require additional therapies. In addition, patients are at increased risk of frequent infections, bone problems, reduced kidney function and anemia.About Regeneron in HematologyAt Regeneron, we're applying more than three decades of biology expertise with our proprietary VelociSuite® technologies to develop medicines for patients with diverse blood cancers and rare blood disorders.Our blood cancer research is focused on bispecific antibodies that are being investigated both as monotherapies and in combination with each other and emerging therapeutic modalities.

384,114614a0-c182-3453-9c3b-292ba451ea80,REGN,2022-12-13,"A Look At The Fair Value Of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-140112942.html,1670853672,STORY,['REGN'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.14bUS$4.36bUS$3.97bUS$4.05bUS$4.02bUS$4.03bUS$4.06bUS$4.11bUS$4.16bUS$4.23bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.56%Est @ 0.20%Est @ 0.74%Est @ 1.11%Est @ 1.37%Est @ 1.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$29bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$93bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$93b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$49bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$79b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$750, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.829. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Therefore, for this list of biotechnology innovators, I focused exclusively on enterprises that featured strong financial stability. It might not be the prettiest list in terms of upside potential. Given the circumstances, though, you want to think about safety first. With that, below are the top biotech stock picks for 2023.REGNRegeneron Pharmaceuticals$750.06UTHRUnited Therapeutics$280.43VRTXVertex Pharmaceuticals$312.22CORTCorcept Therapeutics$21.38GMABGenmab$45.50NVONovo Nordisk$128.91TECHBio-Techne$80.73InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRegeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)The Regeneron (REGN) website is displayed on a smartphone screen over a blue background.Source: madamF / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Westchester County, New York, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) originally focused on neurotrophic factors and their regenerative capabilities, giving rise to its name, according to its public profile on Google Finance. From there, the company branched out into the study of both cytokine and tyrosine kinase receptors.At the time of writing, Regeneron commands a market capitalization of $83.4 billion. On a year-to-date basis, REGN gained 22% of its equity value. Further, in the trailing half-year period, shares stormed higher to the tune of 33%. Much of this enthusiasm centers on the fundamentals. For instance, in September, Regeneron posted positive late-stage clinical results for its key eye medication Eylea.Story continuesOn the financial front, the company will likely draw attention because of its profitability metrics. For instance, its net margin stands at 39.2%, beating out over 94% of the competition. As well, the market prices REGN at only 18.2 times forward earnings. In contrast, the sector median value is 28 times, representing solid value. Therefore, REGN is one of the top biotech stock picks for 2023.United Therapeutics (UTHR)An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around itSource: ra2 studio/ShutterstockA somewhat overlooked name among top biotech stocks for 2023, United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR) will almost certainly attract new investors in the coming months. On paper, United develops novel, life-extending technologies for patients in the areas of lung disease and organ manufacturing. Currently, the company carries a market cap of $12.8 billion.Since the start of the year, UTHR delivered a blistering return of nearly 33%. For context, the underlying Nasdaq Composite index dropped 30% during the same period. Further, most of this upswing came recently. In the trailing half-year period, UTHR popped up almost 27%. Again, the main catalysts focus on fundamental performance. Recently, United posted third-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ expectations.To be 100% transparent, Gurufoucs.com warns that UTHR is significantly overvalued. However, the market prices shares at 14.5 times forward earnings. Again, that’s considerably lower than the sector median of 28 times. Also, United features a return on equity of 17%, ranking higher than over 92% of the industry.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)Illustration of a biopharma company. Doctor standing in front of various medical icons.Source: Billion Photos / ShutterstockHeadquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) came to fame because it represented one of the first biotech firms to use an explicit strategy of rational drug design rather than combinatorial chemistry. Currently, the company invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. These conditions include chronic pain, sickle cell disease, and muscular dystrophy.As with United Therapeutics, Vertex ranks among the top-performing biotech stock picks for 2023. Since the January opener, VRTX gained over 44% of its equity value. It’s been on the move recently, with shares rising nearly 24% during the trailing half-year period. Notably, the company’s Q3 results came in above expectations. As well, management raised its sales outlook for 2022.On the financial front, Vertex will likely attract investors because of its income-statement-related performance metrics. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 35.3%, beating out 78% of its rivals. Its net margin of 37.6% ranks better than nearly 94% of industry players.Corcept Therapeutics (CORT)Brown glass pill bottle on its side showing white pills inside, with other pill bottles behind it representing MACK stock.Source: shutterstock.com/ChampheiMoving into the riskier segment of biotech stock picks for 2023, Corcept Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CORT) is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of severe metabolic, psychiatric and oncologic disorders. Specifically, per its public profile, Corcept has focused on the adverse effects of excess cortisol, studying new compounds that may mitigate those effects.Since the start of this year, CORT returned slightly over 13% of its equity value. So far, so good. However, in the trailing month, shares slipped over 6%. And in the trailing five sessions, CORT finds itself down over 7%. Contributing to the volatility is Corcept’s Q3 earnings report. While the company beat earnings estimates, it fell short on revenue.For contrarians, CORT may represent a discounted opportunity. Per Gurufocus.com and its proprietary calculations for fair market value (FMV), CORT rates as modestly undervalued. However, the star of the show centers on fiscal stability. Corcept features a strong cash position and an Altman Z-Score of 28.54, reflecting extremely low bankruptcy risk. Thus, it’s worth consideration for top biotech stock picks for 2023.Genmab (GMAB)MNMD stock: A scientist holding a test tube in a stock imageSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, Genmab (NASDAQ:GMAB) features six approved antibodies used in six market products. These cover cancer indications and autoimmune diseases. In addition, Genmab conducts research and development for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. At the moment, the company commands a market cap of $29.9 billion.Representing another solid idea among biotech stock picks for 2023, GMAB returned 15.5% for shareholders since the January opener. Most of this upside performance came in the second half of 2022. In the trailing six months, Genmab shares gained a staggering 54% of market value. It’s still going strong, with its trailing one-month performance pinging at 11% up.For the fundamental investors, Genmab is all about the income statement. Its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 38.1%, above 79% of competitors. Further, its net margin is 47%, ranked within the biotech sector’s top 5%. Finally, Genmab enjoys fiscal stability, particularly with its strong cash position. Thus, it’s one of the top biotech stock picks for 2023.Novo Nordisk (NVO)Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA StockSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.comAnother Danish entry among biotech stock picks for 2023, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products and services, specifically diabetes care medications and devices. In addition, the company specializes in hemostasis management, growth hormone therapy, and hormone replacement therapy. Presently, Novo carries a market cap of $222.5 billion, a massive stalwart.Although NVO has been choppy throughout much of this year, investors are starting to come around to the opportunity. Since the beginning of the year, NVO gained over 17% of its equity value. However, in the trailing month, shares returned stakeholders 12%. Again, positive fundamental data contributed to the enthusiasm. Novo reported a Q3 net profit that beat expectations. Moreover, management raised the enterprise’s full-year guidance.Financially, Gurufocus.com warns that NVO is significantly overvalued. However, prospective investors should also note that Novo features an ROE of 74.5%, a staggering figure. It also ranks within the top 2% of the industry. As well, Novo enjoys fiscal stability, with an Altman Z-Score of 9.28 reflecting very low bankruptcy risk.Bio-Techne (TECH)Medical technology network team meeting concept. Doctor hand working smart phone modern digital tablet laptop computer graphics chart interface, sun flare effect photo, PTESource: everything possible / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the riskiest entry on this list of biotech stock picks for 2023, Bio-Techne (NASDAQ:TECH) calls Minneapolis, Minnesota home. The company develops, manufactures, and sells life science reagents, instruments, and services for the research, diagnostic, and bioprocessing markets. Essentially, it’s a stagehand manager, critically helping to keep the show running.At the moment, Bio-Techne commands a market cap of $12.9 billion. However, the real issue is its YTD market performance. Since the January opener, TECH hemorrhaged nearly 33% of its equity value. Further, the near-term performance isn’t that great. For instance, in the trailing half-year period, shares dipped almost 8%. Still, they did gain 5% in the trailing month.Despite the red ink in the market, it’s possible that contrarians might view TECH as a discounted play. Per Gurufocus.com’s FMV calculations, Bio-Techne is modestly undervalued. In addition, the biotech company features very solid figures for revenue growth and operating/net margins. On a final note, Bio-Techne’s Altman Z-Score is 14.54, reflecting a very low bankruptcy risk.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to see more best dividend paying stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now.Dividend paying stocks are stocks of companies that pay dividends to their shareholders. Companies pay dividends to their shareholders as a way to return profits back to the owners. Although not always the case, many dividend paying stocks pay dividends on a quarterly basis.Given profits can go up and down depending on various factors, dividends can fluctuate over time. During recessions, some companies cut their dividends as a way to strengthen their balance sheet. During more expansionary times, company profits can grow and many companies increase their dividends as a result.While dividends can fluctuate, the best dividend paying stocks tend to have a more stable dividend payment history given the strength of their businesses. Because many of the best dividend paying stocks are blue chip companies with substantial scale and competitive advantages, the companies are often able to keep or even raise their dividend payments in tough economic times.As a result, many of the best dividend paying stocks have raised their annual dividends for many consecutive years.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times this year alone to fight inflation.Although inflation has shown signs of potentially peaking in October, many analysts think the U.S. central bank will raise rates further. If rates go up too far, there's a potential for a recession next year and some companies might decrease their dividends as a result.With the higher interest rates, Treasury yields have increased and the higher U.S. government bond yields have made dividend yielding stocks less attractive to some investors. Given the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Story continuesNevertheless, the decrease in stock prices have made the valuations of some quality dividend paying blue chip companies more attractive. Although there could be more downside in the near term if economic data fails to meet expectations, some of the quality blue chip companies could do well in the long term given their strong businesses.New York Wall Street sign.MethodologyFor our list of 12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 12 blue chip stocks that paid dividends that also had competitive advantages and growth potential.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.12 Best Dividend Paying Stocks to Buy Now12.

389,6a30386f-8cde-3df0-8acc-75b735fb08b1,UNP,2022-12-13,The Returns At Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Aren't Growing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-union-pacific-nyse-unp-140132859.html,1670853692,STORY,['UNP'],"[If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Union Pacific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.17 = US$10b ÷ (US$65b - US$5.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, Union Pacific has an ROCE of 17%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 15% generated by the Transportation industry. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific roceIn the above chart we have measured Union Pacific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Union Pacific.So How Is Union Pacific's ROCE Trending?Things have been pretty stable at Union Pacific, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. With that in mind, unless investment picks up again in the future, we wouldn't expect Union Pacific to be a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Union Pacific is paying out 42% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn a nutshell, Union Pacific has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 76% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Union Pacific and understanding it should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?
