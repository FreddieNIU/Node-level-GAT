Fewer than 20% of Schwab’s depositors exceed the FDIC’s $250,000 insurance cap, compared with about 90% at SVB. And with 34 million accounts, a phalanx of financial advisers and more than $7 trillion of assets across all of its businesses, it towers over regional institutions.Yet the questions around Schwab won’t go away.Rather, as the crisis drags on, investors are starting to unearth risks that have been hiding in plain sight. Unrealized losses on the Westlake, Texas-based firm’s balance sheet, loaded with long-dated bonds, ballooned to more than $29 billion last year. At the same time, higher interest rates are encouraging customers to move their cash out of certain accounts that underpin Schwab’s business and bolster its bottom line.It’s another indication that the Federal Reserve’s rapid policy tightening caught the financial world flat-footed after decades of declining rates. Schwab shares have lost more than a quarter of their value since March 8, with some Wall Street analysts expecting earnings to suffer.“In hindsight, they arguably could have had more prudent investment choices,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Wong.Chief Executive Officer Walt Bettinger and the brokerage’s founder and namesake, billionaire Charles Schwab, have said the firm is healthy and prepared to withstand the broader turmoil.The business is “misunderstood,” and it’s “misleading” to focus on paper losses, which the company may never have to incur, they said last week in a statement.Story continues“There would be a sufficient amount of liquidity right there to cover if 100% of our bank’s deposits ran off,” Bettinger told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday, adding that the firm could borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank and issue certificates of deposit to address any funding shortfall.Through a representative, Bettinger declined to comment for this story. A Schwab spokesperson declined to comment beyond the Thursday statement.The broader crisis showed signs of easing on Monday, after First Citizens BancShares Inc. agreed to buy SVB, buoying shares of financial firms including Schwab, which was up 3.1% at 2:29 p.m. in New York. The stock is still down 42% from its peak in February 2022, a month before the Fed started raising interest rates.Unusual OperationSchwab is unusual among peers. It operates one of the largest US banks, grafted on to the biggest publicly traded brokerage. Both divisions are sensitive to interest-rate fluctuations.Like SVB, Schwab gobbled up longer-dated bonds at low yields in 2020 and 2021. That meant paper losses mounted in a short period as the Fed began boosting rates to stamp out inflation.Three years ago, Schwab’s main bank had no unrealized losses on long-term debt that it planned to hold until maturity. By last March, the firm had more than $5 billion of such paper losses — a figure that climbed to more than $13 billion at year-end.It shifted $189 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities from “available-for-sale” to “held-to-maturity” on its balance sheet last year, a move that effectively shields those unrealized losses from impacting stockholder equity.“They basically saw higher interest rates coming,” Stephen Ryan, an accounting professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said in a phone interview. “They didn’t know how long they would last or how big they would be, but they protected the equity by making the transfer.”The rules governing such balance sheet moves are stringent. It means Schwab plans to hold more than $150 billion worth of debt to maturity with a weighted-average yield of 1.74%. The lion’s share of the securities — $114 billion at the end of 2022 — won’t mature for more than a decade.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield now: 3.5%.Cash BusinessSchwab’s other headache from higher interest rates stems from cash.At the root of Schwab’s income is idle client money. The firm “sweeps” cash deposits from brokerage accounts to its bank, where it can reinvest in higher-yielding products. The difference between what Schwab earns and what it pays out in interest to customers is its net interest income, among the most important metrics for a bank.Net interest income accounted for 51% of Schwab’s total net revenue last year.“Schwab’s counting on inertia,” said Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic, a financial-planning firm.After a year of rapidly rising rates, there’s greater incentive to avoid being stagnant with cash. While many money-market funds are paying more than 4% interest, Schwab’s sweep accounts offer just 0.45%.Though it’s an open question just how much money customers could move away from its sweep vehicles, Schwab’s management acknowledged this behavior picked up last year.“As a result of rapidly increasing short-term interest rates in 2022, the company saw an increase in the pace at which clients moved certain cash balances” into higher-yielding alternatives, Schwab said in its annual report. “As these outflows have continued, they have outpaced excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and pay-downs on our investment portfolios.”In their statement, Bettinger and Schwab wrote that “client deposits may move, but they are not leaving the firm.”FHLB BorrowingTo plug the gap, the brokerage’s banking units borrowed $12.4 billion from the FHLB system through the end of 2022, and had the capacity to borrow $68.6 billion, according to an annual report filed with regulators.Schwab borrowed an additional $13 billion from the FHLB so far this year, the filing showed.Analysts have been weighing these factors, with Barclays Plc and Morningstar lowering their price targets for Schwab shares in recent weeks.Bettinger and Schwab said that the firm’s long history and conservatism will help customers navigate the current cycle, as they have for more than 50 years.“We remain confident in our client-centric approach, the performance of our business, and the long-term stability of our company,” they wrote in last week’s statement. “We are different than other banks.”—With assistance from Silla Brush, Miles Weiss and Noah Buhayar.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeChina Lent Heavily to Developing Nations.

But the bank said the two advisers, Christopher Armstrong and Randall Kiefner, who it fired for violating its transition policy, are still refusing to pay their share.“Morgan Stanley may not agree with the arbitration panel’s award but, unlike Armstrong and Kiefner, will fully honor all of its obligations under the award,” the bank said Friday.Morgan Stanley and Schwab didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. A lawyer who represented Armstrong and Kiefner in the arbitration wasn’t immediately available for comment.Schwab sued Armstrong, Kiefner and Morgan Stanley over the advisers’ March 2019 departures, claiming they stole trade secrets and breached their contracts. After they were fired by Morgan Stanley, the two men turned around and sued the bank for breach of contract and and defamation, among other claims. They said Morgan Stanley told them their actions were legal and promised to cover their costs in any dispute with Schwab.$425 Million BookAccording to Armstrong’s complaint, he once managed $425 million in client assets at Schwab but, by 2018, his book of business was shrinking by $35 million annually as elderly clients died or withdrew money as required by minimum distributions. Armstrong said he and Kiefner, who helped manage Armstrong’s portfolio, began searching for new jobs after his manager at Schwab suggested he look for a less demanding firm.Story continuesMorgan Stanley “duped Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Kiefner into disclosing Schwab’s confidential practice metrics and customer information with a view towards diverting their customers from Schwab,” the advisers alleged.The cases were all sent to arbitration. The panel ordered Morgan Stanley to pay Schwab $3 million in punitive damages. The bank was also found jointly liable with Armstrong and Kiefner to Schwab for $4.3 million in compensatory damages and legal fees.Morgan Stanley was ordered to pay Armstrong about $3 million in damages and legal fees and Kiefner, about $1.5 million.In its Friday filing, Morgan Stanley said it would seek another arbitration hearing to force Armstrong and Kiefner to pay their share of the joint award, which it said amounted to about $1.44 million each.The case is Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC v.

2,8fb4854b-f7cd-30e0-9be3-7496c7f23439,SCHW,2023-03-28,Is Schwab Balanced Fund (SWOBX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-balanced-fund-swobx-strong-110011241.html,1679914811,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[If investors are looking at the Mutual Fund Equity Report fund category, Schwab Balanced Fund (SWOBX) could be a potential option. SWOBX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWOBX. Schwab Balanced Fund debuted in October of 1996. Since then, SWOBX has accumulated assets of about $619.50 million, according to the most recently available information. Zifan Tang is the fund's current manager and has held that role since February of 2012.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. SWOBX has a 5-year annualized total return of 4.72% and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 4.6%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SWOBX's standard deviation over the past three years is 14.64% compared to the category average of 14.71%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 12.8% compared to the category average of 12.68%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsInvestors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 0.67, so it is likely going to be less volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -2.41, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesFor investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWOBX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.50% compared to the category average of 0.86%. So, SWOBX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineOverall, Schwab Balanced Fund ( SWOBX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and lower fees, this fund looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.Want even more information about SWOBX?

3,c4a80a4d-7d44-3b37-b14d-f179fc14eea7,TXN,2023-03-28,"With 86% ownership of the shares, Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/86-ownership-shares-texas-instruments-130015940.html,1679922015,STORY,['TXN'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Texas Instruments' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 22 shareholders Recent sales by insiders If you want to know who really controls Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 86% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Texas Instruments. See our latest analysis for Texas Instruments ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Texas Instruments?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Texas Instruments. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Texas Instruments, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Texas Instruments. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.7%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.5% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.1% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Texas InstrumentsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Texas Instruments Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$200m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 14% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Texas Instruments. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 shouldn't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: SilverBow Resources SBOW, Cheniere Energy LNG and Range Resources RRC.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Natural Gas Prices Witness Another Sharp FallThe U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. Despite the positive inventory numbers, futures dropped more than 5% week over week, overwhelmed by a string of bearish factors.In fact, the market hasn't been kind to natural gas in 2023, with the commodity trading considerably lower year to date and threatening to break below the $2 threshold.While macro challenges are leading to some concerns, we advise investors to focus on stocks like SilverBow Resources and Cheniere Energy.EIA Reports a Withdrawal Marginally Larger Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 72 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Mar 17, just above the guidance of 71 Bcf decline per a survey conducted by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.The decrease was also higher than last year’s pull of 55 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2018-2022) average net shrinkage of 45 Bcf.The latest draw of the winter heating season puts total natural gas stocks at 1,900 Bcf, which is 504 Bcf (36.1%) above the 2022 level at this time and 351 Bcf (22.7%) higher than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 105.7 Bcf per day, down 0.2 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to a slight decrease in dry production.Meanwhile, daily consumption deteriorated 3.7% to 111.4 Bcf from 115.7 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a weaker power burn and lower residential/commercial demand.Story continuesNatural Gas Logs a Weekly LossNatural gas prices trended downward last week, despite the higher-than-expected inventory draw. Futures for April delivery ended Friday at $2.216 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 5.2% from the previous week’s closing. The lower natural gas realization is the result of forecasts for warmer weather and a plentiful supply.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With the latest models anticipating tepid temperature-driven consumption in the near term (with less use of heaters across homes and businesses), prices are likely to be impacted adversely. Compounding the matter, daily production has hovered around the record 100 Bcf mark due to a relatively mild winter, and this has pushed stocks significantly above historical levels.However, a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is also supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been elevated for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere.Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, last year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means that LNG deliveries are poised to remain robust, especially with squeezed natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe, following a shutdown of the Nord Stream pipeline since last August.Meanwhile, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out some of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by a blast in June last year and has only partially restarted after several missed target dates. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Final ThoughtsBased on several factors, the natural gas market is down more than 50% so far this year. As a matter of fact, the space is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for fundamentally strong stocks like Cheniere Energy and SilverBow Resources.SilverBow Resources: SilverBow has operations across roughly 130,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, and more than 80% of its total output comprises natural gas. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s exposure to premium markets and focus on costs and margins should help it to benefit from any increase in natural gas prices.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.SilverBow beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 80.8%. Valued at around $462.3 million, SBOW has lost 39.1% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 187.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter’s 2023 earnings has been revised 8.7% upward over the past 30 days. LNG shares have gained 5.1% in a year.At the same time, investors might want to sell some bottom-ranked stocks like Range Resources.Range Resources: The upstream firm has a strong footing in the prolific Appalachian Basin. In the gas-rich resource, RRC has huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.Range Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of -46.6% for the current year. Valued at around $5.9 billion, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s 2023 earnings have been revised 15.2% downward over the past 30 days.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&amp;P 500.Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.Story continuesThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers. Moreover, these companies also pay out dividends regularly to shareholders, which helps them stay afloat during market downturns. Some companies with solid financials are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which is evident through their decades-long dividend growth histories. In this article, we will discuss the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy.12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Nowmaxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries. These companies are strong dividend payers and have decent yields. We sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data as of Q4 2022.12. Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based diversified manufacturing company that designs various products that belong to the home and automobile industries.

(NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) reported a solid cash position in FY22 as its operating cash flow for the year came in at $441 million, which showed a 63% growth from the same period last year.At the end of Q4 2022, 12 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), compared with 14 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $25 million. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.11. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is an American sportswear and footwear retailer which has operations in over 28 countries. Evercore ISI upgraded the stock to Outperform in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $60. The firm appreciated the company's strong business model.Foot Locker, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”10.

7,7e297348-2f10-3281-a1a5-b9bd9aba2775,ARE,2023-03-28,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154503001.html,1679931903,STORY,['ARE'],"[Getting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusAlexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is headquartered in Pasadena, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -17.72% since the start of the year. The life science real estate company is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.21 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.04%. This compares to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.9% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.84 is up 2.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.07%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 57%. This means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for ARE for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.95 per share, with earnings expected to increase 6.29% from the year ago period.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that ARE is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

8,43a810f8-2b84-3d7f-892b-4e909e9c0e3e,ARE,2023-03-28,Improve Your Retirement Income with These 3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/improve-retirement-income-3-top-131001533.html,1679922601,STORY,['ARE'],"[Here's an eye-opening statistic: older Americans are more afraid of running out of money than of death itself.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesGoing beyond those familiar names, you can find excellent dividend-paying stocks by following a few guidelines. Look for companies that pay a dividend yield of around 3%, with positive annual dividend growth. The growth rate is key to help combat the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) is currently shelling out a dividend of $1.1 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.51%. This compares to the Financial - Mortgage &amp; Related Services industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 7.95%. Check Federal Agricultural Mortgage (AGM) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is paying out a dividend of $1.21 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 4.04% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.91% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 5.22% over the past year. Check Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.27 per share, BankUnited, Inc. (BKU) has a dividend yield of 4.45%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.52% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 8.7%. Check BankUnited, Inc. (BKU) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?It is true that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds, but high-quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly, can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market.Combating the impact of inflation is one advantage of owning these dividend-paying stocks. Here's why: many of these stable, high-quality companies increase their dividends over time, which translates to rising dividend income that offsets the effects of inflation.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A sort of relief rally in regional banks on the assistance given Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) by First Citizens FCNCA put something of a backstop behind what had been destabilizing the markets a bit over the past few weeks. The Dow gained +189 points, +0.59%, while the Nasdaq was -0.49% on the day. The S&amp;P 500 grew a slight +0.19% but the small-cap Russell 2000 beat the field, +1.10% for the session.We saw Big Banks rise on this latest from SVB, as well, helping put to bed any overheated fears of massive bank contagion, akin to what we saw during the financial crisis of 2008-09. Crude oil has also bounced back today, on a supply disruption in Northern Iraq and a couple trade issues. WTI is back above $73 per barrel, +5% on the day, while the Brent climbed +4% to $78 per barrel. Energy was the top-performing industry on today’s S&amp;P — and is now back within its 200-day moving average. The industry is still trying to climb off the mat as the worst-performing sector of the S&amp;P year to date.Tomorrow morning we get new economic prints, in the form of Case Shiller home price index for January, Inventories and Trade Balance for February and U.S. Consumer Confidence for March. None of these reports will factor as heavily as Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), but we do expect most or all of them to come in smaller than a month ago — especially Case Shiller, which posted +4.6% combined home price gains last time around and only expects +2.5% tomorrow. This would be a favorable number for helping keep inflation in housing under control.After today’s closing bell, PVH Corp. PVH (formerly Phillips-Van Heusen) reported fiscal Q4 earnings results. The parent of popular brands Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and others posted a big beat on its bottom-line: $2.38 per share versus $1.64 (though still down from $2.84 per share a year ago) on $2.4 billion in revenues, which outperformed the $2.34 billion in the Zacks consensus. Gross margins shrunk a bit and still-high inventories were challenges for the brand retailer in the quarter, but shares of the stock gained +10% in late trading.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

The increase included strong revenue growth in Europe, as well as growth in North America, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business, despite the challenging global macroeconomic environment. The Company continued to experience negative impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic in China.Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period (increased 10% on a constant currency basis).Wholesale revenue was flat compared to the prior year period (increased 6% on a constant currency basis).Total digital revenue decreased 8% (decreased 2% on a constant currency basis) compared to exceptionally strong revenue in the prior year period.

Digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 20%.Gross margin was 55.9% compared to 58.3% in the prior year period. The benefit from price increases and a favorable shift in regional and channel mix were more than offset by higher costs and increased promotional activity due to elevated inventory levels industry-wide.Inventory increased 34% compared to the prior year period due to a combination of (i) abnormally low inventory levels in the prior year period, (ii) earlier receipts of inventory, and (iii) higher product costs.Fourth Quarter Consolidated Results:Revenue increased 2% to $2.489 billion compared to the prior year period (increased 8% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 1% reduction resulting from the impact of the war in Ukraine.Tommy Hilfiger revenue increased 3% compared to the prior year period (increased 10% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 3% (increased 11% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 5%Calvin Klein revenue increased 3% compared to the prior year period (increased 8% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein International revenue increased 2% (increased 10% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein North America revenue increased 4%Heritage Brands revenue decreased 10% compared to the prior year period.Earnings before interest and taxes (""EBIT"") on a GAAP basis was $297 million, inclusive of a $21 million negative impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $223 million in the prior year period.

EBIT on a non-GAAP basis for these periods exclude these amounts.EBIT on a non-GAAP basis was $215 million, inclusive of a $21 million negative impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $175 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by revenue growth on a constant currency basis and lower expenses, partially offset by the lower gross margins discussed above. Expenses decreased compared to the prior year period as the Company continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, driving cost efficiencies while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives.Earnings per share (""EPS"")GAAP basis: $2.18 compared to $5.53 in the prior year period.Non-GAAP basis: $2.38 compared to $2.84 in the prior year period.EPS on both a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter included the negative impacts of (i) $0.23 per share related to foreign currency translation and (ii) $0.13 per share related to the war in Ukraine.EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also included the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"" later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for these periods exclude these amounts.Interest expense decreased to $22 million from $24 million in the prior year period.Effective tax rate was 49.7% on a GAAP basis as compared to (96.0)% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 included the negative impact resulting from the $417 million pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which is non-deductible for tax purposes and factored into the Company’s annualized effective tax rate. The effective tax rate in the prior year period included one-time discrete tax benefits of $152 million, principally resulting from a tax accounting method change made in conjunction with the Company’s 2020 U.S. federal income tax return. The effective tax rates on a non-GAAP basis for these periods exclude these impacts. The effective tax rate was 21.7% on a non-GAAP basis compared to (33.2)% in the prior year period. Included in the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis for the prior year period was a discrete tax benefit related to the resolution of uncertain tax positions.Full Year 2022 Consolidated Results:Revenue decreased 1% to $9.024 billion compared to 2021 (increased 5% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 3% negative impact consisting of (i) a 2% reduction resulting from the Heritage Brands transaction (as defined under the heading ""Non-GAAP Exclusions"") and the exit from the Heritage Brands Retail business and (ii) a 1% reduction resulting from the war in Ukraine.Tommy Hilfiger revenue decreased 1% compared to 2021 (increased 7% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger International revenue decreased 4% (increased 6% on a constant currency basis)Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 9%Calvin Klein revenue increased 3% compared to 2021 (increased 10% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein International revenue increased 1% (increased 10% on a constant currency basis)Calvin Klein North America revenue increased 8%Heritage Brands revenue decreased 26% compared to 2021, and includes a 25% decrease resulting from the Heritage Brands transaction and the exit from the Heritage Brands Retail business.EBIT on a GAAP basis was $471 million, inclusive of a $94 million negative impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $1.077 billion in 2021.

In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item was (i) taxable or tax deductible, in which case the tax effect was taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or (ii) non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect.The Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and can have a significant impact on the Company’s reported revenues. The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period).The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, including constant currency revenue information, as a supplement to its GAAP results. The Company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of non-recurring and non-operational amounts and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, and (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding non-recurring and non-operational amounts are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.Please see Tables 1 through 8 and the section entitled ""Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue"" later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.Conference Call Information:The Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter earnings release on Tuesday, March 28, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. EDT.

(the ""Karl Lagerfeld transaction""); (iv) the noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and driven by a significant increase in discount rates; (v) the costs incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 related to initial actions taken under the plans announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, (the ""2022 cost savings initiative""), consisting of severance; (vi) the costs incurred in the first, second and third quarters of 2021 in connection with actions announced in March 2021 to streamline the Company’s organization through reductions in its workforce, primarily in certain international markets, and to reduce its real estate footprint, including reductions in office space and select store closures, consisting of noncash asset impairments, severance, and contract termination and other costs; (vii) the costs incurred in the first and second quarters of 2021 related to exiting the Heritage Brands Retail business, consisting of severance and other termination benefits, accelerated amortization of lease assets, and contract termination and other costs; (viii) the gain recorded in the third quarter of 2021 in connection with the sale of certain intellectual property and other assets of the Company’s Heritage Brands business that closed on the first day of the third quarter of 2021 (the ""Heritage Brands transaction""), which includes a gain on the sale, less costs to sell, and a net gain on the Company’s retirement plans associated with the transaction; (ix) the costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021 in connection with the Heritage Brands transaction, consisting of severance; (x) the tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items and (xi) the one-time discrete tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 principally resulting from a tax accounting method change made in conjunction with the Company’s 2020 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company excludes these amounts because it deems them to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that their exclusion (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.PVH CORP.Non-GAAP Measures (continued)(In millions, except per share data)The following table presents the non-GAAP measures that are discussed in this release.

(NYSE:TMO) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific Thermo Fisher Scientific Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Jim Manzi, sold US$585k worth of shares at a price of US$585 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$562. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock.

In total, Independent Director Jim Manzi dumped US$585k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Thermo Fisher ScientificI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Thermo Fisher Scientific insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$310m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Thermo Fisher Scientific Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought Thermo Fisher Scientific stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.

Here Are 3 Stocks the Banking Giant Likes for Long-Term Growth",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/end-bear-market-may-sight-204211341.html,1679949731,STORY,"['MS', 'TMUS', 'UNH', 'TMO']","[This year started with a strong rally in the markets, but the past month has seen the positive sentiments start to sputter. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank started fears of a contagion and consequent bank runs, which were only partially offset by Federal regulatory actions. But there’s a growing consensus that it was the Federal actions that set the conditions for the bank crisis, when the central bank raised interest rates to fight inflation. Now, investors are trying to cope with the fallout: a simmering bank troubles, persistent high inflation, and elevated interest rates.But not all is doom and gloom. According to Mike Wilson, the chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, what we’re seeing now may herald the beginning of the end in the bear market. While the market is volatile, Wilson describes a positive set-up for investors looking to hold stocks for the long-term.“From an equity market perspective, the [recent] events mean that credit availability is decreasing for a wide swath of the economy, which may be the catalyst that finally convinces market participants that earnings estimates are too high. We have been waiting patiently for this acknowledgment because with it comes the real buying opportunity… We think this is exactly how bear markets end,” Wilson opined.The stock analysts at Morgan Stanley are following Wilson’s lead, and pointing out the equities that offer solid opportunities for the long-term. We’ve looked up the details on three of these picks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)First up is the world’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth. The company is primarily a provider of health insurance policies, and in partnership with employers, providers, and governments, it makes healthcare accessible to more than 151 million people.The scale of this business is visible in the company’s earnings reports. In the last reported quarter, 4Q22, UnitedHealth showed a quarterly top line of $82.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year and some $270 million ahead of expectations. At the bottom line, the company had a non-GAAP EPS of $5.34, up 19% y/y, and above consensus estimate of $5.17. For the full year, UnitedHealth had revenues of $324 billion, for a 13% y/y gain. The firm’s full-year adjusted net earnings came to $22.19 per share.Story continuesLooking ahead, UNH is guiding toward $357 billion to $360 billion in revenues for 2023, and is projecting to bring in $24.40 to $24.90 in adjusted net EPS.Covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, 5-star analyst Erin Wright lays out a simple case for investors to consider, saying, “In health insurance, scale is king and UNH is the largest national insurer with top-three position in almost all insurance end markets. We believe the resiliency of UNH’s diversified businesses will generate long-term double-digit earnings growth with high visibility as a best-in-class vertically integrated MCO in a highly defensive category.”To this end, Wright rates UNH shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her price target of $587 implies a gain of ~22% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Wright’s track record, click here)Overall, the Strong Buy consensus on this stock is backed by 10 recent analyst reviews, featuring a 9 to 1 breakdown favoring Buys over Holds. The stock’s average price target of $599.33 indicates potential for a 24% one-year upside from the current share price of $481.82. As a small bonus, the company also pays regular dividends that currently yield 1.4% annually. (See UNH stock forecast)T-Mobile US (TMUS)The next Morgan Stanley pick we’re looking at is another giant of its industry. T-Mobile is one of the best-known names in the US wireless business, and is the second-largest provider of wireless networking services in the US market.As of the end of 2022, the company had 1.4 million new postpaid accounts for the year, and a total net customer count of 113.6 million. T-Mobile is a leader in the rollout of 5G services in the US, and boasted 2.6 million high-speed internet customers at the end of 2022.Large customer counts and hefty market share have led to strong earnings results. T-Mobile’s last quarterly release, for 4Q22, showed $1.18 in GAAP EPS, beating the forecast by 8 cents, or 7%, and rising an impressive 247% year-over-year.The company achieved those earnings results despite a modest miss in revenue. The quarterly top line of $20.3 billion was $39 million below expectations, and slipped 2.4% y/y.The free cash flow, however, really stood out. T-Mobile generated $2.2 billion in FCF for Q4, and its full-year FCF figure, of $7.7 billion, shown an ‘industry-leading’ increase of 36% while also beating previously published guidance. The company’s cash generation made it possible to support share value by repurchasing 21.4 million shares in 2022 for a total of $3 billion.This stock got the nod from Simon Flannery, another of Morgan Stanley’s 5-star analysts. Flannery wrote of TMUS: “The company has a clear growth strategy predicated primarily on share gains in key, underpenetrated markets: small town/rural, enterprise and top 100 market network seekers. Additionally, T-Mobile has led the way on fixed wireless home broadband as a brand new market opportunity for the company that’s expected to scale to 7-8mn subs by 2025.”Tracking this stance forward, Flannery rates TMUS shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) with a $175 price target indicating ~22% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Flannery’s track record, click here)No fewer than 14 of Wall Street’s analysts have reviewed T-Mobile’s shares recently, and they’ve given the stock 12 Buys and 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are trading for $143.90, with an average price target of $181 to suggest ~26% upside potential by the end of this year. (See TMUS stock forecast)Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)We’ll wrap up this list of Morgan Stanley’s long-term stock picks with Thermo Fisher Scientific, an important player in the field of laboratory research.Thermo Fisher is a maker and supplier of laboratory equipment – scientific instruments, chemicals and reagents, sampling and testing supplies, and even lab-related software systems. Thermo Fisher works with a broad customer base, serving any clients in any field involving lab work; the company frequently deals with academics, medical researchers, and government entities.While Thermo Fisher occupies a highly particular niche, supplying research labs has been profitable in the post-pandemic world. The company’s 4Q22 results saw both the top and bottom line beat expectations, even if they did not expand year-over-year. At the top line, the quarterly revenue of $11.45 billion was a full $1.04 billion above the forecast, while at the bottom line the non-GAAP EPS of $5.40 was 20 cents ahead of consensus estimates.Thermo Fisher caught the eye of Morgan Stanley analyst Tejas Savant who writes: “We like TMO for the breadth of its portfolio, diversified customer base and scale – attributes that we believe will prove advantageous in navigating a potential recession, in addition to inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. TMO’s favorable end market exposure, PPI business system, and track record of consistent all-weather execution underpin our confidence in management’s long-term core organic growth target of 7- 9% with mid-teens EPS growth.”Unsurprisingly, Savant rates TMO shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), while his $670 suggests the stock will grow 19% in the year ahead. (To watch Savant’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has picked up 14 recent analyst reviews, and these include 12 Buys that overbalance 1 Hold and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s average price target of $656.71 implies ~17% one-year gain from the current share price of $561.69.

""So consumables and health that make up over 80% of our sales remain pillars of strength. Consumers aren't trading down, and they aren't sacrificing their pet's needs.""""Where they are cautious is in discretionary spend,"" Singh said, adding that consumers have pulled back in areas such as pet toys.A police dog carries a tennis ball in his mouth at The All England Tennis Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on July 2, 2019, on the second day of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament.

""In terms of the investment curve, look, these are strategic investments, and we are long-term oriented.""Chewy CEO Sumit Singh eyes international expansion for the pet products player.

Gross profit margin expanded 270 basis points from a year earlier to 28.1%. And adjusted operating profits increased by $120.1 million from a year ago.However, the Street took issue with a slight active customer decline sequentially and a potential near-term margin hit from international expansion. Chewy stock was down 12% last week in the wake of the company's earnings report.Some analysts are taking a wait-and-see approach on the stock, pending a reacceleration in active customers — in line with Chewy's guidance.Story continues""The intrinsic value of the business is much more sensitive to the terminal margin assumption than the size of the revenue base, and while 2022 gave us more confidence in a ~mid-single digit percentage EBITDA margin over the medium-term, the beginning of international expansion coupled with still weak net adds and less pricing upside from here leave us more cautious,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Lauren Schenk wrote.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Tesco PLC is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Walmart has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that TSCDY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TSCDY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.69, while WMT has a forward P/E of 23.25. We also note that TSCDY has a PEG ratio of 2.67. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. WMT currently has a PEG ratio of 4.23.Another notable valuation metric for TSCDY is its P/B ratio of 1.38. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WMT has a P/B of 4.57.These metrics, and several others, help TSCDY earn a Value grade of A, while WMT has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesTSCDY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. A counter cyclical stock is a term used to describe the shares of a company that operates in an industry or sector that typically experiences financial performance that is inversely correlated to the overall state of the economy. This means that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the general economic trend. During times of economic downturn or recession, the stock price of a counter cyclical company tends to increase, while during times of economic expansion, it tends to decrease in value. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern for the global economy. Although there have been some recent positive developments, the recovery is expected to be moderate over the next two years. The outlook is fragile, and there are many risks that could lead to a decline in economic activity. The uncertainty created by the war could have a severe impact on trade. Additionally, there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities, particularly in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. Although there has been a decline in headline inflation, it remains high and could persist for a more extended period. The global economy experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with a rate of 3.2%, which was more than 1 percentage point lower than the expected rate at the end of 2021. The main reasons for this were the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting cost-of-living crisis in several countries. OECD predicts that growth will continue to be lower than expected in 2023 and 2024.Against the current economic backdrop, investors who used to have portfolios focused on growth are actively seeking stocks that typically perform well during times of economic downturns and slower growth. These types of stocks, such as PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), are known as counter cyclical stocks and tend to perform better during recessions.Story continuesOur Methodology The companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for this list, including discount retailers, tobacco firms, agriculture and food businesses, as well as healthcare and insurance firms. We chose the top counter cyclical stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Don't Miss: 14 Best Stocks to Buy Before the 2023 Recession Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashBest Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now11. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the biggest tobacco and cigarette companies in the world. Demand for tobacco increases when consumers are facing higher stress, unemployment, and financial constraints during economic slowdowns. On March 9, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.27 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 11, to shareholders of record on March 23. On March 1, UBS upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $116, up from $106. The firm predicts a growth acceleration in the shipment of heated tobacco products in mature markets due to Iluma, and appreciates the company's ""strong cash flow"" in the combustible business. Despite Iluma's current margin dilution, UBS suggests that new product launches will generate immediate volume and share growth, with scale benefits to be realized in the second half of 2023. The launch of Bonds for low-end markets and U.S. IQOS in 2024 is expected to further enhance Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s status as the ""best-in-class"" in the tobacco industry.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was part of 47 hedge fund portfolios, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 24.25 million shares worth $2.45 billion. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”10. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), an American agribusiness and food company, is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to watch. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19. Effective from March 15, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) replaced Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) in the S&amp;P 500.On February 9, Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $115, down from $127. The company topped consensus estimates but issued initial 2023 guidance below Street expectations, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. On February 16, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend, a 4.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.44. The dividend is payable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. In 2023, the company announced its 61st consecutive annual dividend increase, making it a reliable dividend king. On March 20, Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but reduced its price target on the shares from $63 to $60. The firm believes that there is a growing possibility of economic challenges ahead for the consumer staples industry. As a result, Deutsche Bank is becoming more worried about the potential risks to the company's future financial performance across much of its coverage.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 400 million shares worth $25.4 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the biggest American discount retailers. On March 16, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.96, beating market estimates by $0.02. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) also reiterated its plans to execute 3,170 real estate projects in fiscal 2023, including 1,050 new store openings, 2,000 remodels, and 120 store relocations. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to monitor. On March 17, Deutsche Bank increased its estimated price on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) shares from $248 to $249 and maintained a Buy rating following the release of the company's Q4 results. According to the firm, it seems that the market underestimated the expected performance of the company in 2023, which is now anticipated to be more heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. Additionally, Deutsche Bank suggests that the decrease in planned share buybacks may be due in part to higher levels of capital expenditures.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), and Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 788,664 shares worth $194.20 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) contributed to performance in the second quarter following the report of first quarter earnings that were above expectations. Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale worldwide. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The dividend is distributable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to watch. According to Morgan Stanley's recent survey, Walmart+ has 18.4 million members, which is equivalent to 14.3% of U.S. households. This figure is slightly higher than the previous survey and almost the same as the record high of 18.6 million members in September 2022. The firm believes that there is still room for more growth in Walmart+ based on the actual number of members and the number of respondents who are very likely to join. Morgan Stanley recommends buying Walmart shares and reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $160 on March 7. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 66 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7 million shares worth $993.2 million.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates membership warehouses and discount retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan. For the twenty-six week period ended February 26, 2023, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)’s net sales were $116.06 billion, an increase of 7.1% from $108.39 billion last year.On March 10, Roth MKM increased Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)’s price target from $484 to $494 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The company is experiencing difficulties with its comp sales growth slowing down due to inflation and possible competitive pressures affecting its gross margins. Roth MKM informed investors in a research note that even though Costco is gaining market share and may increase its membership fees, the stock's value is still too high, considering the limited potential earnings upside in FY23.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 937,521 shares worth about $428 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to invest in. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:20 Most Advanced Countries in the World in 202325 Best Stocks for Dividends11 Best Space Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Credited for creating the modern-day Ulta (ULTA) as CEO for eight years, Dillon is wasting no time running a similar growth-minded playbook at Foot Locker.Earlier this month at an investor day, the company revealed its ""Lace Up"" plan. As part of the plan, Foot Locker will shutter 400 underperforming stores mostly in lower-tier malls and focus more on off-mall locations. The company will aim to better segment its various sneaker concepts, too.The Foot Locker brand will target sneaker-heads, while Champs Sports will target performance and athleisure shoppers.Over time, Foot Locker sees itself reaching $10 billion-plus in annual sales and a 10% operating margin. The company today is at about $8.5 billion in sales and a 7% operating margin.Dillon acknowledged that 2023 is a reset year as it works to clean up its store footprint and refine its operating model.""2023 is a reset year, we've been very clear about that. But we're investing in the capabilities that we need to really build the next 50 years of Foot Locker fame, I'll call it. So I'm very excited about that,"" Dillon added.Wall Street is seeing the potential in Foot Locker and praising Dillon for her early round of initiatives.""We think a new steady-state algorithm of ~mid-single-digit percentage sales / +high-single-digit to low-double-digit EPS level is very realistic following a significant reset in 2023 to a much healthier base (shrinking Champs, licensing Asia, resetting Nike),"" said EvercoreISI analyst Omar Saad.Saad added: ""But equally importantly, we think Foot Locker will start to flip the script away from a disintermediation narrative to a grow-with-secularly-healthy-sneaker-demand narrative. And with shares trading at just 9x forward EPS (and 5x target 2026 EPS), we see the potential for the multiple to expand to low-to-mid-teens (FL traded mid-to-high-teens prior to disintermediation concerns) as the model transforms in the coming quarters.""Story continuesYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi sits down with Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon.

If you want to read about some more companies in the stock portfolio of Kevin O’Leary, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2023.Kevin O’Leary, one of the most well-known finance personalities on television, has made a number of significant stock investments over the years. As the Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, O'Leary contends that stocks in your portfolio should be high-quality businesses with sound balance sheets and great financial performance. Secondly, he believes that a portfolio should be diversified so as to include a variety of market sectors. The last factor, and perhaps the most important, is the need for dividend payments by the firms he is considering investing in.With that being said, the economic crisis heightened by the coronavirus contagion during the last two years and the spillover effects of it across the globe has led to financial markets being more volatile in 2023 compared to pre-pandemic years. Obviously rising interest rates contribute to this as well. Because it is unclear how the economy will respond to increasing interest rates, stocks are falling. However, O’Leary, in an interview with CNBC, said he firmly believes in retaining stocks during a time of rising interest rates.“Even as rates go up, equities are the place to be because fixed income gets hurt a lot more,” he said. This is greatly evident in the kinds of stocks he invests in. According to the investment mogul, businesses that have control over their prices provide good investment opportunities. In light of the current situation, O'Leary seeks out businesses that may raise prices without facing too much opposition from consumers.“Where you want to be in equities, particularly when rates start taking up, is in companies that have pricing power,” O’Leary added. “In other words, their goods and services are necessities for people, so they are willing to take a small increase in price, sometimes a larger one, as rates go up.” The companies that satisfy this criterion are the ones that belong to the healthcare sector. Story continues“Right now, healthcare looks really good and also consumer cyclicals look very good,” he said. O’Leary further suggests that in times of inflation, investors should focus on businesses that provide goods and services that people still need, particularly ""what they eat"" and ""what they drive.""Another area in which O’Leary thinks people can retain stocks is the energy sector. During the ongoing period of high inflation, the costs of fueling your car, and heating your office or home have become all the pricier. Subsequently, for the past couple of years energy stocks have generated above-average gains. Therefore, the energy sector, O’Leary maintains, is a stable market to invest your stocks in, despite the recent drop in oil prices. Our MethodologyHere is a quick look at Kevin O’Leary’s top 10 picks for stock investments in 2023 that describe not only his philosophy but also provides valuable information on asset management. O’Leary often typically invests in equities of large, successful companies with solid balance sheets and yearly dividend increases that are consistent. The holdings listed below were picked from the ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF Shares (BATS:OUSA). Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2023Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.comKevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: Stock Picks for 202310. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a fairly resilient business. Its large global footprint, extensive restaurant network, well-reputed brand image, and real estate holdings provide it a competitive advantage. In fact, the company's success has been demonstrated by its superior track record compared to a wide range of rivals.With approximately 40,000 stores across more than 100 countries, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is the top global retailer of food service. Around 93% of the stores are independently owned and run. The business is considered a Dividend Aristocrat since it has increased its dividend every year since it paid its first dividend in 1976.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) released its full-year 2022 results and Q4 2022 results on January 31st, 2023. A 5% increase in system-wide sales was offset by currency headwinds to result in total revenue for the quarter of $5,926.5 million, a (1%) decline from $6,009.1 million compared to Q4 2021. In contrast to restaurants with franchises, company-owned stores had a decline in revenue (13%). In comparison to comparable periods, operating costs were lower, resulting in a 19% increase in earnings to $2.59 per share.Geographically, revenues rose by 10.3% in the US, 12.6% internationally, and 16.5% internationally in markets with developmental licenses. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, growth was robust in the UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil and weak in China. Diluted GAAP earnings per share fell to $8.33 for the entire year, and revenue decreased to $23.18 billion.Because of its value proposition, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is doing better than many of its competitors during a period of rising inflation. COVID-19 in China, the conflict in Ukraine, and inflation are obstacles, nevertheless. It is due to such reasons that Kevin O’Leary has made investments in the company. 9. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW)One of the biggest publicly traded asset managers is T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW), which was established in 1937 and has its headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. For individual and institutional investors, retirement plans, and financial intermediaries, the organization offers a wide selection of mutual funds, sub-advisory services, and separate account administration. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW) released its fourth quarter and annual results for the period ending December 31, 2022, on January 26th, 2023. Revenue decreased by 22.4% to $1.52 billion for the quarter, $10 million less than analysts had predicted. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.74 was $0.03 more than expectations while being down from $3.17 in the previous year. Revenue decreased by 15.4% to $6.5 billion for the year, while adjusted earnings-per-share decreased to $8.02 from $12.75 in 2021.Assets under management (AUM) fell 12.6% for the quarter to $1.27 trillion. Net client outflows of $17.1 billion, net payouts of $2.5 billion not reinvested, client transfers of $2.1 billion, and market depreciation were the causes of this decline. Operational costs reached $1.3 billion, up 15.6% annually and 25.4% sequentially.For many years, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW) has been a fantastic company with excellent operating metrics. The company's performance throughout the quarter was once again impacted by market volatility. However, the sector as a whole continues to be hampered by the emphasis on lower fees. 8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the pioneers of revolutionizing the way technology operates ever since it launched the Macintosh in 1984. The tech corporation currently creates, produces, and markets goods like iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs. Apple also operates a services division that offers subscriptions, apps, and music.The company released its Q1 fiscal year 2023 results on February 2, 2023, covering the period ending December 31, 2022 (Apple's fiscal year concludes on the last Saturday in September). Apple's revenue for the period was $117.154 billion, a 5.5% decrease as compared to Q1 2022.The metrics indicate that product sales decreased by 7.7%, with an 8.2% drop in iPhone sales accounting for 56% of all sales. Services accounted for 17.7% of total revenues in the quarter, up 6.4% to $20.8 billion. Compared to $34.630 billion or $2.10 per share in Q1 2022, net income was $29.998 billion, or $1.88 per share.7. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)One of the biggest global pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) focuses on immunizations and prescription medications. Among the most-selling drugs produced by the company are Eliquis, Ibrance, Prevnar, Enebrel (international), Sutent, Xtandi, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Inlyta, Xeljanz, Plaxlovid, and Comiranty. Pfizer released its fourth-quarter results on January 31, 2023, along with its full-year results. On a yearly basis, overall revenue increased by 2% to $24,290M from $23,838M, and adjusted diluted profits per share increased by 45% to $1.14 from $0.79. In comparison quarters, diluted GAAP earnings per share increased by 48% to $0.87 from $0.59.Because of considerable R&amp;D and acquisitions, Pfizer's present product range is anticipated to deliver top line and bottom-line growth through 2028. Inlyta (renal cell cancer), Prevnar family (pneumococcal vaccine), Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine), Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (transthyretin stabilizers), Eliquis (cardiovascular), Ibrance (oncology), Xtandi (oncology), Hospital Products, and Biosimilars are all reporting strong sales growth. Paxlovid, a recently released antiviral, is expanding quickly.Increased sales for approved indications, extensions, R&amp;D, and bolt-on acquisitions will all contribute to future growth. Revenue from COVID will decrease in 2023. However, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) wisely boosted its pipeline by increasing R&amp;D and acquisitions. This high-quality stock may appeal to investors, and the business is rich with cash.6. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC)A multinational holding firm for professional services, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) is involved in risk, strategy, and human resources. Marsh (insurance broker and risk management), Guy Carpenter (reinsurance and capital strategies), Mercer (human resources and consulting), and Oliver Wyman are the company's four primary global operations (strategy, economic, and brand consulting).Almost 130 nations have customers for the company, and there are 86,000 employees worldwide.

(NYSE:XYL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-xylem-inc-183449269.html,1679942089,STORY,['XYL'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Xylem is US$90.30 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$98.59 suggests Xylem is potentially trading close to its fair value The US$113 analyst price target for XYL is 26% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Xylem Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$603.3mUS$677.8mUS$769.6mUS$858.9mUS$999.0mUS$1.09bUS$1.17bUS$1.24bUS$1.30bUS$1.35bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x7Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 9.55%Est @ 7.30%Est @ 5.73%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.86% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.3% US$557US$578US$606US$625US$671US$679US$673US$657US$635US$609(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.3bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.3%– 2.1%) = US$22bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$22b÷ ( 1 + 8.3%)10= US$10.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$16b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$98.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xylem as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.047. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for XylemStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Orlando, who, together with his other company ARC Global Investments, owns 10% of DWAC, remains a director of the company. Eric Swider, another director, was appointed to serve as interim chief executive while the board works on executing a final succession plan.The company, set to merge with former President Donald Trump's social media firm, cited “unprecedented headwinds” that required a change in leadership to enter a ""new phase."" The company has been facing financial issues and is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors in New York City. Its plan to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group has been delayed, resulting in a loss of $100 million.The news of the CEO’s termination comes as Donald Trump faces a potential indictment in Manhattan related to a payment made to porn star Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election.Predict tomorrow's market and get headlines like these in real time with InvestingPro.Norwegian Cruise Line announces CEO retirement and succession planNorwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), the company operating the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands, announced that Frank Del Rio will retire and step down from his position as the company’s President and CEO, effective June 30, 2023. He will serve in a consultant capacity as a Senior Advisor to the Board through 2025.Harry Sommer, who has served as President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line since 2020, will succeed Del Rio and will also join the company's Board of Directors, effective July 1, 2023.Story continuesUnited Natural Foods CEO to resignUnited Natural Foods (NYSE:UNFI) said on Thursday that Michael Stigers notified the company of his intention to resign from his position as CEO to pursue another professional opportunity.

Total capital return is ~4% today (in good part because of its valuation), below the level it was when he purchased the majority of his stake,” said Bernstein.The firm concluded that although Apple is a great company, its valuation seems less appealing both in absolute terms and in comparison to other larger-cap technology companies.Carl Icahn issues a new statement to Illumina shareholdersCarl Icahn wrote a letter to Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) shareholders, urging an investigation “into the massive value destruction caused by the reckless decision” to acquire GRAIL despite objections from European antitrust regulators. Icahn emphasized that the directors required additional personal liability protection a day prior to closing the deal “and buried the news in the hopes that no one would notice”.In response to this, Illumina issued a statement, noting that Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) insurance and corporate indemnification are standard for Delaware companies, and support directors in making decisions in the best interests of shareholders. The company cited The Financial Times that ""it is not uncommon for a company buying another business to increase insurance limits during the acquisition process.""“Mr. Icahn's nominees lack relevant skills and experience for Illumina's Board. Mr. Icahn has no ability to accelerate the legal and regulatory processes and neither do his nominees,” added the company.Related ArticlesHedge funds and C-suites: Trump-linked DWAC fires CEO | Pro RecapRental car firm Hertz's finance chief Cheung to quitU.S. backstops Silicon Valley Bank's sale to First Citizens]"

To that point, the Nasdaq is now up +13% year to date to easily top the broader S&amp;P 500’s +4%.Here are three tech stocks that were recently added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list this week and could rise going into April.Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM) The rally among many semiconductor stocks has boosted the broader technology sector this year and Allegro MicroSystems is a chip-maker investors may want to consider at the moment.Allegro’s Electronics-Semiconductors Industry is currently in the top 35% of over 250 Zacks Industries and the company is poised to benefit as an integrated circuit provider to the automotive and industrial markets.Earnings estimate revisions remained higher throughout the first quarter with Allegro expected to see stellar top and bottom-line growth this year. This has been a catalyst for the strong performance in ALGM shares.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAllegro’s fiscal 2023 earnings are now expected to leap 64% to $1.28 per share compared to $0.78 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to rise another 2%. On the top line, sales are projected to climb 33% this year and rise another 1% in FY24 to $983.70 million.Trading at $46 per share Allegro stock is now up +53% year to date to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq, and the Electronic-Semiconductors Markets +25%. Even better, Allegro stock has soared+162% over the last three years to also outperform the broader indexes, and its Zack Subindustries +137% which is reason to believe its strong performance in 2023 could continue.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip Technology (MCHP)Another semiconductor company that was recently added to the Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list is Microchip Technology. Microchip’s Semiconductor-Analog and Mixed Industry is in the top 32% of all Zacks Industries.Story continuesMicrochip develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory, analog, and interface products for embedded control systems which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.What makes Microchip Technology stock stick out at the moment is its price-to-earnings valuation. With EPS estimates on the rise, Microchip stock trades at $77 per share and 13.2X forward earnings. This is nicely below the industry average of 17.6X and the S&amp;P 500’s 18.3X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlus, Microchip stock trades 52% below its decade-long high of 27.8X and at a 27% discount to the median of 18.2X. Microchip’s fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to jump 30% to $6.00 per share compared to $4.61 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rise another 2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMicrochip stock is up +12% YTD to roughly match the Nasdaq and top the S&amp;P 500 but slightly trail the Semi-Analog &amp; Mixed Markets +16%. Shares of MCHP are now up +124% over the last three years near its Zack Subindustry’s +142% and more upside could certainly be in store given the company’s valuation and growth prospects.Momo (MOMO) Outside of the two domestic chip makers, Momo stock could start to have a strong performance as we head into the spring. Formerly Momo, Hello Group provides a mobile social and entertainment platform primarily in China.The Internet-Software Industry is in the top 25% of all Zacks Industries and Momo’s earnings estimate revisions are very intriguing. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have climbed 29% throughout the quarter with FY24 EPS estimates jumping 25%. Momo’s earnings are now expected to pop 19% this year and jump another 11% in FY24 at $1.75 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, Momo stock trades at $8 per share and just 5.2X forward earnings which is well beneath its industry average of 45.1X. This is also well below its historical high of 209.7X and a 69% discount to the median of 16.7X since going public in 2014.Momo stock is down -7% year to date but the reopening of China’s economy in December appears to be boosting the company’s outlook and should continue to boost investor sentiment as well.Takeaway The rising earnings estimate revisions offer further support to the valuation of these tech stocks and could certainly make them top performers in the broader technology sector as we progress through 2023.With the impressive year-to-date rebound in the Nasdaq attracting investors, Allegro MicroSystems, Microchip Technology, and Momo are stocks to keep an eye on.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even the scaled-down project will be profitable and will work, the company and analysts say.One of the reasons why ConocoPhillips is betting on Alaska while others are leaving is that ConocoPhillips’ chief executive, Ryan Lance, has worked in the state for over a decade and knows the energy and political landscape there, The Wall Street Journal notes.Lance, who began his career in Alaska and has worked there for 14 years, believes that Alaska can still yield a lot of oil, for a long period of time, as the world will need oil and gas for the foreseeable future.At the same time, Lance expects U.S. crude oil production to plateau this decade.“The plateau is on the horizon,” he said at CERAWeek earlier this month, as carried by the Financial Times.“The world is going back to what we had in the ‘70s and the ‘80s unless we do something to change that trajectory,” Lance said, referring to the time when OPEC had a tight grip over the global oil market.According to the executive, OPEC’s market share will jump from around 30% now to close to 50% in the future, in which additional supply comes from OPEC and U.S. shale growth plateaus.ConocoPhillips bets on its newest plan in Alaska to boost production by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd). This could nearly double the company’s output in Alaska— ConocoPhillips’ current production there is just below 200,000 bpd.  Related: Oil Prices Jump 5% On Easing Banking FearsConocoPhillips is Alaska’s largest crude oil producer and the largest owner of exploration leases, with around 1.6 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2021.Story continuesWith other majors leaving, ConocoPhillips could further strengthen its position in the state. BP, for example, sold its upstream business in Alaska to Hilcorp for $5.6 billion three years ago. ConocoPhillips has yet to progress the Willow project to a final investment decision. Willow is set to deliver between $8 billion to $17 billion in new revenue for the federal government, the state of Alaska, and North Slope Borough communities, the company says.But environmentalists – who slammed the Biden Administration for “carbon-bombing” its environmental progress and legacy by approving Willow – have already started filing lawsuits to stop the project.Raena Garcia, Fossil Fuels and Lands Campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said that “President Biden’s approval of the Willow project is a colossal and reprehensible stain on his environmental legacy.” In the days following Willow’s approval, two separate lawsuits by environmental groups were filed. Alaska Wilderness League was among six groups that filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court challenging the Biden administration’s approval of the Willow project, seeking a preliminary injunction in the case. Another group of campaigners also filed a lawsuit to stop the project, saying, “We can only hope that the court sees this for what it is: another unlawful, faulty, and disastrous decision that must be stopped.”Meanwhile, consultancy Wood Mackenzie says that even with a three-well pad development instead of the five-pad project ConocoPhillips had sought, Willow would be economically viable.“With Willow joining other projects like Pikka, new pads at Milne Point, Narwhal, Nuna and Coyote, we see production returning to 700,000 b/d by 2030, levels last seen in 2008,” said Mark Oberstoetter, head of Americas (non-L48) upstream for Wood Mackenzie.Last year, Alaska’s field production of crude oil averaged 437,000 bpd, according to EIA data. Alaska saw a record production of over 2 million bpd in the late 1980s. “Without production from Willow and these other new projects, the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (“TAPS”) would eventually run into low flow issues, jeopardising all production coming from the North Slope,” WoodMac’s Oberstoetter added.In addition, Wood Mackenzie projections suggest Willow’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity would be lower than other Alaska projects, and lower than many of the current sources of U.S. oil imports.

38,18b95c5d-6778-3b23-81ed-7c0b615facfd,O,2023-03-28,Battle For Iraqi Oil Heats Up After Iran-Saudi Deal,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battle-iraqi-oil-heats-iran-230000230.html,1679958000,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Iraq’s crude oil production has been stuck between the 4.0-4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) level since 2016, with a mean average of about 4.5 million bpd during that period, but it could relatively straightforwardly produce 12 million bpd – way more than Saudi Arabia’s true crude oil production average of 8.2 million from 1973 to last Friday. Key elements needed for Iraq to increase its crude oil production to this elevated level are contained in the US$27 billion four-pronged deal agreed with TotalEnergies but there are now doubts that all or part of this deal will proceed as planned. Following the recent landmark resumption of relations between Iran - which retains enormous influence over Iraq through political, military and economic proxies - and Saudi Arabia, brokered by China (and Russia to a lesser degree), it was made clear to Iran it should do all it could to stop major deals being done in Iraq by Western companies. Specifically, a source who works closely with the European Union’s energy security apparatus exclusively told OilPrice.com last week, Iran was told by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin that: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq – and closer to the new Iran-Saudi axis - the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise”.To recap on the TotalEnergies’ proposed deal that, up until the signing of the relationship resumption deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, was going ahead as planned. The first of these projects – and crucial in enabling Iraq to reach its longer-term crude oil production targets of 7 million barrels per day (bpd), and then 9 million bpd and then perhaps 12 million bpd, as analysed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets – was to have been the completion of the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP). The project, which would see an initial investment of US$3 billion in its first phase, involves taking and treating seawater from the Persian Gulf and then transporting it via pipelines to oil production facilities to maintain pressure in oil reservoirs to optimise the longevity and output of fields. The long-delayed plan for the CSSP is that it initially supplies around 6 million bpd of water to at least five southern Basra fields and one in Maysan Province, and is then expanded for use in other fields. The second of the projects is also a matter of high importance and urgent necessity: to collect and refine associated natural gas that is currently burned off at the five southern Iraq oilfields of West Qurna 2, Majnoon, Tuba, Luhais, and Artawi. TotalEnergies was to have provided US$2 billion in the first phase of the project for the building of the processing plant to do this, with initial comments from Iraq’s Oil Ministry last year highlighting that the plant is expected to produce 300 million cubic feet of gas per day (mcf/d) and double that after a second phase of development. Iraqi Oil Minister, Ihsan Abdul Jabbar, stated last year that the gas produced from this second TotalEnergies project in the south will help Iraq to cut its gas imports from Iran.Story continuesRelated: WTI Breaks $70 As Kurdistan Halts Oil ExportsTotalEnergies already has ongoing experience of working across Iraq, holding a 22.5 percent stake in the Halfaya oil field in Missan province in the south and an 18 percent stake in the Sarsang exploration block in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in the north. This gives it very specific operational experience of working on the ground in Iraq, which would also have enabled it to increase crude oil output from the Artawi oil field, which is the third of the four projects to which it was committed. According to earlier comments from Iraq’s Oil Ministry, TotalEnergies would help to boost output from the Artawi oilfield to 210,000 bpd of crude oil, up from the current circa-85,000 bpd. Successfully capturing associated gas rather than flaring it will also allow Iraq to revive the also long-stalled US$11-billion Nebras petrochemicals project with Royal Dutch Shell, which if it went ahead in a professional way could be completed within five years and would generate estimated profits of up to US$100 billion for Iraq within its 35-year initial contract period. The last of the four projects that were to have been undertaken by the French company would be the construction and operation of a 1,000-megawatt solar energy plant in Iraq.So, where is this deal now? “Highly fluid - China wants all the big [oil and gas] reservoirs in the Middle East,” said the EU energy source. “It secured Iran’s with the 25-year deal [Strategic Cooperation Agreement, first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject], which also gave it the chance to leverage its influence more into Iraq’s [oil and gas] reservoirs as well, and now it’s got Saudi Arabia’s too, to add to Russia’s – that’s a lot of oil and gas to control,” he concluded.Indeed, in the oil sphere, China now has effective control of two out of three top oil crude oil exporters – Russia and Saudi Arabia (with the other being the U.S, itself). In addition, China, via Saudi Arabia’s leadership position in OPEC, has considerable influence over that organisation’s oil as well. Whatever OPEC says, it is a cartel in all the ways that matter - organisationally, operationally, and in terms of its collective resources’ power. OPEC was specifically mandated upon its foundation in 1960 to ‘co-ordinate and unify the petroleum policies’ of all of its member states – effectively fixing oil prices, just like a cartel. OPEC’s cartel-like appearance is further enhanced by the facts that its members account for around 40 percent of the world’s crude oil output, about 60 percent of the total petroleum traded internationally from their oil exports and just over 80 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.In the gas sphere, the nearest equivalent to OPEC – although currently not as powerful – is what has been referred to as ‘Gas OPEC’, which is the Gulf Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). Together, Russia, Iran, and Qatar – and Qatar and Iran share the world’s biggest gas field (the North Field/South Pars reservoir) - account for just under 60 percent of the world’s gas reserves, and they were the three countries that founded the GECF. The GECF’s membership now comprises 11 members control over 71 percent of global gas reserves, 44 percent of its marketed production, 53 percent of its gas pipelines, and 57 percent of its LNG exports. Around one year ago, foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, and the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – which has considerable overlap with OPEC and the GECF - were arriving in Beijing for a five-day visit to push ahead on negotiations over the China-GCC Free Trade Agreement (FTA). At these meetings, the principal topic of conversation was to finally seal the China-GCC FTA and a “deeper strategic cooperation in a region where U.S. dominance is showing signs of retreat”.China does not only want to control all the major oil reservoirs in the Middle East but also to get greatly beneficial pricing on everything produced from them. By dint of the 25-year Strategic Cooperation Agreement with Iran it has been able to do this on precisely the terms laid down in my original exclusive piece on the deal. China has been able to use this as the basis for deals done with Iraq, given Tehran’s strong and enduring influence over Baghdad. Specifically, the deals China wants involves 25-year contracts but – critically – ones that only officially start two years after the signing date, so allowing China to recoup more profits on average per year and less upfront investment. The per barrel payments to China for oil would be the higher of either the mean average of the 18-month spot price for crude oil produced, or the past six months’ mean average price. It would also involve at least a 10 percent discount to China for at least five years on the value of the oil it recovered. For gas recovery, the basic terms are the same, but in terms of pricing China wants whichever developer that takes the lead to receive a 30 percent discount to the lowest mean one-year average market price at the key gas pricing hubs for the gas it captured.By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:North American LNG Projects Plagued By Price VolatilityLatin America’s Bid To Challenge China’s Dominance In The Lithium MarketKurdistan’s 400,000-Bpd Oil Exports Still Shut-In As Talks With Iraq FailRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Morgan Stanley in FocusHeadquartered in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -1.26% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.77 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.69%. In comparison, the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield is 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.8%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3.10 is up 5.1% from last year. In the past five-year period, Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 27.74%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 49%. This means it paid out 49% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MS is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.10 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 11.64%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this investment bank have returned -14.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, to which Morgan Stanley belongs, has lost 18.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.72 per share, indicating a change of -16.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.10 points to a change of +11.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.89 indicates a change of +11.1% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.09 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $56.23 billion and $58.49 billion estimates indicate +4.8% and +4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $12.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.2%. EPS of $1.31 for the same period compares with $2.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.16 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.84%. The EPS surprise was +4.8%.Over the last four quarters, Morgan Stanley surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PG&amp;E's 2023-2025 Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP), submitted to California's Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety (Energy Safety), details the company's continued efforts to construct, maintain and operate its system to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfires and help keep its customers and hometowns safe.Pacific Gas and Electric Company logo (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)PG&amp;E's WMP outlines critical layers of protection that work together to reduce wildfire ignition risk and strengthen PG&amp;E's electric grid. These measures include system hardening with stronger poles and covered powerlines; the company's 10,000-mile undergrounding program; tree trimming and removal; inspections and repairs; and improved situational awareness. When wildfire risk is elevated, these efforts are bolstered with operational mitigations that include Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings (EPSS), and Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) under extreme conditions.The plan also introduces new technology solutions such as partial voltage detection and downed conductor technology that build upon the operational mitigations of EPSS and PSPS. These new technologies detect potential threats to the electric grid and rapidly reduce or shut off power to help prevent wildfire ignitions.""Our system has never been safer, and we continue to make it safer every day. Our Wildfire Mitigation Plan outlines multiple layers of protection we're using to stop catastrophic wildfires in our hometowns. We're also doing more than ever to reduce the impacts of EPSS and PSPS on our customers. We want a future where our customers don't have to choose between safety and reliability—we want both and we are working every day to make that possible,"" said PG&amp;E Executive Vice President, Operations and Chief Operating Officer Sumeet Singh.Story continues""In 2022, we continued to enhance our wildfire risk models that predict where, why and how much wildfire risk occurs during a typical wildfire season, and we're using our enhanced risk models to plan and target work and programs to provide the greatest risk reduction for our customers and our hometowns that we are so privileged to serve,"" added Singh.Proven Layers of ProtectionThe WMP highlights several layers of protection that have proved to be effective in reducing wildfire risk. Using these tools, PG&amp;E achieved a 99% decrease in total acres burned in High Fire-Threat Districts in 2022, compared to the 2018-2020 average.Undergrounding powerlines in high fire-risk areas is a permanent protection that reduces the ignition risk from overhead electric distribution lines. PG&amp;E remains committed to undergrounding 10,000 miles in high-risk areas and plans to underground 2,100 miles of powerlines between 2023-2026. Nearly all of the undergrounding work noted in the WMP is in high-risk areas.Additional System Hardening projects such as installing covered conductor, stronger poles, and wider crossarms will provide long-term ignition risk reduction by improving how the grid is constructed and operated. PG&amp;E is also installing break-away connectors at services, which de-energize customer connections when needed to mitigate ignition risk, and is de-energizing or removing idle distribution and transmission facilities with no operational needs within high fire-risk areas.Enhanced Powerline Safety Settings were implemented across 44,000 line-miles, including over 25,000 miles in high fire-risk areas, in 2022 and contributed to a 68% reduction in California Public Utilities Commission-reportable ignitions when enabled on primary distribution lines, compared to the 2018-2020 average. More than half of customers protected by EPSS did not experience a power outage while EPSS was enabled in 2022. However, PG&amp;E recognizes that EPSS outages, when they do occur, are an inconvenience. Compared to the pilot period in 2021, the average outage duration on EPSS-enabled powerlines was 56% shorter in 2022. PG&amp;E is also installing additional sectionalizing devices and animal/avian protection equipment to further reduce the impact of EPSS outages.Vegetation Management strategies have been adjusted based on a risk-informed approach to focus on the highest-risk locations and to help reduce both outages and potential ignitions caused by vegetation contacting PG&amp;E's equipment.Inspections and Repair Efforts are informed by risk models and are part of comprehensive monitoring and data collection programs providing insight into changing environmental hazards around assets to inform mitigation actions.Situational Awareness Improvements include enabling artificial intelligence to process wildfire camera data and provide automated wildfire notifications. PG&amp;E will continue using state-of-the-art weather forecasting and a comprehensive monitoring and data collection network that uses high-definition wildfire cameras and weather stations to help detect, prevent, and respond to the risk of wildfires.Public Safety Power Shutoffs are used as a last resort during extreme weather conditions to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire. PG&amp;E's experienced meteorologists use cutting-edge weather models, using a network of advanced weather stations to forecast risk on a granular basis and factor in vegetation in proximity to overhead electrical lines. PG&amp;E's goal is to continue to minimize the size and duration of any PSPS and reduce impacts to customers without increase to the risk of catastrophic wildfires.New Technology SolutionsThe WMP introduces multiple new technology solutions that are being deployed in concert with proven wildfire risk reduction programs, including the following:Downed Conductor Detection (DCD) technology improves PG&amp;E's ability to detect and isolate high impedance faults—lower-current fault conditions that may not reliably be mitigated by EPSS—before an ignition can occur. PG&amp;E plans to engineer, program and install the DCD algorithm on equipment in high fire-risk areas.Partial Voltage Detection Capabilities utilize SmartMeters to alert the Control Center when voltage conditions that could present an increased ignition risk are detected. This technology helps PG&amp;E detect and locate wire-down conditions for lower-current fault conditions—which may not reliably be mitigated by EPSS—within minutes so the line can be remotely de-energized from the Control Center for faster mitigation and to reduce the amount of time a line is energized while down.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE: PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Blazes sparked by the utility’s power lines and equipment that killed scores of people and destroyed more than a million acres pushed the company into bankruptcy in 2019. Since then, regulators have required PG&amp;E and other investor-owned utilities to submit detailed mitigation plans.Edison International’s Southern California Edison also filed a wildfire-prevention proposal with the state on Monday, saying it will continue covering conductors and burying more lines in the highest-risk locations. Edison said it’s cut the probability of its equipment sparking conflagrations by as much as 80% since 2018.PG&amp;E, whose lines were blamed for California’s fiercest blazes for two years in a row, said it has reduced its wildfire risk by more than 90%.PG&amp;E Chief Operations Officer Sumeet Singh said if recent changes to safety operations had been in place in 2021 and 2022, those earlier blazes wouldn’t have started.PG&amp;E also will deploy new technology that can more easily detect a problem on a power line, Singh said. For the first time, the utility will use artificial intelligence to identify and respond to blazes, he added.Story continues“The focus for us is that we’re going to continue to build upon the successes from last year, which really is centered around constructing, maintaining and operating our electric grid in a manner that minimizes the risk of catastrophic wildfires,” Singh said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeChina Lent Heavily to Developing Nations.

For more such countries, go to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity. Cyberspace is increasingly being considered the fifth dimension of warfare after land, sea, air and space. Interest in cybersecurity has increased during recent years for both offensive and defensive purposes, as battlefield and strategic-weapons management, and military operational coordination is increasingly happening in cyberspace. In this respect, cyberspace has paved the way for strategic offensive advantages in its domain, and necessitated defensive capabilities and cyber resilience as well. The US, in this regard, has launched the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, through its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). CISA is expected to have its funding increased by 12% in FY2023, reaching $2.9 billion, which is $313 million above the funding it received in the last fiscal year. The budget is expected to help CISA enhance its threat hunting, cyber-vulnerability management and cybersecurity training programs. When it comes to the organization’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative program, it is enlisting several major tech corporations like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to help improve its cybersecurity infrastructure. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is known for the widely used security system called Microsoft Sentinel, which delivers across-enterprise threat intelligence. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also known for Priva, Purview and Entra, among other advanced security solutions.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), on the other hand, boasts cloud-based security solutions like Cloud IDS, VPC Service Controls and Confidential Computing, among Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s top solutions. Lastly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates various top-notch cybersecurity services in its Amazon Web Services cloud.Story continuesCybersecurity Trends to Watch: 2030Among the cybersecurity trends for 2030 highlighted by the World Economic Forum, concerns surrounding the abuse of AI capabilities in cyber threats were the most noteworthy in terms of malware, ransomware, online social engineering and propaganda. Machine learning is advancing at a rapid pace and AI can be used to create malware that is more difficult to detect and harder to remove. For example, attackers can use AI to create polymorphic malware that changes its code every time it infects a new system.Machine learning models can also be used to carry out more sophisticated and effective ransomware attacks. Attackers can use AI to identify valuable targets and customize their ransom demands based on the target's financial situation.Cybersecurity Industry Outlook: 2030According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cybersecurity market was valued at $203 billion as of 2022, and is projected to grow at a solid CAGR of 12.3% during the forecast period of 2023-2030, reaching $500.7 billion in value by 2030. Factors driving the growth include an increasing number of cyberattacks, cloud computing and losses that firms are incurring due to cyberattacks, motivating them to seek cybersecurity solutions. According to a report by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), the global average cost that companies incur due to data breaches is $4.35 million as of 2021. Since the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) report, data breaches have increased by 13%, with 83% of the studied organizations having their data breached more than once. One of the problems highlighted in the industry by the Grand View Research report is the high costs of cybersecurity solutions, compelling many enterprises to seek unlicensed solutions, which although work against known threats, are ineffective against novel threats, and are often carrying trojans themselves. The GVR report further highlighted that the hardware segment, within the broader cybersecurity industry, is growing at a high growth rate of over 12%. On the other hand, the cloud security segment held the highest share of revenue in 2022, at over 25%. Defense contracts accounted for more than 20% of the global market, and when it comes to regional cybersecurity markets, Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing. Many countries have advanced highly in cybersecurity, primarily for military purposes, like Israel. It is popularly known for Pegasus spyware developed by NSO Group. Pegasus is a suite of exploits that targets many different vulnerabilities in computer systems. Israel was also among the countries which were accused by Iran for the Stuxnet attack, which sabotaged Iranian centrifuges. Israel has a formidable reputation in cybersecurity and ranks on the top 19th spot on the Belfer Center’s National Cyber Power Index of 2022. It is particularly ahead in dimensions like destructive and defensive cyber capabilities but lags behind many other countries in the financial and information-control dimensions of cybersecurity. With the backdrop, let’s head to the 12 most advanced countries in cybersecurity. 12 Most Advanced Countries in CybersecurityPhoto by Jefferson Santos on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have defined ‘advanced countries in cybersecurity’ as ones which are well-equipped in cyberspace in terms of infrastructure and talent, and boast high capability and readiness in the industry for both defense and industry-related purposes.In this respect, we’ve relied on the National Cyber Power Index of 2022 by Cyber Project and ranked the countries as such, in ascending order of high advancement in cybersecurity. Here are the 12 most advanced countries in cybersecurity. 12. UkraineUkraine boasts capabilities in threat intelligence and cyber defense, developed as a reaction to the country being a target of numerous cyberattacks, including the NotPetya ransomware attack. In 2016, Ukraine created a National Cybersecurity Coordination Center to facilitate cooperation between government agencies, private companies, and international partners in addressing cyber threats. Additionally, Ukraine has developed a number of initiatives to promote cybersecurity education and training, including the establishment of specialized universities and training programs.Ukraine is also home to a number of leading cybersecurity companies, including Ciklum, a global software engineering and technology company that specializes in cybersecurity, and whose board is chaired in Kyiv, and SoftServe, a digital-solutions company which offers a range of cybersecurity services. 11. GermanyGermany is home to several world-renowned cybersecurity research institutions and companies, and the German government has taken significant steps to strengthen the country's cybersecurity posture.For instance, Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) is one of the world's leading cybersecurity research institutions. The institute conducts research on a range of cybersecurity topics, including secure communication protocols and secure software development.Germany is also home to a number of cybersecurity companies, such as Siemens Cybersecurity and G DATA CyberDefense. These companies provide a range of cybersecurity services, including threat detection and response, data protection, and risk management.The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) of the German government also operates a national cybersecurity emergency response team and conducts cybersecurity research and development.10. IranIran, like Ukraine, has been the target of sophisticated cyberattacks, including the Stuxnet worm attack, which sabotaged Iranian centrifuges in relation to the country’s nuclear program. Iran has made progress in developing its own technology and capabilities in this area. The country has established several cybersecurity research centers, including the Iran Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center (CERTCC), which is responsible for managing cybersecurity incidents and providing training and support to other organizations.Iran has also developed its own cybersecurity software and tools for both defensive and offensive purposes, including antivirus programs and intrusion detection systems. Iran was accused of the Shamoon-malware attack, which targeted the industrial and energy sectors in gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s X-Force also suspects elements in Iran to be behind the development and deployment of 'Zerocleare', a malware from the Wiper class, which was used against industrial targets in a number of Middle Eastern countries. 9. FranceFrance has established several cybersecurity research centers, including the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), which is responsible for ensuring the security of France's critical infrastructure and government networks. ANSSI also provides support and advice to private sector organizations on cybersecurity issues.France has also made significant investments in cybersecurity research and development, with a focus on areas such as artificial intelligence, cryptography, and secure communication technologies. One of the latest investment announcements of $1 billion came in 2021, when French hospitals were targeted with cyberattacks amid the pandemic, with hospitals accounting for 11% of all cyberattacks in the country in 2020. In addition to its domestic capabilities, France is also an active participant in international cybersecurity initiatives and partnerships, including the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE).8. South KoreaSouth Korea has been known for various high-profile cybersecurity tools. Among these is AhnLab V3, which uses a combination of signature-based and behavior-based detection techniques to identify and prevent malware attacks.South Korea has several institutions dedicated to cybersecurity, including the Korea Internet and Security Agency (KISA) and the National Intelligence Service (NIS). The government has also implemented various policies and initiatives to promote cybersecurity, including the establishment of a national cybersecurity strategy and the adoption of advanced technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance cybersecurity.7. VietnamVietnam is rapidly emerging as one of the top players in cybersecurity, with the country having the foundation of numerous offensive/defensive cybersecurity tools to its credit.Some of these include BKAV, an antivirus program developed by Vietnam’s Bkav Corporation, Aegis, an advanced threat detection and prevention program developed by Viettel Cyber Security, and CyRadar, a vulnerability assessment program developed by Vietnam’s Computer Emergency Response Team. The country has also joined several international organizations focused on cybersecurity, including the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity and the APEC Cybersecurity Strategy.6. NetherlandsThe Netherlands is one of the most advanced countries in cybersecurity. The Dutch government has established several cybersecurity research and innovation centers, such as the Delft University of Technology and the Dutch Cybersecurity Consortium, which brings together academic institutions, businesses, and government agencies to develop new cybersecurity technologies and strategies.In addition, the Netherlands has a strong cybersecurity industry, with numerous cybersecurity companies, including Fox-IT and Northwave, which provide cybersecurity services and solutions to both domestic and international clients. Apart from that, it also hosts companies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which provide cutting-edge cloud security solutions to enterprises in the country. Cybersecurity is also highly institutionalized in the Dutch private sector. According to a 2019 report by Hiscox, companies in the Netherlands spend an annual average of $1.9 million on cybersecurity.  Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity.  Suggested Articles:12 Best Cybersecurity Stocks to Buy NowTop 10 Growth Stocks in Cybersecurity15 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy According to AnalystsDisclosure: none. 12 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Operating loss in the period reflects a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 34.1 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting a COVID-19 headwind of approximately 24 percent, planned payroll and IT investments in U.S. Retail Pharmacy and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare, partly offset by improved retail contributions in the U.S., and International growth.For the first six months of fiscal 2023, net loss was $3.0 billion compared to net earnings of $4.5 billion in the year-ago period. This decrease is driven by a $5.4 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation offset by a $1.4 billion after-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen, and lapping a $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the Company's investments in VillageMD and Shields Health Solutions in the year-ago period. Adjusted net earnings were $2.0 billion, a decrease of 28.1 percent on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower adjusted operating income.Loss per share for the first six months of fiscal 2023 was $3.50 compared to EPS of $5.15 from the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS decreased 29.0 percent to $2.32, reflecting a decrease of 27.9 percent on a constant currency basis, mainly due to a COVID-19 headwind of approximately 22 percent.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2023, a decrease of $0.9 billion from the year-ago period, and free cash flow was $560 million, a decrease of $754 million from the year-ago period driven by lower earnings and increased capital expenditures in growth initiatives, partially offset by ongoing working capital optimization.Business HighlightsWBA continues to achieve strong results across its business and strategic priorities, including:Transform and align the coreU.S. pharmacy comparable script volume growth of 3.5 percent excluding immunizations, ahead of expectations and sequentially improving vs. the first quarter of fiscal 2023Addressed industry-wide pharmacist labor shortage by returning an incremental ~500 stores to normal pharmacy operating hours, with ~1,900 stores still impacted at quarter-endContinuing to play a leading role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 2.4 million vaccinations in the quarter compared to 11.8 million in the prior yearU.S. retail comparable sales decline of (1.0) percent, including a 500 basis point headwind from lower OTC test kits, on top of a very strong prior year performance of 14.7 percentOperating nine automated micro-fulfillment centers at quarter-end, supporting ~3,600 storesBoots UK retail comparable sales growth of 16.0 percent, on top of robust prior year growth of 22.0 percentBuild our next growth engine with consumer-centric healthcare solutionsInvested $3.5 billion to support VillageMD’s acquisition of Summit Health, closed January 3, 2023Signed Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey as fourth payor partner for Walgreens HealthClosed full acquisition of Shields on December 28, 2022Full acquisition of CareCentrix expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2023Managing approximately 806,000 value-based lives under VillageMD/Summit HealthOperating 210 co-located VillageMD clinics, part of approximately 730 total locations inclusive of Summit HealthOperating 117 Walgreens Health CornersSigned the Company's first five clinical trials contractsFocus the portfolio; optimize capital allocationSold 15.5 million shares of Option Care Health common stock in March, with after-tax cash proceeds of $466 millionSold 6.0 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock in December, with after-tax cash proceeds of $972 millionSold entire stake of Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals in December for approximately $150 millionBuild a high-performance culture and a winning teamAppointed Rick Gates as senior vice president and chief pharmacy officer, WalgreensAppointed Tracey Brown as executive vice president, retail and chief customer officer, WalgreensLaunched FY22 Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ReportIncluded as part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for the third consecutive year, scoring in the 87th percentile within the Food &amp; Staples Retailing industry groupBusiness SegmentsU.S. Retail Pharmacy:The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment had second quarter sales of $27.6 billion, a decrease of 0.3 percent from the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales increased 3.1 percent from the year-ago quarter while lapping strong comparable sales growth of 9.5 percent in the year-ago quarter, which included a significant contribution from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing.Pharmacy sales increased 0.3 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by a 3.5 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.9 percent in the quarter, benefiting from branded drug inflation. Comparable prescriptions filled in the quarter increased 0.2 percent, while comparable prescriptions excluding immunizations increased 3.5 percent, a sequential improvement of 140 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Total prescriptions filled in the quarter, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 0.7 percent to 298.0 million.Retail sales decreased 1.8 percent and comparable retail sales decreased 1.0 percent in the second quarter compared to comparable sales growth of 14.7 percent in the prior year quarter. Excluding tobacco, comparable retail sales decreased 0.5 percent including a 500 basis point headwind from lower sales of OTC test kits, partly offset by strong core growth across all categories.Gross profit decreased 10.2 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross profit decreased 9.8 percent. Gross profit and adjusted gross profit were entirely driven by a 10 percentage point headwind from lower contributions from COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. Reimbursement net of procurement savings was offset by higher retail gross profit from gross margin expansion and strong underlying sales performance across categories.Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) increased 6.3 percent to $5.5 billion, including a $306 million pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation in the current quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A decreased 3.2 percent to $4.9 billion, driven by reduced labor for lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program, partly offset by increased labor investments.Operating income in the second quarter was $0.4 billion compared to operating income of $1.4 billion from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the $306 million charge related to opioid claims and litigation in the current quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 32.8 percent to $1.1 billion from the year-ago quarter, reflecting a 29 percentage point headwind from lower contributions of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, continued reimbursement pressure net of procurement, and planned labor investments. These impacts were partly offset by improved retail gross profit, driven by gross margin expansion and strong underlying sales performance across categories.International:The International segment had second quarter sales of $5.7 billion, an increase of 1.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, held back by an adverse currency impact of 7.5 percentage points. Sales increased 9.0 percent on a constant currency basis, with Boots UK sales growing 11.0 percent, and the Germany wholesale business growing 7.5 percent.Boots UK comparable pharmacy sales increased 2.0 percent compared with the year-ago quarter held back by lower demand for COVID-19 services. Boots UK comparable retail sales increased 16.0 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, growing market share for the eighth consecutive quarter. Footfall improved by 16 percent, compared to the year-ago quarter. Boots.com continued to perform well, accounting for over 15 percent of retail sales in the quarter compared to approximately 9 percent pre-pandemic.Gross profit decreased 0.7 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, including an adverse currency impact of 8.2 percentage points. Gross profit increased 7.5 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting higher UK retail sales and solid execution in the Germany wholesale business, partly offset by lower demand for COVID-19 related services in the UK and the adverse gross margin impact of National Health Service pharmacy funding.SG&amp;A in the quarter decreased 18.2 percent from the year-ago quarter to $846 million, including a favorable currency impact of 7.6 percentage points, and lower acquisition related costs. Adjusted SG&amp;A decreased 5.9 percent on a constant currency basis, reflecting real estate gains from the company's cash mobilization program in Germany, and effective cost management, partly offset in the UK by increased in-store and marketing activities, higher inflation, and lapping temporary COVID-19 related benefits in the year-ago quarter.Operating income increased 104.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $353 million. Adjusted operating income increased 55.8 percent to $352 million, an increase of 65.7 percent on a constant currency basis.U.S. Healthcare:The U.S. Healthcare segment had second quarter sales of $1.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. On a pro forma basis, the segment's businesses grew sales at a combined rate of 30 percent in the quarter. VillageMD, including Summit Health, grew pro forma sales 30 percent, reflecting existing clinic growth, and clinic footprint expansion. Shields grew pro forma sales 41 percent, driven by recent contract wins, further expansion of existing partnerships, and strong executional focus. CareCentrix grew pro forma sales 25 percent as a result of additional service offerings with existing partners.Gross profit was $32 million as Shields and CareCentrix gross profit was more than offset by VillageMD's expansion. VillageMD added 133 clinics compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted gross profit was $110 million, an increase of $95 million compared to the year-ago period as the segment continues to rapidly scale.Second quarter SG&amp;A was $504 million, and adjusted SG&amp;A was $269 million. Adjusted SG&amp;A increased by $177 million compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the acquisitions of CareCentrix and Summit Health which were not included in the year-ago quarter, and higher investments in the organic business.Operating loss was $472 million. Adjusted operating loss was $159 million, which excludes certain costs related to stock compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition related costs. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $109 million, reflecting VillageMD expansion and higher organic business investments, partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix.Conference CallWBA will hold a conference call to discuss the second quarter results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, March 28, 2023.

AND SUBSIDIARIESSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release.The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, such as unusual one-time charges, tax expenses, and material litigation expenses, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.Constant currencyThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in ""constant currency,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. transacting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Comparable salesFor the Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International segments, comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the Company's method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.With respect to the International segment, comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales, are presented on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the discussion above in ""Constant currency"" for further details on constant currency calculations.Key Performance IndicatorsThe Company considers certain metrics, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, number of payor/ provider partnerships, number of locations of Walgreens Health Corners, number of VillageMD co-located clinics and number of total VillageMD/Summit/CityMD locations, at period end, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.With respect to the total number of VillageMD locations, locations are defined as the primary care locations where the Company or the Company’s affiliates lease or license space and the providers are employed by either the Company or one of the Company’s affiliates. These locations are primarily branded as Village Medical where the Company employs the providers but, in some instances, may operate under their own brands.NET EARNINGS (LOSS) AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE(in millions, except per share amounts)Three months endedFebruary 28,Six months endedFebruary 28,2023202220232022Net earnings (loss) attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

A little more than half of futures traders are betting on a pause at the Fed's meeting in May, while just under half believe there's another quarter of a percentage point hike in store. Pressure on the banking system, which is expected to result in a pullback in credit, is seen slowing the economy on its own without the Fed acting. But the central bank still wants to push inflation back down toward its 2% goal, and it still isn't there yet.Still, Fed forecasts are for the terminal rate to top out around 5.1% this year, which implies another rate increase based on the current fed funds range.This week brings key data on inflation for February, along with home price data, weekly jobs data, and the last print of gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter. The Fed will likely factor all of it into its next decision, while also balancing its view of the banking system.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Micron earningsChipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) is expected to report a loss per share of 65 cents on revenue of $3.74 billion.2. Lululemon earningsAnalysts expected athleisure wear maker Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) to report earnings per share of $4.26 on revenue of $2.7B.

However, the prevailing tough macroeconomic environment might hamper the company’s margin. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Walgreens exited first-quarter fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company’s U.S. Healthcare business grew, led by key contract wins, continued partnership growth and a strong focus on execution. The company achieved the calendar-year 2022 target for co-located VillageMD clinics of 200.The company continues to play a leading role in COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, administering 8.4 million vaccinations in the reported quarter. Walgreens raised its U.S. Healthcare target in November, including the fiscal 2025 sales goal of $14.5-$16.0 billion, up from $11.0-$12.0 billion previously. Moreover, the company raised its 2023 sales guidance, reflecting continued growth momentum.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. PriceWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteDuring the first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings update, Walgreens stated that it has launched 24-hour same-day delivery, offering the widest range of retail items for around-the-clock delivery across the country. This adds to the company’s broad range of channel access, including one-hour delivery and 30-minute pickup.In June 2022, Walgreens launched its clinical trial business to redefine the patient experience and bolster access and retention in sponsor-led drug development research. In March 2022, the company, in collaboration with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, announced the nationwide availability of “Pixel by LabCorp COVID-19 at-home collection kit” at no cost to individuals who meet clinical guidelines.In terms of new partnerships, in November 2022, VillageMD entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Summit Health-CityMD — a leading provider of primary, specialty and urgent care.Story continuesIn October 2022, Walgreens announced the acceleration of its plans to acquire full ownership of CareCentrix, expanding its reach into the growing homecare sector and advancing its healthcare long-term growth strategy.On the flip side, over the past year, Walgreens has underperformed the industry. The stock has lost 31.4% compared with the industry’s 30.1% decline.During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, Walgreens’ Pharmacy sales decreased 4.2% compared with the year-ago quarter, negatively impacted by a 7.8 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. Comparable pharmacy sales declined 0.9%, reflecting lower demand for COVID-19 services.  The International segment declined year over year due to an adverse currency impact of 15.4%.In the last few years, the slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens’ margins.

75,e40cda7a-1f38-35e7-891c-b19ed1ab83c7,PAYX,2023-03-28,3 Stocks to Watch From the Promising Outsourcing Space,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-watch-promising-outsourcing-154703913.html,1679932023,STORY,"['PAYX', '^GSPC', 'G']","[The Zacks Outsourcing industry seeks to benefit from the increased adoption of cloud computing and other emerging technologies. Operational efficiency and reduced expenses on the back of the successful work-from-home trend and the hybrid working model have been driving competitive advantage besides increasing innovation and speed to market.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP, Paychex, Inc. PAYX and Genpact Limited G are some stocks that are likely to gain from the abovementioned industry trends. However, rising data security issues, thanks to increased dependency on technology, are concerns for the industry.Industry DescriptionOutsourcing is the practice of transferring control of certain operations, services or processes, previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources, to external resources or third-party contractors to improve operating efficiency by focusing on core business competencies. The Zacks Outsourcing industry comprises companies engaged in providing human capital management solutions, business management solutions and information technology solutions to human resource, payroll, benefits, and retirement and insurance services to small- and medium-sized businesses. Some industry participants also provide business process services with capabilities in transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation in the United States and abroad.What's Shaping the Future of the Outsourcing Industry? A Healthy Demand Environment: Increasing demand for expertise in improving efficiency and reducing costs has benefited the industry over the past several years. The industry has witnessed growth in revenues, income and cash flow over the past few years, enabling most players to pursue acquisitions and other investments, and pay out stable dividends.Rising Dependency on Technologies: Most of the industry participants are also considering emerging technologies such as cloud computing to drive competitive advantage, increase innovation, improve speed to market and drive performance within the industry. The wider application of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be the biggest change induced by the pandemic. The adoption of AI should lower complications and simplify operations. This should aid the industry.Story continuesNotably, industry players are in the process of modernizing their traditional legacy-oriented business processes in order to keep themselves flexible in any kind of operating environment.Growing Security Issues and Remedies: COVID-led increased dependency on technology has led to growing cases of hacking, identity theft and malicious payload deliveries. With work-from-home models being the new-normal professional scenario, remote infrastructure vulnerabilities and security gaps are being exploited to secure unauthorized access to proprietary systems and data.As a preventive measure to enhance data security and ensure cyber-resilience, secure access technologies such as VPNs, two-factor authentication and other ID and access-management controls for home workers, as well as monitoring and threat-detection tools, are being used. Outsourced service providers are also updating organizational policies (including Bring Your Own Device and work-from-home policies) and data breach protocols in order to reduce security risks. Adequate training of employees about emerging threats and data security issues is also being prioritized by several companies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Encouraging ProspectsThe Zacks Outsourcing industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #44. This rank places it in the top 18% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The buy-side analysts covering the companies in this industry have been increasing their estimates. Over the past year, the industry’s consensus earnings estimate for the current year has increased 17.7%.Before we present a few stocks that investors can retain given their growth prospects, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and current valuation.Industry's Price PerformanceThe Zacks Outsourcing industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Business Services sector as well as the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has declined 7.7% over this period compared with a 19.8% decline of the broader sector and 14.2% decrease of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing outsourcing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.99X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 17.83X and the sector’s 22.41X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 30.50X, as low as 18.75X and at the median of 24.54X, as the charts below show.Forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E)3 Outsourcing Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe are presenting three Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks that are well-positioned to grow in the near term.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Automatic Data Processing: This New Jersey-based company provides cloud-based human capital management solutions worldwide. Amid a challenging scenario, Automatic Data Processing remains strong, backed by its momentum in sales, client satisfaction and client retention. Higher operating revenues and effective cost-containment measures have helped the company improve its margin performance. The company continues to enjoy a dominant position in the human capital management market through strategic buyouts like Celergo, WorkMarket, Global Cash Card and The Marcus Buckingham Company. It has a strong business model, high recurring revenues, good margins, robust client retention and low capital expenditure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADP’s 2023 EPS has moved up 0.3% in the past 90 days. ADP’s shares have declined 7.7% over the past six months.Price &amp; Consensus: ADP Paychex: This New York-based company provides integrated human capital management solutions. Paychex continued to enjoy higher revenues per client resulting from improved price realization, growth in client base across HCM, and ancillary products resulting from strong sales performance and high levels of retention. An increase in the number of average worksite employees, the impact of an increase in average wages per worksite employee and a rise in PEO health insurance revenues act as other tailwinds. Acquisitions have expanded Paychex's customer base, besides generating cost and revenue synergies. Consistency in rewarding shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases boosts investor confidence and positively impacts earnings per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Paychex’s 2023 EPS has improved 0.2% in the past 90 days. Paychex’s shares have declined 7.2% over the past six months.Price &amp; Consensus: PAYX Genpact: This Bermuda-based company provides business process outsourcing and IT services in North and Latin America, India, the rest of Asia and Europe. Genpact enjoys a competitive position in the BPO services market, based on its domain expertise in business analytics, digital and consulting. Acquisitions have been helping it in expanding its product portfolio and gaining new domain expertise. AI offers ample growth opportunities amid the COVID-induced dependency on technology. Consistency in rewarding shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases boosts investor confidence and positively impacts earnings per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Genpact’s 2023 EPS has improved 0.3% in the past 90 days.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) share price is up 88% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 47% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 27%.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Monster Beverage In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years of share price growth, Monster Beverage moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Monster Beverage's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Monster Beverage shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 27% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 13%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Monster Beverage better, we need to consider many other factors.

Also, Monster Beverage is focused on transitioning to the Coca-Cola distribution system in the Philippines in the second quarter of 2023.Strength in its energy drinks category has been long serving as a catalyst. In fourth-quarter 2022, the Monster Energy Drinks segment's net sales increased 2.6% year over year to $1.4 billion. The segment’s sales included a negative impact of $76.9 million from adverse currency rates. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the segment rose 8.3%.According to Nielsen, sales for the energy drinks category, including energy shots, increased 15.1% year over year for the 13 weeks ended Feb 11, 2023. Sales for the company's energy brands, including Reign, rose 14.8% in the 13-week period ended Feb 11, 2023. Sales for the Monster brand improved 13% year over year in the quarter.Also, sales for the Strategic Brands segment, which include affordable energy drink brands and a range of energy drink brands acquired from Coca-Cola, rose 41.8% to $65.6 million in the fourth quarter. On a currency-adjusted basis, net sales for the Strategic Brands segment increased 49.4%. Management is optimistic about strength in the global energy drinks category and remains poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands and strength in strategic and affordable energy brands.It is on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. MNST has been implementing price hikes since the first half of 2022. Notably, the company implemented a price increase of 6% market-wide in the United States, effective Sep 1, 2022, and will implement a price increase on its 24-ounce line, effective Apr 1, 2023. It also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will implement additional price increases on a phased approach in the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets.Story continuesCost HeadwindsMonster Beverage has been reeling under the strong US dollar, as well as cost inflation related to increased energy costs, particularly in EMEA, ingredient and other input costs, and co-packing fees. This led to a weak bottom line in fourth-quarter 2022, wherein earnings declined 4.9% year over year.The company witnessed a significant increase in the cost of sales, which caused a decline in the gross profit and the gross margin rate. The cost of sales of $728.6 million was up 11% year over year due to the higher logistics costs, and unfavorable geographical and product sales. Elevated ingredients and other input costs, comprising secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, also hurt the cost of sales.The gross margin contracted 210 basis points (bps) to 51.8%, driven by higher ingredient and other input costs, geographical and product sales mix, and elevated logistical costs, offset partly by pricing actions. The metric increased on a sequential basis, driven by pricing actions, as well as recovery in the supply chain.Also, a significant rise in distribution expenses, including increased fuel, freight and warehousing costs, remains concerning. As a result, operating expenses grew 10% year over year to $390 million in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The increase can be attributed to higher warehousing and other logistical expenses, elevated payroll expenses, and increased general and administrative expenses. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses rose 90 bps to 25.8%, while the metric contracted 310 bps on a three-year basis.Higher operating expense rates mainly resulted from increased distribution costs, stemming from higher warehousing expenses and other logistical expenses. Distribution costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased 10 bps to 5% and 150 bps on a three-year basis. General and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, rose 100 bps year over year, while the metric contracted 200 bps on a three-year basis to 11.1%.Consequently, operating income of $394.4 million declined 4.5% year over year, driven by a decrease in the gross margin, as well as higher operating expenses. The operating margin contracted 290 bps to 26.1% in the reported quarter.Bottom LineMonster Beverages appears well-placed for further growth despite rising costs, driven by the introduction of innovative products across the Monster family to suit consumers’ needs, as well as strength in its energy drinks category. A long-term earnings growth rate of 22.5% raises optimism on the stock. Also, a Momentum Score of B bodes well.Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked food stocks are Post Holdings POST, General Mills GIS and Vital Farms VITL.Post Holdings, which operates as a consumer-packaged goods company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

88,687df346-4999-3853-8138-4c30ee547a43,HST,2023-03-28,Analyst Lowers Boom On Hotel REITs: What's Going On?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-lowers-boom-hotel-reits-182811549.html,1679941691,STORY,"['SHO', 'HST']","[One of the most interesting things about the U.S. stock market is how quickly sentiment can change on individual stocks or a sector in general, depending on recent news or their most recent performance. Yesterday’s winners can be today’s losers in the blink of an eye or vice versa.That was the case this week when one analyst decided to downgrade three real estate investment trusts (REITs) from the hotel subsector. All three REITs performed well for a while in early 2023 as the hotel subsector came roaring back from large total losses in 2022.Take a look at three hotel REITs that were downgraded this week by Compass Point Research &amp; Trading analyst Floris van Dijkum and the share price losses that ensued.Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE: APLE) is a Richmond, Virginia-based hotel REIT, formed in 2007. It has a portfolio of approximately 29,000 rooms in 220 hotels in 87 markets across 37 states. Its portfolio includes 96 Marriotts, 119 Hiltons, four Hyatts and one independent hotel. It has a market capitalization rate of $3.84 billion.From New Year’s Day through the end of February, Apple Hospitality had a total return of 7.62%. But the stock dropped nearly 16% in March, so the year-to-date return is now negative 7.75%.On March 22, van Dijkum downgraded Apple Hospitality from Buy to Neutral and lowered his previous $22 price target to $17, a decline of 22%. The stock dropped 5.86% on the day of the downgrade.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. (NASDAQ: HST) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel REIT that calls itself “the world’s largest lodging REIT.” It’s an S&amp;P 500 company that owns and operates 42,214 rooms in 78 hotels in 20 of the largest markets across the U.S. and another five hotels in Canada and Brazil. It was formed in 1993 and has a market capitalization rate of $12.63 billion.Most Host Hotels &amp; Resorts properties are upscale and luxury hotels in central business districts near airports. Its hotel brands are well-known and include Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton.Story continuesOn March 22, Van Dijkum also downgraded Host Hotels &amp; Resorts from Buy to Neutral and lowered the price target by 28% from $25 to $18. Host Hotels &amp; Resorts dropped 4.86% following the downgrade.Sunstone Hotel Investors Inc. (NYSE: SHO) is an Aliso Viejo, California-based hotel REIT that owns and operates 15 hotels in upscale areas of Florida, California, Hawaii and three other states as well as Washington, D.C. Its portfolio includes hotels by Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott and Four Seasons.On Feb. 22, Sunstone Hotel Investors reported fourth-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $0.26 beat the analyst estimates of $0.19 and was a huge increase over FFO of $0.09 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue of $244.14 million was ahead of the consensus of $227.51 million and a 40.4% increase over revenue of $173.89 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.Sunstone Hotel Investors was up an outstanding 27.87% in January but year to date is now negative 4.34%. The loss in March is over 15%.On March 23, Van Dijkum downgraded Sunstone Hotel Investors from Neutral to Sell, dropping the prior price target 25% from $12 to $9. Sunstone Hotel dropped 5.54% throughout the day after the downgrade was announced.So, what’s going on in the hotel industry?After a busy holiday season, hotels and resorts are reporting slightly weaker and mixed results. The following are the metrics for the hotel industry as of March 11 (percentage change from comparable weeks in 2022, 2019):Occupancy: 64.7% (+2.8%, -7.5%)Average daily rate (ADR): $158.20 (+8.1%, +16.6%)Revenue per available room (RevPAR): $102.38 (+11.1%, +7.8%)Occupancy rates are still not back to pre-COVID-19 levels, but inflation has forced hotels to charge higher rates. That has made the ADR and RevPAR numbers look good, but with higher costs, the hotels are not necessarily faring better.While fourth-quarter earnings were pretty good for many hotel REITs, forward guidance has been weaker, with companies acknowledging pressures that are coming from increased overall expenses and problems with renovations. Because Wall Street looks ahead, weaker guidance is not what investors want to hear.Concerns about the hotel industry are like those of other REIT subsectors — that higher inflation will temper the travel plans of many businesses and families, that borrowing money for new hotel investments will be more difficult and that maintenance, salaries and construction costs are all elevated from pre-pandemic levels.Investors can look for more downgrades in the hotel REITs to come over the next few weeks.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. A counter cyclical stock is a term used to describe the shares of a company that operates in an industry or sector that typically experiences financial performance that is inversely correlated to the overall state of the economy. This means that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the general economic trend. During times of economic downturn or recession, the stock price of a counter cyclical company tends to increase, while during times of economic expansion, it tends to decrease in value. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern for the global economy. Although there have been some recent positive developments, the recovery is expected to be moderate over the next two years. The outlook is fragile, and there are many risks that could lead to a decline in economic activity. The uncertainty created by the war could have a severe impact on trade. Additionally, there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities, particularly in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. Although there has been a decline in headline inflation, it remains high and could persist for a more extended period. The global economy experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with a rate of 3.2%, which was more than 1 percentage point lower than the expected rate at the end of 2021. The main reasons for this were the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting cost-of-living crisis in several countries. OECD predicts that growth will continue to be lower than expected in 2023 and 2024.Against the current economic backdrop, investors who used to have portfolios focused on growth are actively seeking stocks that typically perform well during times of economic downturns and slower growth. These types of stocks, such as PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), are known as counter cyclical stocks and tend to perform better during recessions.Story continuesOur Methodology The companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for this list, including discount retailers, tobacco firms, agriculture and food businesses, as well as healthcare and insurance firms. We chose the top counter cyclical stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Don't Miss: 14 Best Stocks to Buy Before the 2023 Recession Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashBest Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now11. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the biggest tobacco and cigarette companies in the world. Demand for tobacco increases when consumers are facing higher stress, unemployment, and financial constraints during economic slowdowns. On March 9, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.27 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 11, to shareholders of record on March 23. On March 1, UBS upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $116, up from $106. The firm predicts a growth acceleration in the shipment of heated tobacco products in mature markets due to Iluma, and appreciates the company's ""strong cash flow"" in the combustible business. Despite Iluma's current margin dilution, UBS suggests that new product launches will generate immediate volume and share growth, with scale benefits to be realized in the second half of 2023. The launch of Bonds for low-end markets and U.S. IQOS in 2024 is expected to further enhance Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s status as the ""best-in-class"" in the tobacco industry.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was part of 47 hedge fund portfolios, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 24.25 million shares worth $2.45 billion. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”10. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), an American agribusiness and food company, is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to watch. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19. Effective from March 15, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) replaced Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) in the S&amp;P 500.On February 9, Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $115, down from $127. The company topped consensus estimates but issued initial 2023 guidance below Street expectations, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. On February 16, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend, a 4.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.44. The dividend is payable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. In 2023, the company announced its 61st consecutive annual dividend increase, making it a reliable dividend king. On March 20, Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but reduced its price target on the shares from $63 to $60. The firm believes that there is a growing possibility of economic challenges ahead for the consumer staples industry. As a result, Deutsche Bank is becoming more worried about the potential risks to the company's future financial performance across much of its coverage.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 400 million shares worth $25.4 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the biggest American discount retailers. On March 16, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.96, beating market estimates by $0.02. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) also reiterated its plans to execute 3,170 real estate projects in fiscal 2023, including 1,050 new store openings, 2,000 remodels, and 120 store relocations. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to monitor. On March 17, Deutsche Bank increased its estimated price on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) shares from $248 to $249 and maintained a Buy rating following the release of the company's Q4 results. According to the firm, it seems that the market underestimated the expected performance of the company in 2023, which is now anticipated to be more heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. Additionally, Deutsche Bank suggests that the decrease in planned share buybacks may be due in part to higher levels of capital expenditures.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), and Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 788,664 shares worth $194.20 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) contributed to performance in the second quarter following the report of first quarter earnings that were above expectations. Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale worldwide. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The dividend is distributable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to watch. According to Morgan Stanley's recent survey, Walmart+ has 18.4 million members, which is equivalent to 14.3% of U.S. households. This figure is slightly higher than the previous survey and almost the same as the record high of 18.6 million members in September 2022. The firm believes that there is still room for more growth in Walmart+ based on the actual number of members and the number of respondents who are very likely to join. Morgan Stanley recommends buying Walmart shares and reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $160 on March 7. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 66 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7 million shares worth $993.2 million.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) operates membership warehouses and discount retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Australia, Spain, France, Iceland, China, and Taiwan. For the twenty-six week period ended February 26, 2023, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)’s net sales were $116.06 billion, an increase of 7.1% from $108.39 billion last year.On March 10, Roth MKM increased Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)’s price target from $484 to $494 and maintained a Neutral rating on the shares. The company is experiencing difficulties with its comp sales growth slowing down due to inflation and possible competitive pressures affecting its gross margins. Roth MKM informed investors in a research note that even though Costco is gaining market share and may increase its membership fees, the stock's value is still too high, considering the limited potential earnings upside in FY23.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 937,521 shares worth about $428 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to invest in. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:20 Most Advanced Countries in the World in 202325 Best Stocks for Dividends11 Best Space Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Valero Energy Corp., Roper Technologies, Inc. and American Electric Power Co., Inc.

The company offers the most diversified refinery base in the industry, with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.Importantly, Valero is best placed to reap profits from solid refining margins, mainly owing to the strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located in the Gulf Coast area, from where there is easy access to the export facilities.The Gulf Coast presence helped Valero expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Valero recently reported strong fourth-quarter results due to increased refinery throughput volumes.

Strong cash flow generation supports Roper’s shareholder-friendly efforts.However, supply-chain issues remain a challenge for Roper. The rising cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company’s bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds are added concerns.(You can read the full research report on Roper Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of American Electric Power have declined -11.8% over the past year against the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry’s decline of -12.9%.

94,60fbddfa-6652-3f66-b2a6-c05d1ddd515a,PPG,2023-03-28,"What Is PPG Industries, Inc.'s (NYSE:PPG) Share Price Doing?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-inc-nyse-ppg-191146165.html,1679944306,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$137 and falling to the lows of US$122. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether PPG Industries' current trading price of US$125 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at PPG Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for PPG Industries What's The Opportunity In PPG Industries?According to my valuation model, PPG Industries seems to be fairly priced at around 11% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy PPG Industries today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $140.40, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that PPG Industries’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will PPG Industries generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 90% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for PPG Industries. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PPG’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PPG, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing PPG Industries at this point in time.

96,e0b44b8b-f358-420c-84e3-eed64af182c7,GS,2023-03-28,Charts: Three key readings to track financial market stress,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charts-three-key-readings-to-track-financial-market-stress-201441517.html,1679948081,STORY,"['8301.T', 'BAC', '^VIX', 'VXX', 'HYG', 'SPY', 'SBNY', 'SBNYP', '^GSPC', 'IWM', 'CS', '^KRX', 'KRE', 'UBS', 'JPY=X', 'JPYUSD=X', 'WFC', 'FRC', '^VVIX', '^IXIC', 'JNK', 'WAL', 'WAL-PA', '^DJI', '^RUT', 'SIVB', 'QQQ', 'EURJPY=X', 'EUR=X', 'GS', 'XLF']","[Stocks were mixed to start the week on Monday, though this action kept the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a quarterly gain north of 10% while the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 3% to start the year.Meanwhile, the Treasury market has also seen a huge rally with the 10-year yield falling from a high north of 4% in early March to as low as 3.38% last week.These moves come as the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points last week and investors weigh the Fed's latest actions and attempt to assess the odds of further bank failures and even recession.For investors looking tracking financial stress to watch going forward, here are the key charts to watch.1. Rising Market Volatility — YF Tickers: ^VIX, ^VVIX, ^MOVEThe VIX (^VIX), also known as the ""fear index,"" measures investors' expectations of future (or ""implied"") volatility over the next 30 days in the S&amp;P 500. It is calculated based on transactions in options on the index itself.In general, higher stock index volatility tends to accompany selloffs, indicating ""fear"" in the market. Conversely, lower volatility is usually associated with stock market ralliesJust as the VIX measures stock market volatility, the VVIX (^VVIX) measures the volatility of the VIX itself. Sometimes, it will perk up and serve as an advance warning of moves in the underlying VIX.The ICE BofAML MOVE Index (^MOVE) index is the bond market's answer to the VIX. It is calculated once each day after the close, and so unlike the VIX the MOVE Index does not give intraday readings of volatility.Pro tip: An extreme upside VIX spike will usually accompany a huge down day in stocks — but that won't necessarily mark the low in stocks. If the VIX remains elevated, stocks can continue to drop as the VIX goes sideways, or even down itself. As the pros say, ""Don't confuse pace with direction.""Current status: The VIX shot above the 30 level last week as concerns over bank stress grew — only to crash Monday and Tuesday last week and remain lower into the news week, trading near 21.Story continuesThe MOVE index peaked at nearly 200 on March 20 — higher than the pandemic highs — and after cooling mid-week, surged on Friday amid investor fears over Deutsche Bank (DB), finishing the week above 170.A trader watches prices in the VIX pit at the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. exchange on February 6, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)2. Haven Flows — YF Tickers: JPY=X, EURJPY=XForeign exchange pairs measure the change in two currencies relative to one another. Typically, the ratio reflects differences in short-term interest rates between the two countries or areas.Relatively higher-rate countries tend to attract investment capital, while lower-rate jurisdictions are sources of funds to be borrowed and invested elsewhere — generally referred to as the carry trade.However, in times of stress, a premium is placed on developed market currencies — especially the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. Money flows from risky areas into these safe havens in what are called ""haven flows.""Over the last 30 years, the Bank of Japan has maintained the easiest monetary policy among developed nations. As a result, a favored macro trade is to borrow money in Japan, then invest it in the bonds of a higher-interest rate economy.Traders have historically looked to the EURJPY pair — pitting the euro against the yen — as a barometer of global risk tolerance. If the euro rises against the yen, the theory says riskier investments are in favor as money flows into Europe from Japan. Conversely, the pair often heads south when global risk surfaces and funds need a relatively ""safe"" home.Pitting the dollar against the yen is also useful to use as an early warning sign. With U.S. rates far above those in Japan, big flows into the yen — evidenced by a lower USDJPY — can be a red flag for overall risk tolerance when this pair drops quickly.Pro tip: The order of the currencies in their abbreviated ticker is made by convention, which can be confusing. For instance, the euro versus the dollar is typically expressed as EURUSD. Notably, Yahoo Finance omits the ""USD"" in forex tickers if it occurs first and appends an ""=X"" to all pairs. For instance, the Yahoo Finance ticker for USDJPY is JPY=X, for EURJPY, the ticker is EURJPY=X.Current status: Neither the euro nor the dollar is showing signs of sustained strong haven flows into the yen — though the yen has net strengthened since the SVB failure.3. Deteriorating Credit Markets — YF Tickers: HYG, JNKInvestors closely watch corporate credit markets for signs of weakness, as they are often first to show cracks in risk appetite. Corporate bonds are measured in how wide or tight their rates of interest are from the corresponding tenors of government debt. But stock investors don't need a fancy terminal to measure stress in corporate bonds.ETFs that track corporate credit — like the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) — can do the job.The ETFs track prices on a selection of corporate bonds, which move inversely to yield. In times of stress, when yields surge higher, the ETFs will nosedive, as they did during the pandemic and other periods of stress.Back in the early days of the pandemic, the Fed took the then-unprecedented step to support corporate credit markets by buying these two ETFs directly.If these ETFs do plummet again, watch out for quick, outsized reversals to the upside, which can indicate the Fed has taken action to support markets.Current status: HYG and JNK aren't currently reflecting or forecasting extreme market stress.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
97,a355ca11-4f13-3f9a-bc85-a95157e805e2,SLB,2023-03-28,Brokers Suggest Investing in Schlumberger (SLB): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-schlumberger-slb-133001884.html,1679923801,STORY,['SLB'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Schlumberger (SLB).Schlumberger currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.15, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 17 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.15 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 17 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 14 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 82.4% and 17.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for SLBBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for SLBCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Schlumberger here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Schlumberger, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is SLB a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Schlumberger, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.02.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Schlumberger. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Schlumberger.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&amp;P 500.Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.Story continuesThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers. Moreover, these companies also pay out dividends regularly to shareholders, which helps them stay afloat during market downturns. Some companies with solid financials are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which is evident through their decades-long dividend growth histories. In this article, we will discuss the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy.12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Nowmaxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries.

Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based diversified manufacturing company that designs various products that belong to the home and automobile industries.

The collective value of these stakes is over $25 million. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.11. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is an American sportswear and footwear retailer which has operations in over 28 countries. Evercore ISI upgraded the stock to Outperform in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $60. The firm appreciated the company's strong business model.Foot Locker, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”10.

100,0539695b-5c62-31e0-a8e3-b2cf480ebb47,AIG,2023-03-28,Those who invested in American International Group (NYSE:AIG) three years ago are up 101%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-american-international-group-110046010.html,1680001246,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 25% in the last quarter. But don't let that distract from the very nice return generated over three years. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 85% in that time.So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for American International Group To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, American International Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 55% per year. The average annual share price increase of 23% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 3.41 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how American International Group has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of American International Group, it has a TSR of 101% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that American International Group shareholders are down 24% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 14%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - American International Group has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.Of course American International Group may not be the best stock to buy.

103,a82d86d9-3e94-38ae-a1d5-478aa654ae6c,HOLX,2023-03-28,Here's Why You Should Retain Inogen (INGN) Stock for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-inogen-ingn-142202292.html,1679926922,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Inogen, Inc. INGN is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its high prospects in the portable oxygen concentrator (POC) space. The optimism is led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and a strong product portfolio. Headwinds resulting from stiff competition and foreign exchange fluctuations are major downsides.Over the past year, th Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 60.9% compared with the 16.3% decline of the industry and 14.2% fall of the S&amp;P 500.This renowned provider of POCs has a market capitalization of $285.1 million. The company projects 40.1% growth for 2024 and expects to witness continued improvements in its business. Inogen surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an earnings surprise of 44.2%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.High Prospects in the POC Space: We are optimistic about the POCs’ superiority over conventional oxygen therapy (known as the delivery model). POCs provide unlimited oxygen supply anywhere, thereby enhancing patient independence and mobility. Management at Inogen expects this to have a positive impact on its industry and POC adoption.Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Inogen’s expanding product portfolio. The company provides oxygen concentrator solutions for portable and stationary use. On the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call in February, management confirmed that in December 2022, Inogen received the FDA’s clearance for Rove 4. The company’s management anticipates the U.S. launch in the back half of 2023.Strong Q4 Results: Inogen’s robust year-over-year uptick overall, as well as rental and sales revenues in fourth-quarter 2022, buoys optimism. The strength in domestic and international business-to-business sales was encouraging. On the earnings call, management confirmed that it plans to drive further differentiation for Inogen and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with anticipated new product launches in 2023 in the United States and Europe following regulatory clearances. This raises our optimism about Inogen.Story continuesDownsidesStiff Competition: The long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) market is a highly competitive industry. Inogen competes with several manufacturers and distributors of POC and providers of other LTOT solutions, such as home delivery of oxygen tanks or cylinders. Given the relatively straightforward regulatory path in the oxygen therapy device manufacturing market, Inogen expects that the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future.Forex Woes: Inogen generates a significant portion of its revenues from the international market. Management expects international revenues to remain lumpy owing to the timing and size of the distributor.

109,e17ab302-edd6-31b1-9c6e-02134bff634a,AMGN,2023-03-28,Amgen-Sanofi patent case divides makers of antibody drugs,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-sanofi-patent-case-divides-225101054.html,1679957461,STORY,"['SAN.PA', 'AMGN', 'REGN', 'SNY']","[By Patrick WingroveMarch 27 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc's battle with Sanofi and Regeneron at the U.S. Supreme Court over its cholesterol drug Repatha on Monday has some drugmakers hoping a ruling will reshape U.S. patent law and competition among companies that make antibody medicines.In the dispute with Sanofi and partner Regeneron, whose cholesterol-lowering monoclonal antibody drug Praluent works in a similar way as Repatha, Amgen wants the court to rule on how much information it and others need to disclose when describing inventions in patents.The court has been asked to weigh in on the validity of two patents for Repatha, which garnered sales of $1.5 billion in 2022 for Amgen, to determine whether Praluent infringes them.The Supreme Court could maintain the legal status quo with its decision – expected by the end of June – which would keep the antibodies market open to numerous players. It could also decide to make it easier for drug companies to muscle competitors out of some market areas with broad patents that cover more ground.Market research consultant Global Market Insights said the monoclonal antibodies market, which includes big-selling treatments for cancer, high cholesterol, COVID-19 and many other conditions, was worth $181 billion in 2021.Under U.S. patent law, drug companies can get 20 years of market exclusivity for publishing their inventions, but must describe them clearly enough so skilled people can copy and use them without too much trial and error. Companies that describe inventions too broadly run the risk of having their patents canceled.Amgen, supported at the Supreme Court by AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb and GSK, wants the high court to rule that it can use “genus claims,” which describe a set of characteristics or features common to a group, to describe what Repatha does in broad language.If successful, Amgen would claim ownership of all antibodies that inhibit the PCSK9 protein, the mechanism of action for both Repatha and Praluent. Other companies could then do the same with their own antibody treatments in other disease areas.Story continuesSanofi and Regeneron, backed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Eli Lilly &lt; LLY.N&gt; and at least six other companies, have argued that broad patent protection like Amgen is seeking is not allowed by U.S. patent law.Patent lawyer Irena Royzman of Kramer Levin said the companies taking Sanofi and Regeneron’s side are doing so because a win would allow them to keep bringing competitive drugs to market more easily.“The J&amp;Js, Eli Lillys and Pfizers recognize that if a particular company controls an entire therapeutic target, we’re all the poorer for it,” Royzman said.The case might also affect newer technologies used in medicine, such as CRISPR gene editing and messenger RNA, she said.Amgen's side says if forced to only claim the structural components of their drugs in patents, competitors could easily design around them, disincentivizing investment in monoclonal antibodies.Baird analyst Brian Skorney said the immediate financial impact of the decision is limited to the companies involved, although it could give some an advantage in future litigation.Regeneron made $130 million from Praluent in the U.S. last year, and Sanofi collected $400 million in the rest of the world.U.S. courts have so far sided with Sanofi. A Washington, D.C.-based federal appeals court that covers U.S. patent cases invalidated Amgen's patent claiming ownership of all PCSK9 inhibitors as a whole in 2021.Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron in 2014. Both drugs use lab-made antibodies to block PCSK9 proteins that inhibit removal of bad LDL cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve that result through different chemical combinations.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of Repatha worldwide in 2022. Meanwhile, Sanofi and Regeneron last year sold $530 million worth worldwide of their rival drug Praluent, which works by a similar mechanism as Repatha.Amgen has sought to patent a group of antibodies that help reduce so-called ""bad"" cholesterol, though its patents disclosed only a subset of antibodies it claimed. At issue is whether a valid patent can cover all the members of an identified group, or if it is limited to only those members of the group specified by the patent owner.Amgen's lawyer, Jeffrey Lamken, and Sanofi's attorney, Paul Clement, both said a ruling against the company they represent would hurt innovation. Lamken argued that companies would not invest in research if they cannot receive patents for what they invent.Clement urged the court not to squeeze out competition from the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs.Story continues""We're better off with two competing independently developed therapies,"" Clement said.Clement said allowing Amgen's broad patents would freeze out other companies.The justices focused their questions on trying to determine how many antibodies Amgen's patents actually covered, whether dozens, hundreds or even millions. Amgen has argued that a patent need only to ""enable skilled artisans to 'make and use' the invention,"" not account for the full range of possible forms the invention might take.Amgen faced tough questions about why its patents described 26 specific examples of antibodies when the scope of its patents would cover a larger number.""Several times you referred to invention of the antibodies, and I think I'm somewhat confused as to exactly what your invention is. You said it's not just the 26 but it definitely is not millions. So what is it exactly?"" conservative Justice Clarence Thomas asked Lamken. ""We're not talking about what has been invented with any particular precision.""Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wondered how the company has ""satisfied enablement"" by claiming a patent covering a large group of antibodies but focusing its patents on a smaller group.If the number claimed in a patent could reach the millions, Jackson asked Amgen's lawyer, ""You think that gives others enough notice as to what you've claimed?""Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron in 2014 for patent infringement over Praluent. Both drugs use laboratory-made antibodies to block a protein called PCSK9 that inhibits the removal of bad cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve this result through different chemical combinations.Bad cholesterol, known LDL, can cause a buildup of plaque in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals nationwide, invalidated Amgen's patents that covered PCSK9-blocking drugs as a group.President Joe Biden's administration, arguing in support of Sanofi, told the justices that Amgen had not disclosed the information needed to make to make its patents valid.A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June.(Reporting by John Kruzel and Andrew Chung, with additional reporting by Blake Brittain; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

Delegates from the group say privately that an online meeting of key ministers on Monday is set to maintain this position.With turmoil in the banking sector affecting the economic outlook and sanctions on Russia creating uncertainty about supply, there’s no need to deviate from the current plan, the delegates said, asking not to be named because the information is private.Fourteen traders and analysts polled by Bloomberg also unanimously predicted no change from the OPEC+ Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which has the power to call an emergency meeting if it thinks a change in production policy is necessary.“I suspect they’ll be keeping their heads down and eyes open,” said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group and a former White House official. “It’s too soon for any firm conclusions that would trigger a recommendation to call a ministerial meeting before June 4, much less adjust quota policy.”Crude prices slumped to a 15-month low last week on fears that the economic fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the takeover of Credit Suisse Group AG would hurt oil demand. But futures have since recovered, trading near $78 a barrel in London on Tuesday and easing any pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to shore up markets.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has been particularly clear that current output targets shouldn’t be changed.

Even the scaled-down project will be profitable and will work, the company and analysts say.One of the reasons why ConocoPhillips is betting on Alaska while others are leaving is that ConocoPhillips’ chief executive, Ryan Lance, has worked in the state for over a decade and knows the energy and political landscape there, The Wall Street Journal notes.Lance, who began his career in Alaska and has worked there for 14 years, believes that Alaska can still yield a lot of oil, for a long period of time, as the world will need oil and gas for the foreseeable future.At the same time, Lance expects U.S. crude oil production to plateau this decade.“The plateau is on the horizon,” he said at CERAWeek earlier this month, as carried by the Financial Times.“The world is going back to what we had in the ‘70s and the ‘80s unless we do something to change that trajectory,” Lance said, referring to the time when OPEC had a tight grip over the global oil market.According to the executive, OPEC’s market share will jump from around 30% now to close to 50% in the future, in which additional supply comes from OPEC and U.S. shale growth plateaus.ConocoPhillips bets on its newest plan in Alaska to boost production by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd). This could nearly double the company’s output in Alaska— ConocoPhillips’ current production there is just below 200,000 bpd.  Related: Oil Prices Jump 5% On Easing Banking FearsConocoPhillips is Alaska’s largest crude oil producer and the largest owner of exploration leases, with around 1.6 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2021.Story continuesWith other majors leaving, ConocoPhillips could further strengthen its position in the state. BP, for example, sold its upstream business in Alaska to Hilcorp for $5.6 billion three years ago. ConocoPhillips has yet to progress the Willow project to a final investment decision. Willow is set to deliver between $8 billion to $17 billion in new revenue for the federal government, the state of Alaska, and North Slope Borough communities, the company says.But environmentalists – who slammed the Biden Administration for “carbon-bombing” its environmental progress and legacy by approving Willow – have already started filing lawsuits to stop the project.Raena Garcia, Fossil Fuels and Lands Campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said that “President Biden’s approval of the Willow project is a colossal and reprehensible stain on his environmental legacy.” In the days following Willow’s approval, two separate lawsuits by environmental groups were filed. Alaska Wilderness League was among six groups that filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court challenging the Biden administration’s approval of the Willow project, seeking a preliminary injunction in the case. Another group of campaigners also filed a lawsuit to stop the project, saying, “We can only hope that the court sees this for what it is: another unlawful, faulty, and disastrous decision that must be stopped.”Meanwhile, consultancy Wood Mackenzie says that even with a three-well pad development instead of the five-pad project ConocoPhillips had sought, Willow would be economically viable.“With Willow joining other projects like Pikka, new pads at Milne Point, Narwhal, Nuna and Coyote, we see production returning to 700,000 b/d by 2030, levels last seen in 2008,” said Mark Oberstoetter, head of Americas (non-L48) upstream for Wood Mackenzie.Last year, Alaska’s field production of crude oil averaged 437,000 bpd, according to EIA data. Alaska saw a record production of over 2 million bpd in the late 1980s. “Without production from Willow and these other new projects, the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (“TAPS”) would eventually run into low flow issues, jeopardising all production coming from the North Slope,” WoodMac’s Oberstoetter added.In addition, Wood Mackenzie projections suggest Willow’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity would be lower than other Alaska projects, and lower than many of the current sources of U.S. oil imports.

119,18b95c5d-6778-3b23-81ed-7c0b615facfd,M,2023-03-28,Battle For Iraqi Oil Heats Up After Iran-Saudi Deal,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battle-iraqi-oil-heats-iran-230000230.html,1679958000,STORY,['M'],"[Iraq’s crude oil production has been stuck between the 4.0-4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) level since 2016, with a mean average of about 4.5 million bpd during that period, but it could relatively straightforwardly produce 12 million bpd – way more than Saudi Arabia’s true crude oil production average of 8.2 million from 1973 to last Friday. Key elements needed for Iraq to increase its crude oil production to this elevated level are contained in the US$27 billion four-pronged deal agreed with TotalEnergies but there are now doubts that all or part of this deal will proceed as planned. Following the recent landmark resumption of relations between Iran - which retains enormous influence over Iraq through political, military and economic proxies - and Saudi Arabia, brokered by China (and Russia to a lesser degree), it was made clear to Iran it should do all it could to stop major deals being done in Iraq by Western companies. Specifically, a source who works closely with the European Union’s energy security apparatus exclusively told OilPrice.com last week, Iran was told by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin that: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq – and closer to the new Iran-Saudi axis - the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise”.To recap on the TotalEnergies’ proposed deal that, up until the signing of the relationship resumption deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, was going ahead as planned. The first of these projects – and crucial in enabling Iraq to reach its longer-term crude oil production targets of 7 million barrels per day (bpd), and then 9 million bpd and then perhaps 12 million bpd, as analysed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets – was to have been the completion of the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP). The project, which would see an initial investment of US$3 billion in its first phase, involves taking and treating seawater from the Persian Gulf and then transporting it via pipelines to oil production facilities to maintain pressure in oil reservoirs to optimise the longevity and output of fields. The long-delayed plan for the CSSP is that it initially supplies around 6 million bpd of water to at least five southern Basra fields and one in Maysan Province, and is then expanded for use in other fields. The second of the projects is also a matter of high importance and urgent necessity: to collect and refine associated natural gas that is currently burned off at the five southern Iraq oilfields of West Qurna 2, Majnoon, Tuba, Luhais, and Artawi. TotalEnergies was to have provided US$2 billion in the first phase of the project for the building of the processing plant to do this, with initial comments from Iraq’s Oil Ministry last year highlighting that the plant is expected to produce 300 million cubic feet of gas per day (mcf/d) and double that after a second phase of development. Iraqi Oil Minister, Ihsan Abdul Jabbar, stated last year that the gas produced from this second TotalEnergies project in the south will help Iraq to cut its gas imports from Iran.Story continuesRelated: WTI Breaks $70 As Kurdistan Halts Oil ExportsTotalEnergies already has ongoing experience of working across Iraq, holding a 22.5 percent stake in the Halfaya oil field in Missan province in the south and an 18 percent stake in the Sarsang exploration block in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in the north. This gives it very specific operational experience of working on the ground in Iraq, which would also have enabled it to increase crude oil output from the Artawi oil field, which is the third of the four projects to which it was committed. According to earlier comments from Iraq’s Oil Ministry, TotalEnergies would help to boost output from the Artawi oilfield to 210,000 bpd of crude oil, up from the current circa-85,000 bpd. Successfully capturing associated gas rather than flaring it will also allow Iraq to revive the also long-stalled US$11-billion Nebras petrochemicals project with Royal Dutch Shell, which if it went ahead in a professional way could be completed within five years and would generate estimated profits of up to US$100 billion for Iraq within its 35-year initial contract period. The last of the four projects that were to have been undertaken by the French company would be the construction and operation of a 1,000-megawatt solar energy plant in Iraq.So, where is this deal now? “Highly fluid - China wants all the big [oil and gas] reservoirs in the Middle East,” said the EU energy source. “It secured Iran’s with the 25-year deal [Strategic Cooperation Agreement, first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject], which also gave it the chance to leverage its influence more into Iraq’s [oil and gas] reservoirs as well, and now it’s got Saudi Arabia’s too, to add to Russia’s – that’s a lot of oil and gas to control,” he concluded.Indeed, in the oil sphere, China now has effective control of two out of three top oil crude oil exporters – Russia and Saudi Arabia (with the other being the U.S, itself). In addition, China, via Saudi Arabia’s leadership position in OPEC, has considerable influence over that organisation’s oil as well. Whatever OPEC says, it is a cartel in all the ways that matter - organisationally, operationally, and in terms of its collective resources’ power. OPEC was specifically mandated upon its foundation in 1960 to ‘co-ordinate and unify the petroleum policies’ of all of its member states – effectively fixing oil prices, just like a cartel. OPEC’s cartel-like appearance is further enhanced by the facts that its members account for around 40 percent of the world’s crude oil output, about 60 percent of the total petroleum traded internationally from their oil exports and just over 80 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.In the gas sphere, the nearest equivalent to OPEC – although currently not as powerful – is what has been referred to as ‘Gas OPEC’, which is the Gulf Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). Together, Russia, Iran, and Qatar – and Qatar and Iran share the world’s biggest gas field (the North Field/South Pars reservoir) - account for just under 60 percent of the world’s gas reserves, and they were the three countries that founded the GECF. The GECF’s membership now comprises 11 members control over 71 percent of global gas reserves, 44 percent of its marketed production, 53 percent of its gas pipelines, and 57 percent of its LNG exports. Around one year ago, foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, and the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – which has considerable overlap with OPEC and the GECF - were arriving in Beijing for a five-day visit to push ahead on negotiations over the China-GCC Free Trade Agreement (FTA). At these meetings, the principal topic of conversation was to finally seal the China-GCC FTA and a “deeper strategic cooperation in a region where U.S. dominance is showing signs of retreat”.China does not only want to control all the major oil reservoirs in the Middle East but also to get greatly beneficial pricing on everything produced from them. By dint of the 25-year Strategic Cooperation Agreement with Iran it has been able to do this on precisely the terms laid down in my original exclusive piece on the deal. China has been able to use this as the basis for deals done with Iraq, given Tehran’s strong and enduring influence over Baghdad. Specifically, the deals China wants involves 25-year contracts but – critically – ones that only officially start two years after the signing date, so allowing China to recoup more profits on average per year and less upfront investment. The per barrel payments to China for oil would be the higher of either the mean average of the 18-month spot price for crude oil produced, or the past six months’ mean average price. It would also involve at least a 10 percent discount to China for at least five years on the value of the oil it recovered. For gas recovery, the basic terms are the same, but in terms of pricing China wants whichever developer that takes the lead to receive a 30 percent discount to the lowest mean one-year average market price at the key gas pricing hubs for the gas it captured.By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:North American LNG Projects Plagued By Price VolatilityLatin America’s Bid To Challenge China’s Dominance In The Lithium MarketKurdistan’s 400,000-Bpd Oil Exports Still Shut-In As Talks With Iraq FailRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The company currently owns and operates casino hotel resort properties in Las Vegas, and in Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.Strong Growth TrajectoryWynn Resorts, one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry, is well poised to grow strategically. Given its strong brand name, Wynn Resorts is better positioned to command a premium rate relative to its peers in the gaming and lodging industry. Moreover, the addition of Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts, makes it an initiative placed in the right direction. The company reconfigured its casino and changed the casino loyalty program. Also, it emphasized on adding incremental parking, food and beverage and entertainment amenities. With group business returning back, the initiatives are likely to benefit the company in the upcoming periods. The company stated that it would upgrade Encore Boston Harbor to be the top-performing Casino in the northeast.Sports Betting to Drive GrowthThe company is focusing on sport betting expansion to drive growth.

127,f6c0455f-9b11-336c-a6ec-edaf2b7772d2,NEE,2023-03-28,20 Biggest Power Generation Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-power-generation-companies-145823295.html,1679929103,STORY,"['NEE-PR', 'EXCVV', 'SO', 'GE', 'KEP']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest power generation companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest power generation companies in the world.Consistent generation and supply of power is absolutely integral to the development of any economy, and is one of the primary factors behind industrialization and the growth of Western economies. While just the 20 biggest power generation companies in the world earn annual revenues exceeding $2 trillion, their indirect contribution is even more significant as power supply is the backbone for the vast majority of industries across all sectors, across the world.Despite its importance, 2022 was not a very good year for the power and utility sector generally, but in the U.S., sales still continued to increase as demand jumped with the country mostly recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, even though revenues increased significantly because of the aforementioned demand, costs increased even more as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to energy supplies being depleted and prices more than doubling. Meanwhile, grid resilience is continuing to be tested from catastrophic climate events, one of the biggest global risks for 2023. To combat this issue, the biggest players in the industry, including some of the biggest power generation companies in the world, improved their reserves, deployed microgrids and worked on improving their infrastructure as well.25 biggest power generation companies in the worldPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashWhile these developments are likely to increase further in 2023 and even beyond, it is important to remember that as the Russian Ukraine war continues with no idea of when hostilities will cease, electricity prices are likely to stay high in 2023 while inflation and supply chain issues will add to the challenges that the industry is facing right now. Other issues such as extreme weather events and even cybersecurity will require innovation to ensure that power generation and its supply remains stable.Story continuesAs is true for most industries, the investment viability of the biggest power generation companies in the world doesn't just depend on revenue and profits but Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), which is continuing to gain momentum, especially with regards to decarbonization practices as companies try to identify societal and environmental disrupters while focus on resolving them. While such disclosures in the U.S. aren't uniform across power generation companies, this will also change in 2023, after a new SEC proposal in March 2022 regarding certain public disclosures.Another important consideration for the power generation industry is the requirement of a shift from using non-renewable resources to renewable resources. Companies creating clean energy have a lot of incentives, grants and subsidies from the government. This is why NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), the biggest renewables energy company by market cap, is also the biggest power generation company by market cap. According its Q4 2022 earnings call, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) CEO stated ""In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders."" This just helps signify the important of renewable energy production in this industry.The biggest power generation companies in the world are dominated by state-owned companies which earn significant amounts of revenue. To determine our list, we ranked them based on trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue and the latest market, both obtained from Yahoo Finance. We assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In case of private companies, we determined their revenue from Fortune Global 500, and ranked them based on revenue alone.

Moreover, related jobs in the sector are expected to grow by more than 50% to 14 million by 2030. Therefore, investing in the best energy stocks in the renewables space makes sense, considering the massive upside these companies offer.Industry experts are incredibly bullish on the sector. Most expect double-digit compound annual growth in solar and wind power installations over the coming decade. Furthermore, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act enacted by the federal government last year has effectively transformed the market’s outlook for the energy sector. This was furthered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with plenty of catalysts leading investors to shift their focus toward green energy and away from fossil fuels.With that said, let’s look at three of the best energy stocks, proving to be trailblazers in green energy production.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNEENextEra Energy$75.07CWENClearway Energy$29.80BEPBrookfield Renewable Partners$28.93NextEra Energy (NEE)Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screenSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is the top electric utility holding business in terms of market capitalization. Additionally, this company is also one of the major providers of U.S. infrastructure in this space. The company operates under two primary segments: Florida Power &amp; Light and NextEra Energy Resources.FPL caters to residential customers in Florida, generating roughly 76% of its energy from natural gas, followed by nuclear and solar. This segment reported a healthy $3.7 billion in profits in 2022, compared to $3.2 billion in 2021.NEER operates a robust renewables business spread across the U.S., generating about 50% of FPL’s sales. Moreover, the segment has proven to be even more profitable, delivering adjusted earnings of $2.441 billion in 2022, or $1.23 per share, compared to $2.206 billion in 2021.Story continuesOverall, NextEra’s business has performed impressively in a strong pricing environment. Moreover, its revenue and EBITDA growth have outpaced its 5-year average growth by double-digit margins. Additionally, with a rock-solid cash balance of $8.2 billion, the company’s consistently-growing dividend is as secure as ever.Clearway Energy (CWEN)the clearway energy (CWEN) logo on a web browser under a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comClearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) is a clean energy powerhouse, with 5,500 net megawatts (MW) in solar and wind generation projects. Impressively, the company also operates 2,500 net MW of highly-efficient natural gas facilities.Clearway’s impressive asset base has been bolstered over time by continued capital investments. The company’s focus on project that provide an effective yield of 9% or more has positioned the company as among the strongest fundamental plays in the sector.Accordingly, it should be no surprise to many that Clearway has done a remarkable job of maintaining its strong profitability profile. The company has an incredible EBITDA margin of 74.4% on a trailing-twelve-month basis. On top of that, it has generated a free cash flow margin of 64% for the year. The improvements in its bottom line are due to lower finance costs, a testament to its effective debt management. Furthermore, Clearway’s debt-to-equity ratio improved to 1.61 last year, compared to 2.62 in 2017.With its resilient liquidity position, Clearway’s dividend is well-protected. Thus, the company’s management team is now targeting annual dividend per share growth in the upper end of its guidance, at 5% to 8%, through 2026.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)The Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of a digital American flag background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) is a top-tier renewable energy play with a consistent track record of generating strong top- and bottom-line growth.Despite recent market-related headwinds, Brookfield has posted some impressive results. The company wrapped up its fourth quarter, posting more than 9.6% revenue growth, to $1.19 billion. This revenue surge coincided with a 6% increase in Brookfield’s funds-from-operations (FFO) on a year-over-year basis. For the year, BEP’s FFO rose to 8% to $1 billion, which resulted in the partnership raising its quarterly distributions to 33 cents. Thus, BEP stock now provides investors with a total annualized distribution of $1.35/unit.Brookfield has an enviable green energy capacity of 11,000 GW per year. This has been bolstered by recent orders of 3,500 MWs of new projects, taking the company’s total capacity potential to 190 GW. Hence, the company has positioned itself incredibly well to benefit from increased demand for clean energy sources.Currently, BEP stock trades at 8-times trailing twelve-month cash flow estimates, roughly 44.6% lower than its 5-year average.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) share price is up 36% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 9.2% in the last year.While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. Check out our latest analysis for Masco While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Masco was able to grow its EPS at 19% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Masco has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Masco's TSR for the last 3 years was 43%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Masco shares lost 7.2% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 13%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 6% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Masco (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.We will like Masco better if we see some big insider buys.

Moving forward, the focus will be on developing more connected experiences across channels, brands, online and in-store. Outstanding customer service and brand ambassadors are key to helping consumers gain insights and drive loyalty.Of the shoppers surveyed by Synchrony:67 percent believed a world where multiple brands created joint offers would enhance their experiences across channels42 percent of shoppers would be likely to register or participate in future experiences, where brands offer a range of connected shopping options such as an app that connects a concert ticket purchase to customer's calendar and suggests an outfit for the event and where to buy it52 percent of shoppers said they would be interested in an in-store engagement where the associate leverages crowd-sourced ratings combined with customer preferences to deliver recommendations in real time to their phoneStory continuesCuration Beats out CompetitionWhile providing a range of options to customers has always been a hallmark of best-in-class retail brands, the explosion of choice and increased opportunity has led to a heightened need for more curation and customization. Shoppers are more frequently turning to intermediaries to help guide their purchase decisions and narrow down their choices, which can have a major impact when brands don't make it through these filters.Synchrony's research found that, in the future, shoppers would like to reduce the range of available products presented to them.62 percent of shoppers surveyed believe that their shopping experience would be simpler if stores offered fewer choices81 percent expect to see a world where hyper personalization or ""just for me"" is rolled out by 203055 percent expressed an intent to use on-site personalization services if they were availableRetailers need to focus on specific categories, needs, and consumer trends to create engaging experiences that promote customer loyalty among shoppers and maintain repeat sales, the study implies.Convenience On The GoAnother major finding: while shoppers have always cared about convenience, today's shoppers are more concerned with the flexibility, access, and speed of their shopping experience. The act of shopping has become and will continue to move away from being an isolated activity, instead being embedded into other activities such as scrolling through social media, gaming, or going for a walk.64 percent of the shoppers surveyed believe that in the future shopping will not be an isolated activity, rather brands will reach them through separate but linked activities (e.g., social media activity linked to geo-location recommendations while out on a walk, metaverse brand interaction directs shopper to nearest physical location with tailored recommendations)Utilizing smart carts that integrate seamless shopping and checkouts can deliver enhanced value to shoppers. Sixty-seven percent of shoppers agreed that smart carts would enhance their lives, while 75 percent of those sampled believe that smart carts would be a possibility and popular over the next seven years.""Our study found that shopping does not happen in isolation, but rather with connected ecosystems driven by unique technologies that play a critical role for retailers seeking to meet these consumer demands."" said Florin Arghirescu, Synchrony's senior vice president and chief product officer.

Even the scaled-down project will be profitable and will work, the company and analysts say.One of the reasons why ConocoPhillips is betting on Alaska while others are leaving is that ConocoPhillips’ chief executive, Ryan Lance, has worked in the state for over a decade and knows the energy and political landscape there, The Wall Street Journal notes.Lance, who began his career in Alaska and has worked there for 14 years, believes that Alaska can still yield a lot of oil, for a long period of time, as the world will need oil and gas for the foreseeable future.At the same time, Lance expects U.S. crude oil production to plateau this decade.“The plateau is on the horizon,” he said at CERAWeek earlier this month, as carried by the Financial Times.“The world is going back to what we had in the ‘70s and the ‘80s unless we do something to change that trajectory,” Lance said, referring to the time when OPEC had a tight grip over the global oil market.According to the executive, OPEC’s market share will jump from around 30% now to close to 50% in the future, in which additional supply comes from OPEC and U.S. shale growth plateaus.ConocoPhillips bets on its newest plan in Alaska to boost production by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd). This could nearly double the company’s output in Alaska— ConocoPhillips’ current production there is just below 200,000 bpd.  Related: Oil Prices Jump 5% On Easing Banking FearsConocoPhillips is Alaska’s largest crude oil producer and the largest owner of exploration leases, with around 1.6 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2021.Story continuesWith other majors leaving, ConocoPhillips could further strengthen its position in the state. BP, for example, sold its upstream business in Alaska to Hilcorp for $5.6 billion three years ago. ConocoPhillips has yet to progress the Willow project to a final investment decision. Willow is set to deliver between $8 billion to $17 billion in new revenue for the federal government, the state of Alaska, and North Slope Borough communities, the company says.But environmentalists – who slammed the Biden Administration for “carbon-bombing” its environmental progress and legacy by approving Willow – have already started filing lawsuits to stop the project.Raena Garcia, Fossil Fuels and Lands Campaigner for Friends of the Earth, said that “President Biden’s approval of the Willow project is a colossal and reprehensible stain on his environmental legacy.” In the days following Willow’s approval, two separate lawsuits by environmental groups were filed. Alaska Wilderness League was among six groups that filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court challenging the Biden administration’s approval of the Willow project, seeking a preliminary injunction in the case. Another group of campaigners also filed a lawsuit to stop the project, saying, “We can only hope that the court sees this for what it is: another unlawful, faulty, and disastrous decision that must be stopped.”Meanwhile, consultancy Wood Mackenzie says that even with a three-well pad development instead of the five-pad project ConocoPhillips had sought, Willow would be economically viable.“With Willow joining other projects like Pikka, new pads at Milne Point, Narwhal, Nuna and Coyote, we see production returning to 700,000 b/d by 2030, levels last seen in 2008,” said Mark Oberstoetter, head of Americas (non-L48) upstream for Wood Mackenzie.Last year, Alaska’s field production of crude oil averaged 437,000 bpd, according to EIA data. Alaska saw a record production of over 2 million bpd in the late 1980s. “Without production from Willow and these other new projects, the Trans Alaska Pipeline System (“TAPS”) would eventually run into low flow issues, jeopardising all production coming from the North Slope,” WoodMac’s Oberstoetter added.In addition, Wood Mackenzie projections suggest Willow’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity would be lower than other Alaska projects, and lower than many of the current sources of U.S. oil imports.

142,18b95c5d-6778-3b23-81ed-7c0b615facfd,MA,2023-03-28,Battle For Iraqi Oil Heats Up After Iran-Saudi Deal,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/battle-iraqi-oil-heats-iran-230000230.html,1679958000,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Iraq’s crude oil production has been stuck between the 4.0-4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) level since 2016, with a mean average of about 4.5 million bpd during that period, but it could relatively straightforwardly produce 12 million bpd – way more than Saudi Arabia’s true crude oil production average of 8.2 million from 1973 to last Friday. Key elements needed for Iraq to increase its crude oil production to this elevated level are contained in the US$27 billion four-pronged deal agreed with TotalEnergies but there are now doubts that all or part of this deal will proceed as planned. Following the recent landmark resumption of relations between Iran - which retains enormous influence over Iraq through political, military and economic proxies - and Saudi Arabia, brokered by China (and Russia to a lesser degree), it was made clear to Iran it should do all it could to stop major deals being done in Iraq by Western companies. Specifically, a source who works closely with the European Union’s energy security apparatus exclusively told OilPrice.com last week, Iran was told by a very high-ranking official from the Kremlin that: “By keeping the West out of energy deals in Iraq – and closer to the new Iran-Saudi axis - the end of Western hegemony in the Middle East will become the decisive chapter in the West’s final demise”.To recap on the TotalEnergies’ proposed deal that, up until the signing of the relationship resumption deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, was going ahead as planned. The first of these projects – and crucial in enabling Iraq to reach its longer-term crude oil production targets of 7 million barrels per day (bpd), and then 9 million bpd and then perhaps 12 million bpd, as analysed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets – was to have been the completion of the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP). The project, which would see an initial investment of US$3 billion in its first phase, involves taking and treating seawater from the Persian Gulf and then transporting it via pipelines to oil production facilities to maintain pressure in oil reservoirs to optimise the longevity and output of fields. The long-delayed plan for the CSSP is that it initially supplies around 6 million bpd of water to at least five southern Basra fields and one in Maysan Province, and is then expanded for use in other fields. The second of the projects is also a matter of high importance and urgent necessity: to collect and refine associated natural gas that is currently burned off at the five southern Iraq oilfields of West Qurna 2, Majnoon, Tuba, Luhais, and Artawi. TotalEnergies was to have provided US$2 billion in the first phase of the project for the building of the processing plant to do this, with initial comments from Iraq’s Oil Ministry last year highlighting that the plant is expected to produce 300 million cubic feet of gas per day (mcf/d) and double that after a second phase of development. Iraqi Oil Minister, Ihsan Abdul Jabbar, stated last year that the gas produced from this second TotalEnergies project in the south will help Iraq to cut its gas imports from Iran.Story continuesRelated: WTI Breaks $70 As Kurdistan Halts Oil ExportsTotalEnergies already has ongoing experience of working across Iraq, holding a 22.5 percent stake in the Halfaya oil field in Missan province in the south and an 18 percent stake in the Sarsang exploration block in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in the north. This gives it very specific operational experience of working on the ground in Iraq, which would also have enabled it to increase crude oil output from the Artawi oil field, which is the third of the four projects to which it was committed. According to earlier comments from Iraq’s Oil Ministry, TotalEnergies would help to boost output from the Artawi oilfield to 210,000 bpd of crude oil, up from the current circa-85,000 bpd. Successfully capturing associated gas rather than flaring it will also allow Iraq to revive the also long-stalled US$11-billion Nebras petrochemicals project with Royal Dutch Shell, which if it went ahead in a professional way could be completed within five years and would generate estimated profits of up to US$100 billion for Iraq within its 35-year initial contract period. The last of the four projects that were to have been undertaken by the French company would be the construction and operation of a 1,000-megawatt solar energy plant in Iraq.So, where is this deal now? “Highly fluid - China wants all the big [oil and gas] reservoirs in the Middle East,” said the EU energy source. “It secured Iran’s with the 25-year deal [Strategic Cooperation Agreement, first revealed anywhere in the world in my 3 September 2019 article on the subject], which also gave it the chance to leverage its influence more into Iraq’s [oil and gas] reservoirs as well, and now it’s got Saudi Arabia’s too, to add to Russia’s – that’s a lot of oil and gas to control,” he concluded.Indeed, in the oil sphere, China now has effective control of two out of three top oil crude oil exporters – Russia and Saudi Arabia (with the other being the U.S, itself). In addition, China, via Saudi Arabia’s leadership position in OPEC, has considerable influence over that organisation’s oil as well. Whatever OPEC says, it is a cartel in all the ways that matter - organisationally, operationally, and in terms of its collective resources’ power. OPEC was specifically mandated upon its foundation in 1960 to ‘co-ordinate and unify the petroleum policies’ of all of its member states – effectively fixing oil prices, just like a cartel. OPEC’s cartel-like appearance is further enhanced by the facts that its members account for around 40 percent of the world’s crude oil output, about 60 percent of the total petroleum traded internationally from their oil exports and just over 80 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves.In the gas sphere, the nearest equivalent to OPEC – although currently not as powerful – is what has been referred to as ‘Gas OPEC’, which is the Gulf Exporting Countries Forum (GECF). Together, Russia, Iran, and Qatar – and Qatar and Iran share the world’s biggest gas field (the North Field/South Pars reservoir) - account for just under 60 percent of the world’s gas reserves, and they were the three countries that founded the GECF. The GECF’s membership now comprises 11 members control over 71 percent of global gas reserves, 44 percent of its marketed production, 53 percent of its gas pipelines, and 57 percent of its LNG exports. Around one year ago, foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, and the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – which has considerable overlap with OPEC and the GECF - were arriving in Beijing for a five-day visit to push ahead on negotiations over the China-GCC Free Trade Agreement (FTA). At these meetings, the principal topic of conversation was to finally seal the China-GCC FTA and a “deeper strategic cooperation in a region where U.S. dominance is showing signs of retreat”.China does not only want to control all the major oil reservoirs in the Middle East but also to get greatly beneficial pricing on everything produced from them. By dint of the 25-year Strategic Cooperation Agreement with Iran it has been able to do this on precisely the terms laid down in my original exclusive piece on the deal. China has been able to use this as the basis for deals done with Iraq, given Tehran’s strong and enduring influence over Baghdad. Specifically, the deals China wants involves 25-year contracts but – critically – ones that only officially start two years after the signing date, so allowing China to recoup more profits on average per year and less upfront investment. The per barrel payments to China for oil would be the higher of either the mean average of the 18-month spot price for crude oil produced, or the past six months’ mean average price. It would also involve at least a 10 percent discount to China for at least five years on the value of the oil it recovered. For gas recovery, the basic terms are the same, but in terms of pricing China wants whichever developer that takes the lead to receive a 30 percent discount to the lowest mean one-year average market price at the key gas pricing hubs for the gas it captured.By Simon Watkins for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:North American LNG Projects Plagued By Price VolatilityLatin America’s Bid To Challenge China’s Dominance In The Lithium MarketKurdistan’s 400,000-Bpd Oil Exports Still Shut-In As Talks With Iraq FailRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

146,37a798cd-e3f6-3f0d-9fb8-614c7d6cb8a9,LMT,2023-03-28,13 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-most-profitable-industrial-stocks-125550906.html,1679921750,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS', 'CAT', 'LMT', 'NOC', 'MMM', 'RTX', 'HON']","[In this article, we will look at the 13 most profitable industrial stocks now. If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now.Over the past two decades, industrial players have chased after value creation by focusing on product margin optimization, channel sales excellence, and programmatic M&amp;A. While these strategies proved fruitful in the pre-pandemic era, the disruptive forces of COVID-19, intensified by recent geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine, have ushered in a new world. While the industrials sector has experienced a decent rebound from a painful pandemic-driven recession, it also emerged to find a chaotic environment characterized by dramatic shifts in consumer purchasing behaviors, labor shortages, and global supply chain networks.In the past year, the industrials sector was largely driven by the same concerns as the broader market. High inflation—and the implications of high inflation for interest-rate policy—weighed heavily on stocks. The sector largely tracked the broad market's performance for much of the year, though after a bounce in the fourth quarter was on track to outperform the S&amp;P 500 for the year. The industrials sector may continue to be impacted in 2023 by many of the same near-term worries as other sectors—including, most pressingly, the increased risk of US or global recession. However, for investors with a long-term view, three key trends in the sector have created opportunities for US-based industrial companies: digital technologies and processes, an increased focus on sustainability, and a revival of domestic production instead of globe-spanning supply chains.Additionally, a recent survey by McKinsey states that executives at several industrial companies have identified three crucial priorities that have emerged during these past few years: rising costs and inflationary pressures, talent retention and skill gaps among workers, and supply chain disruptions. While many companies are still focused on post-pandemic top-line recovery alongside combating short-term disruptions to maintain operating margins, leading firms are doubling down on long-term structural changes to how they approach customer interactions, supply chain resilience, and talent retention. While a US or global recession, should one occur, could slow the progress of these changes, it would be unlikely to derail them completely.Story continuesIndustrial stocks include some of the oldest public companies that seem to form the backbone of the U.S. economy while lending their name to one of the key U.S. stock market indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months.

In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 940 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now13. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), commonly known as simply UPS, is an American multinational shipping &amp; receiving and supply chain management company founded in 1907. Originally known as the American Messenger Company specializing in telegraphs, UPS has grown to become a Fortune 500 company and one of the world's largest shipping couriers.At the beginning of February, MO Capital analyst Fadi Chamoun raised the price target on United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) to $185 from $175 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares after its Q4 earnings beat. The analyst seems ""encouraged"" by the company's steady execution and productivity improvements that laid the foundation for a strong performance once demand recovers. However, he warns against headwinds into the first half of 2023.On January 31, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) raised its quarterly dividend to $1.62 per share, thus growing  its dividend growth streak to 13 years.As of the close of Q4 2022, 36 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned investments in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), worth over $514.6 million. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is a notable shareholder in the company, with a stake worth approximately $128.76 million.Much like TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) has been raking in profits for its investors.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned UPS in Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”12. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is an American publicly traded, multinational conglomerate corporation that primarily operates in four areas of business: aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. For fiscal Q4 2022, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) reported earnings-per-share of $2.52, beating estimates by $0.01. The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $9.11 billion.On February 3, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa raised the price target on Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) to $215 from $205 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. According to Tusa, the company's Q4 results and 2023 guidance were largely in line with expectations, and he sees an upside to the future outlook.Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was spotted on 44 investors’ portfolios at the end of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $679.62 million. As of December 31, Diamond Hill Capital is the leading investor in the company and has disclosed a position worth $245.4 million.11. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), formerly Federal Express Corporation and later FDX Corporation, is an American multinational conglomerate holding company focused on transportation, e-commerce and business services. On February 17, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share, in-line with its previous dividend. The company maintains a 21-year streak of consistent dividend growth.BofA analyst Ken Hoexter upgraded FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $233, up from $204. The analyst seems more confident in FedEx's outlook as it reduces excess capacity and enhances productivity. Additionally, he thinks that the headcount reductions could be a roughly $0.4 tailwind to quarterly EPS, while also stating that the company's aspirational targets are moving closer to reality.At the end of December 2022, 48 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), down from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.48 billion. Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen were some of the company’s leading stakeholders in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Earnings results at FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, disappointed due to slowing volumes—principally in its Express segment, which resulted in negative operating leverage—in addition to continued cost pressures. The Express business has been affected by trade disruptions in Asia from China’s COVID lockdowns, as well as the mix of global consumer spending trending back toward services and away from goods—a normalization of pandemic-driven consumer behavior. A key question for investors is how much of this demand slowdown is idiosyncratic and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is the start of a possible cyclical slowdown. To counter these headwinds, FedEx is looking to achieve cost reductions while it continues to implement multi-year structural cost reduction initiatives focused on technology investments and efficiency gains. Given a mixed track record and the recent earnings miss, there is a high degree of skepticism embedded in the current stock price as it sells for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings. While operating results can be choppy, the longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”10. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is an American multinational aerospace and defense technology company. With 90,000 employees and an annual revenue in excess of $30 billion, it is one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers and military technology providers. The company stated that it is expecting solid margins and free cash-flow growth in 2023. Additionally, it expects to return at least 100% of adjusted free cash-flow to shareholders this year.At the end of January, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers raised his price target on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to $470 from $460 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Although the company's initial guide reset expectations with margins below on macro factors and CAS headwinds, the analyst points out that Northrop Grumman appears committed to an aggressive share repurchase, potentially limiting downside for the stock.There were 49 hedge funds long Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in the fourth quarter of 2022, and their total stake value in the company was $1.53 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the largest stakeholder in the company in the fourth quarter, holding stakes worth $428.26 million in the company.LRT Capital Management, an investment management firm, mentioned Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is an American manufacturing company that specializes in the production of construction equipment that also operates as the world's leading manufacturer of mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.On February 7, BMO Capital analyst Joel Tiss raised the price target on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) to $230 from $210 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares of the manufacturing company. The analyst cites Caterpillar's ""strong"" underlying results in Q4 and believes that low inventory levels at its dealers, greater operating efficiencies, and share repurchases should help support earnings over the next few years.Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.99%, as of February 22. The company holds a 28-year streak of consistent dividend growth.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) grew to 50 in Q4 2022, from 43 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $5 billion. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the company's leading shareholder for the quarter.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In the case of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the company reported a better-than-expected Q3 as demand in mining, non-residential construction and energy remained healthy through the year even as recession fears grew. Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”8. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. Not only does it rank as one of the largest aerospace and defense manufacturers in the world by revenue and market capitalization, the company is also one of the largest providers of intelligence services, as well as a large military contractor, getting a significant portion of its revenue from the U.S. government.Earlier this January, RBC Capital analyst Ken Herbert raised the price target on Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to $110 from $107 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares after its Q4 earnings beat. The analyst was ""not surprised"" by the relief rally in the stock following these results and remains positive on the defense conglomerate on account of its aerospace business growth and the expected acceleration in its defense sales.Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) remained a popular buy among hedge funds in Q4 2022, as 51 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, valued at approximately $1.82 billion. Dmitry Balyasny's Balyasny Asset Management was the company's biggest shareholder, with 2.27 million stakes worth $229.9 million.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) announced strong results led by strength in its commercial segment, but weakness in its defense business led to investor consternation. Management guided to a recovery in this segment, citing both transitory supply chain issues and continued strong demand.”7. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 523M Company (NYSE:MMM), formerly known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company,  is a multinational conglomerate corporation with operations in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, transportation, consumer products, and industrial markets. On February 7, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) declared a quarterly dividend rate of $1.50, a $0.01 increase from the previous rate.Earlier this December, Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz raised the price target on 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) to $126 from $117 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analyst, megatrends and ""still emerging fiscal tailwinds"" should help moderate potential downside for industrials in a slowing macro-economic environment in addition to improving price versus cost trends and gradually improving supply chains.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) was part of 52 public stock portfolios at the end of December 2022, compared to 49 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.46 million shares worth $295.95 million.Mayar Capital mentioned 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53The Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta in March 1995, is an American aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with worldwide interests. This past year, Lockheed Martin's Rotary &amp; Mission Systems segment amounted to about $16.15 billion while the company's product segment with the highest net sales of nearly $27 billion was Aeronautics.On February 6, Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to Outperform from Underperform with a price target of $510, up from $427, based on the firm's updated sector outlook, improved confidence in the company's growth inflection and alignment in the firm's out-year EBIT growth forecasts between Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).

The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. A counter cyclical stock is a term used to describe the shares of a company that operates in an industry or sector that typically experiences financial performance that is inversely correlated to the overall state of the economy. This means that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the general economic trend. During times of economic downturn or recession, the stock price of a counter cyclical company tends to increase, while during times of economic expansion, it tends to decrease in value. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern for the global economy. Although there have been some recent positive developments, the recovery is expected to be moderate over the next two years. The outlook is fragile, and there are many risks that could lead to a decline in economic activity. The uncertainty created by the war could have a severe impact on trade. Additionally, there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities, particularly in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. Although there has been a decline in headline inflation, it remains high and could persist for a more extended period. The global economy experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with a rate of 3.2%, which was more than 1 percentage point lower than the expected rate at the end of 2021. The main reasons for this were the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting cost-of-living crisis in several countries. OECD predicts that growth will continue to be lower than expected in 2023 and 2024.Against the current economic backdrop, investors who used to have portfolios focused on growth are actively seeking stocks that typically perform well during times of economic downturns and slower growth. These types of stocks, such as PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), are known as counter cyclical stocks and tend to perform better during recessions.Story continuesOur Methodology The companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for this list, including discount retailers, tobacco firms, agriculture and food businesses, as well as healthcare and insurance firms. We chose the top counter cyclical stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Don't Miss: 14 Best Stocks to Buy Before the 2023 Recession Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashBest Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now11. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the biggest tobacco and cigarette companies in the world. Demand for tobacco increases when consumers are facing higher stress, unemployment, and financial constraints during economic slowdowns. On March 9, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.27 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 11, to shareholders of record on March 23. On March 1, UBS upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $116, up from $106. The firm predicts a growth acceleration in the shipment of heated tobacco products in mature markets due to Iluma, and appreciates the company's ""strong cash flow"" in the combustible business. Despite Iluma's current margin dilution, UBS suggests that new product launches will generate immediate volume and share growth, with scale benefits to be realized in the second half of 2023. The launch of Bonds for low-end markets and U.S. IQOS in 2024 is expected to further enhance Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s status as the ""best-in-class"" in the tobacco industry.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was part of 47 hedge fund portfolios, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 24.25 million shares worth $2.45 billion. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”10. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), an American agribusiness and food company, is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to watch. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19. Effective from March 15, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) replaced Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) in the S&amp;P 500.On February 9, Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $115, down from $127. The company topped consensus estimates but issued initial 2023 guidance below Street expectations, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. On February 16, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend, a 4.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.44. The dividend is payable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. In 2023, the company announced its 61st consecutive annual dividend increase, making it a reliable dividend king. On March 20, Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but reduced its price target on the shares from $63 to $60. The firm believes that there is a growing possibility of economic challenges ahead for the consumer staples industry. As a result, Deutsche Bank is becoming more worried about the potential risks to the company's future financial performance across much of its coverage.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 400 million shares worth $25.4 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the biggest American discount retailers. On March 16, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.96, beating market estimates by $0.02. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) also reiterated its plans to execute 3,170 real estate projects in fiscal 2023, including 1,050 new store openings, 2,000 remodels, and 120 store relocations. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to monitor. On March 17, Deutsche Bank increased its estimated price on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) shares from $248 to $249 and maintained a Buy rating following the release of the company's Q4 results. According to the firm, it seems that the market underestimated the expected performance of the company in 2023, which is now anticipated to be more heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. Additionally, Deutsche Bank suggests that the decrease in planned share buybacks may be due in part to higher levels of capital expenditures.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), and Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 788,664 shares worth $194.20 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) contributed to performance in the second quarter following the report of first quarter earnings that were above expectations. Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale worldwide. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The dividend is distributable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to watch. According to Morgan Stanley's recent survey, Walmart+ has 18.4 million members, which is equivalent to 14.3% of U.S. households. This figure is slightly higher than the previous survey and almost the same as the record high of 18.6 million members in September 2022. The firm believes that there is still room for more growth in Walmart+ based on the actual number of members and the number of respondents who are very likely to join. Morgan Stanley recommends buying Walmart shares and reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $160 on March 7. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 66 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7 million shares worth $993.2 million.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”6.

The company is experiencing difficulties with its comp sales growth slowing down due to inflation and possible competitive pressures affecting its gross margins. Roth MKM informed investors in a research note that even though Costco is gaining market share and may increase its membership fees, the stock's value is still too high, considering the limited potential earnings upside in FY23.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 937,521 shares worth about $428 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to invest in. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:20 Most Advanced Countries in the World in 202325 Best Stocks for Dividends11 Best Space Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share, indicating a change of -6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $10.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.5%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.94 indicates a change of +4.1% from what Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson &amp; Johnson.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for JNJ _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $23.59 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $97.73 billion and $100.68 billion estimates indicate +2.9% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryJohnson &amp; Johnson reported revenues of $23.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4.4%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $2.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.22%. The EPS surprise was +5.86%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Johnson &amp; Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson &amp; Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Results from the trial showed the KEYTRUDA regimen demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients, regardless of mismatch repair status. These late-breaking data are being presented for the first time during a scientific plenary at the 2023 Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer (abstract #338166) and are also being simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results are being discussed with regulatory authorities worldwide.In the pMMR cohort of 591 evaluable patients, after a median follow-up of 7.9 months, the KEYTRUDA regimen significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 46% (HR=0.54 [95% CI, 0.41-0.71]; p&lt;0.00001) compared to chemotherapy alone; median PFS was 13.1 months (95% CI, 10.5-18.8) for the KEYTRUDA regimen versus 8.7 months (95% CI, 8.4-10.7) for chemotherapy alone. In the dMMR cohort of 225 evaluable patients, after a median follow-up of 12 months, the KEYTRUDA regimen significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 70% (HR=0.30 [95% CI, 0.19-0.48]; p&lt;0.00001) compared to chemotherapy alone; median PFS was not reached (95% CI, 30.6-NR) for the KEYTRUDA regimen versus 7.6 months (95% CI, 6.4-9.9) for chemotherapy alone.Story continues""Endometrial cancer is the most common type of gynecological cancer, and patients with advanced stage or recurrent disease face a poor prognosis with limited treatment options,"" said Dr. Ramez Eskander, principal investigator and gynecologic oncologist, University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center. ""The significant improvement in progression-free survival regardless of mismatch repair status observed in this study demonstrates the potential of this pembrolizumab regimen to benefit these patients.""The safety profile of KEYTRUDA in this trial was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies; no new safety signals were identified. Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 55.1% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen and 45.3% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone in the pMMR cohort. In the dMMR cohort, Grade 3-5 AEs occurred in 63.3% of patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen and 47.2% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. There were no KEYTRUDA-related AEs leading to death in either cohort.""KEYTRUDA has become an important treatment option, both as monotherapy and in combination, in certain patients with advanced endometrial cancer who have progressed following prior systemic therapy and are not candidates for surgery or radiation,"" said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. ""Results from this trial show that KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, if approved, may represent an important new first-line immunotherapy option for patients with stage III-IV disease, and could extend the use of KEYTRUDA to more patients earlier in their treatment journey.""This trial was sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. NRG Oncology designed and led the trial with funding from the NCI and participation from all the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) Groups. Merck provided funding and support through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Merck and NCI.In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in endometrial cancer: in combination with LENVIMA® (lenvatinib), in collaboration with Eisai, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is pMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation; and as a single agent, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.Merck has a comprehensive clinical development program in breast and gynecological (ovarian, cervical, and endometrial) cancers, comprised of more than 20 Merck-sponsored Phase 3 studies evaluating KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination with other medicines. In endometrial cancer, Merck is evaluating KEYTRUDA in first-line advanced endometrial cancer both as monotherapy (KEYNOTE-C93/ENGOT-en15/GOG-3064) and in combination with LENVIMA (LEAP-001/ENGOT-en9), as well as in the adjuvant setting (KEYNOTE-B21/ENGOT-en11/GOG-3053).About NRG-GY018NRG-GY018 is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03914612) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) versus placebo plus standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of measurable stage III, IVA, IVB or recurrent endometrial cancer in pMMR and dMMR cohorts. The primary endpoint is PFS, and secondary endpoints include overall survival, objective response rate, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 816 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy every three weeks for approximately six cycles followed by KEYTRUDA as a single agent every six weeks for up to 14 cycles, or placebo plus chemotherapy. Enrolled patients were required to have MMR IHC testing prior to randomization; 591 patients were determined to have pMMR tumors, and 225 were determined to have dMMR tumors.About endometrial carcinomaEndometrial carcinoma begins in the inner lining of the uterus, which is known as the endometrium, and is the most common type of cancer in the uterus. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 66,000 new cases of uterine body cancer and approximately 13,000 deaths from the disease in 2023. Globally, endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women and 15th most common cancer overall.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Endometrial CarcinomaKEYTRUDA, in combination with LENVIMA, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is MSI-H or dMMR, as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.HypophysitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Thyroid DisordersKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients.Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic KetoacidosisMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in &lt;0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in &lt;0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.Immune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal DysfunctionKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis.

All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.Other Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of &lt;1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, the combination of lenvatinib with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity compared to either treatment alone.LENVIMA® (lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S.For the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)In combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC)In combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapyFor the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)In combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), as determined by an FDA-approved test, or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.Selected Safety Information for LENVIMAWarnings and PrecautionsHypertension. In DTC (differentiated thyroid cancer), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4). In RCC (renal cell carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 42% of patients on LENVIMA + everolimus (13% grade 3). Systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg occurred in 29% of patients, and 21% had diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg. In HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), hypertension occurred in 45% of LENVIMA-treated patients (24% grade 3). Grade 4 hypertension was not reported in HCC.Serious complications of poorly controlled hypertension have been reported. Control blood pressure prior to initiation. Monitor blood pressure after 1 week, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and then at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose when hypertension is controlled or permanently discontinue based on severity.Cardiac Dysfunction. Serious and fatal cardiac dysfunction can occur with LENVIMA. Across clinical trials in 799 patients with DTC, RCC, and HCC, grade 3 or higher cardiac dysfunction occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor for clinical symptoms or signs of cardiac dysfunction. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Arterial Thromboembolic Events. Among patients receiving LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus, arterial thromboembolic events of any severity occurred in 2% of patients in RCC and HCC and 5% in DTC. Grade 3-5 arterial thromboembolic events ranged from 2% to 3% across all clinical trials.Among patients receiving LENVIMA with pembrolizumab, arterial thrombotic events of any severity occurred in 5% of patients in CLEAR, including myocardial infarction (3.4%) and cerebrovascular accident (2.3%).Permanently discontinue following an arterial thrombotic event. The safety of resuming after an arterial thromboembolic event has not been established, and LENVIMA has not been studied in patients who have had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months.Hepatotoxicity. Across clinical studies enrolling 1327 LENVIMA-treated patients with malignancies other than HCC, serious hepatic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% of patients. Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients.

In RCC, renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 18% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (10% grade 3).Initiate prompt management of diarrhea or dehydration/hypovolemia. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue for renal failure or impairment based on severity.Proteinuria. In DTC and HCC, proteinuria was reported in 34% and 26% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 proteinuria occurred in 11% and 6% in DTC and HCC, respectively. In RCC, proteinuria occurred in 31% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus (8% grade 3). Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria ≥2+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Diarrhea. Of the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Fistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation. Of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%.

In DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of &gt;500 ms occurred in 2%. In RCC, QTc interval increases of &gt;60 ms occurred in 11% of patients receiving LENVIMA + everolimus and QTc interval &gt;500 ms occurred in 6%. In HCC, QTc interval increases of &gt;60 ms occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QTc interval &gt;500 ms occurred in 2%.Monitor and correct electrolyte abnormalities at baseline and periodically during treatment. Monitor electrocardiograms in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery based on severity.Hypocalcemia. In DTC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In 65% of cases, hypocalcemia improved or resolved following calcium supplementation with or without dose interruption or dose reduction. In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS). Across clinical studies of 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.Hemorrhagic Events. Serious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.Consider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction. LENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level ≤0.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level &gt;0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus–treated patients in RCC.Monitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.Impaired Wound Healing. Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ). ONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease, or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.Avoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.Withhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.Embryo‐Fetal Toxicity. Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for at least 30 days after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (≥30%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

(MRK): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-merck-co-130001849.html,1679922001,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 1.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, indicating a change of -33.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.2%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.59 indicates a change of +25% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Merck is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.8 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -13.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $58.51 billion and $62.47 billion estimates indicate -1.3% and +6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

166,200e0362-9b32-35d2-b9a1-3f8a68ac4454,BA,2023-03-28,15 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-biggest-airplanes-world-2023-143307214.html,1679927587,STORY,"['BA', 'EADSY']","[In this article, we will discuss the 15 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023. You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023.On December 17th, 1903, the age of modern aviation was born when brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful flight in the history of mankind. Since then, we have witnessed some incredible milestones, including the development of the jet engine, and the breaking of the sound barrier in the SR-71 Blackbird, to name just a few. From the massive Zeppelin bombers of World War I to the wooden planes of the 1940s all the way through to today’s wonders of science and engineering, airplanes have gone from small and agile machines powered by propellors to heavy behemoths launched thousands of feet into the air by turbofan jet engines. The world's first-ever jumbo jet, the Boeing 747, was constructed by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in 1970. Over 50 years later, the airline industry is considered saturated by wide-body aircraft, with the likes of the Airbus A380, the Antonov AN-225, and the Hughes H-4, alongside others, vying for the title of the 'biggest'.While these giants of aviation, symbols of humanity's progress across the ages, never cease to amaze, they had almost entirely been replaced by their smaller competitors until very recently. Even before the pandemic temporarily shut down most air travel, airlines had been shying away from the biggest wide-body planes in favor of smaller twin-aisles, or longer-range narrow-body jets, believing that they offered more flight flexibility alongside better fuel economy. At the height of the pandemic, the shift toward smaller planes intensified, resulting in several airlines either deferring or outright canceling orders for twin-aisle planes and moving to permanently park the biggest jets, including dozens of Boeing 747s and Airbus A380s.Admittedly, large planes are still short of making a comeback, as evidenced by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) rolling out its last 747 jumbo jet on December 6, 2022, more than half a century after production of the plane began. Although many such planes are still in use, this last delivery reflects a growing industry shift from bulky four-engine planes to more cost-efficient twin-engine models. Additionally, as illustrated by a report by the Wall Street Journal, the total number of flights operated on twin-aisle jets in January of this year came in at only 76% of the total flown in the same month in 2020. By all accounts, the aerospace industry seems pressurized due to these developments.Story continuesHowever, a report by the Business Research Company states that the global aerospace market grew from $261.12 billion in 2022 to $278.43 billion in 2023, with the market expected to further reach $358.44 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 6.5%. The industry seems to be betting on pent-up travel demand from China after it dropped most of its travel restrictions as part of its zero-COVID policy. The return to the skies of bigger aircraft appears to be driving new sales and campaigns for both The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and Airbus after years of slumping demand. This past year, the two airline company's reported 301 gross orders for their wide-body jets. Additionally, Boeing and Airbus sales staff are chasing after several big orders for new planes from carriers and lessors in order to compensate for the increased demand for wide-body planes.Meanwhile, the scramble for big planes has overturned conventional wisdom in the aviation industry as several airlines are clamoring for their once-parked fleets of giants, which typically each accommodate hundreds of passengers on long-distance routes. According to John Plueger, chief executive officer of Air Lease Corporation (NYSE:AL):“There has been a tremendous acceleration in the last eight to 12 months in the wide-body marketplace.”  Of course, among all the unrest and uncertainty, as can be said for all feats of technical innovation, the quest to build the biggest, longest, or heaviest goes on.Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023Photo by NOAA on UnsplashOur MethodologyWith regards to aircraft, 'big' is a subjective matter, as there are many ways to measure large aircraft - including length, weight, volume, or wingspan. While we'll take all of these factors into consideration, it should to noted that some of the airplanes mentioned in this list all have different metrics that can technically make them the largest aircraft in the world depending on which metric you choose to focus on. To provide our readers with more clarity and to come up with an accurate list of the biggest planes in the world, we sifted through the data and information provided by reputable sources, including CNN, Discovery UK, USA Today, and Plane and Pilot Mag, among others. Our rankings reflect the consensus opinion and rankings of these reliable sources.Biggest Airplanes in the World in 202315. Aero Spaceline’s Super GuppyThe Aero Spacelines Super Guppy is a large, wide-bodied cargo aircraft that is used for hauling outsize cargo components. A successor to the Pregnant Guppy, the first, the Super Guppy, or ""SG"", was built directly from the fuselage of a C-97J Turbo Stratocruiser, the military version of the 1950s Boeing 377 Stratocruiser passenger plane. The bloated aircraft has been retired by every institution in the world except for one: NASA.According to the U.S. space agency, the Guppy’s wide dimensions are perfect for transporting spacecraft and rocket components. Boasting an immense cargo area that is 25 feet in diameter and 111 feet long, the Super Guppy can carry items that are virtually impossible to fit inside other cargo aircraft. In early August of last year, it arrived at Marshall with a structural test article of part of NASA's mega Moon rocket. Despite being largely replaced by the Airbus Beluga for large and awkwardly shaped cargo delivery, the Super Guppy will continue to baffle people in the sky for as long as NASA has a need for it.14. Lockheed Martin C-5M Super GalaxyWith a payload capacity of almost 135 tons, the C-5M Super Galaxy is the largest aircraft in the US Air Force inventory. An upgraded version of the C-5 Galaxy, the C-5M features new engines and modernized avionics designed to extend its service life to 2040 and beyond. Capable of airlifting two M1 Abrams battle tanks, 16 Humvees, three Black Hawks, or a variety of other vehicles, the monstrous airlifter has a vast, cavernous interior.The C-5M, with a cargo load of 281,001 pounds, can fly 2,150 nautical miles, offload at a base, and fly another 500 nautical miles away from the original destination — all without aerial refueling. With aerial refueling, however, the aircraft's range is limited only by crew endurance.13. McDonnell Douglas KC-10 ExtenderWhile the U.S. military has a number of aircraft types to fulfill distinct roles, there is one type of asset that comes in handy during all operations: the aerial refueler. The McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender is one such aircraft in service with the USAF for more than four decades now. The largest fuel capacity tanker aircraft in the world with a 164-foot wingspan, the aircraft can haul 52,520 gallons of fuel onboard.Originally developed from the Advanced Tanker Cargo Aircraft Program, it incorporates military-specific equipment for its primary roles of transport and aerial refueling. Serving both the USAF and the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the KC-10 stores jet fuel in three main wing tanks, as well as large fuel tanks under the cargo floor. It can alternately be flown with a crew of 75 and 73 tons of cargo, or 85 tons of cargo in an all-cargo configuration.12. Boeing C-17 Globemaster IIIThe C-5 Galaxy may be the U.S.’s biggest military plane, but the C-17 Globemaster III is the primary workhorse. In operational use since the 1990s, the massive, sturdy, long-haul aircraft tackles distance, destination and heavy, oversized payloads in unpredictable conditions. Originally meant to be a C-17A, the massive airlifter became the Globemaster III on February 5, 1993, following on from the USAF’s Douglas C-74 Globemaster and C-124 Globemaster II post-war piston-engined transports.With a payload of 164,900 pounds, the C-17 is able to carry heavy military machinery, including the M1 Abrams main battle tank, infantry fighting vehicles, artillery pieces, and even up to 3 AH-64 Apache helicopters. Additionally, the airlifter is capable of taking-off from a 7000-foot airfield, and flying over 2400 nautical miles. Additionally, he aircraft’s design enables high-angle, steep approaches at relatively slow speeds, allowing it to operate into small, austere airfields and onto runways as short as 3,500ft long and just 90ft wide.11. Ilyushin Il-76The Ilyushin Il-76 is a multi-purpose, fixed-wing, four-engine turbofan strategic airlifter designed by the Soviet Union's Ilyushin design bureau. It was first planned as a commercial freighter in 1967 meant to act as a replacement for the Antonov An-12. The aircraft came to life in 1971 and was designed to withstand extreme conditions, with a short take off and landing capability on both paved and unpaved runways.With over 800 produced, the Il-76 served as the backbone of the Soviet Airlift Command during the Cold War era, boasting a 164-foot wingspan, the ability to transport up to 140 troops, and a max payload of up to 50 tons. The aircraft continues its service even today in several countries.10. Boeing B-52 StratofortressThe B-52 bomber is the grandfather of the air force: aging, but still capable of delivering a serious punch. The eight-engine, 390,000-pound (176,901-kilogram) jet was the United States’ first long-range, swept-wing heavy bomber. It began as an intercontinental, high-altitude nuclear bomber, and its operational capabilities were adapted to meet changing defense needs.One of the largest aircrafts in the world with a 185-foot wingspan, the Stratofortress is a veritable giant. Due to its high mission-capable rate, large payload, long range, persistence and ability to employ both nuclear and conventional precision standoff weapons, the B-52 continues to be a critical contributor to the U.S. National Security Strategy.9. Boeing 747 DreamlifterWhile Boeing began planning for its 787 Dreamliner in the early 2000s, the project was hindered as conventional shipping methods for the aircraft's components would take too long. To combat this problem, Boeing opted to convert four existing passenger configured 747-400s. The outsized aircraft, known as the Dreamlifter, adorned a bulging fuselage, similar to the bulbous Super Guppy, or the Airbus Beluga. While it was designed to transport Boeing 787 Dreamliner parts between Italy, Japan, and the U.S., the aircraft has also flown medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic.At 65,000 cubic feet, the Dreamlifter has the largest cargo hold in the world, capable of carrying three times the volume of a 747-400F freighter. The four Dreamlifters Boeing made also use the longest cargo loader in the world, and can haul payloads up to 125 tons.8. Airbus Beluga XLDeveloped in 2014, the Beluga XL flew its first operational flight in 2020 after more than 200 test flights. Meant to resemble a flying whale the Beluga XL is Airbus’s flying monster capable of hauling some of the biggest things all over the world, including of the wings of the A380, the biggest passenger plane in the world.The plane boasts the largest cross section of any cargo plane in the world and with a maximum payload of 51 tons and is designed to fly over four million miles a year at a cruising speed of Mach 0.69, or 530 mph.7. Antonov An-124 RuslanThe Antonov An-124 Ruslan, also known as Condor according to official NATO designation, is a large, strategic airlift, four-engine aircraft that was designed in the 1980s by the Antonov design bureau in the Ukrainian SSR, then part of the Soviet Union. For almost 30 years after its introduction in 1984, the An-124 reigned as the largest and heaviest cargo aircraft in the world, besides the single An-225. However, it was later dethroned by the 747-8F in 2011.With a reported payload capacity of 165 tons, the An-124 can haul even more cargo than the C-5 Galaxy, though its range isn’t as long. The newest version (developed by Aviastar), the AN-124-100M-150, increased the aircraft’s take-off weight from 392,000 kg to 402,000 kg and the flight range with 120,000 kg of cargo increased from 4,650km to 5,400km. A surviving engineering triumph of the Soviets, the An-124 continues to fly airlifting missions for Russia.6. Boeing 747-8The iconic 747, known as ‘Queen of the Skies,’ revolutionized air travel as the world’s first twin-aisle airplane and enabled more people to fly farther, faster and more affordably than ever before. Distinguished by recognizable hump, this historic airplane is a symbol of great engineering, innovation and often noted as an outstanding work of architecture. The 747-8 variant has four GEnx-2B67 engines mounted under the wings, each providing 66,500lb of thrust. Additionally, the design of the 747-8 aircraft engine is slightly modified variant of the GEnx engine developed for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft.Known as the largest passenger aircraft in the US and the second-largest passenger aircraft in the world, it’s no surprise that it was nicknamed the “flying fortress” by the former president of the United States, Donald Trump. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023. Suggested Articles:Early Retirement Portfolio: 15 Stocks to Live Off Dividends Revisited12 Safe Stocks to Buy For Long Term15 Best Countries to Live in the FutureDisclosure: none. 15 Biggest Airplanes in the World in 2023 is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Connected Insights is commercially available in a limited number of countries, and is undergoing beta testing in the US.Expanding on Illumina's Connected Software portfolio, Connected Insights is designed to streamline interpretation and reporting from a range of assay types, enabling labs to scale use of NGS and reduce turnaround time of clinical reporting via integration of third-party knowledge bases. The initial release will support somatic oncology applications, coinciding with the increasing use of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for advanced tumors. Ultimately it is designed to support a diverse range of applications, soon including whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for rare disease. Connected Insights is commercially available in a limited number of countries. The product is undergoing beta testing in the US.""We're seeing growing demand for NGS testing in health care systems, and with that comes the need for interpretation of large genomic data sets with complex health implications in a landscape of frequently changing guidelines and drug approvals,"" said Rami Mehio, head of global software and informatics at Illumina. ""Connected Insights complements our suite of NGS solutions to generate, analyze, annotate, and interpret data consistently—today and into the future.""Growing use of NGS leads to greater need for data solutionsAlbrecht Stenzinger, whose lab was an early-access customer of Connected Insights, says there has been a growing push in recent years for more CGP for cancer therapy response prediction at the time of diagnosis, and for the use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) and WGS for rare and pediatric cancers. Along with that, advances in earlier cancer detection and target drug approvals for early-stage disease will fuel the need for further comprehensive testing.Story continues""If you are generating this massive amount of data, you need to interpret this in a meaningful way,"" Stenzinger, director of the Center for Molecular Pathology at the University of Heidelberg, said. ""It's very hard nowadays to reliably interpret these thousands or even millions of different variants—even in intergenic regions—in a way that is clinically, directly applicable.""Mehio noted that Illumina and its peers across the industry are working to reduce the barriers to access and adoption of NGS testing—including cost, workflow, and reimbursement. He added, ""As those barriers diminish, and clinical adoption of NGS matures, the need to bridge great volumes of data with manageable and clinically meaningful reporting becomes more critical for our customers.""Connected Insights enables labs to connect to a network of more than 45 third-party knowledge sources, including The Clinical Knowledgebase by The Jackson Laboratory. These sources provide digital directories for precision oncology, illustrating connections between cancer variants and therapies, citing evidence, and aiding analysis of complex cancer genomic profiles. Connected Insights can also link users to regional guidelines, clinical trial databases, drug labels, and a private, bespoke collection of data from previous cases within the customer's lab—all of which informs the generation of clinical reports for providers. A connected software ecosystemAn existing challenge for labs generating genomic data is that analysis pipelines vary across NGS test types, making both standardization and data comparison more difficult. Connected Insights is designed to allow users to manage their data, which can enable standardized interpretation and reporting across NGS test types.Eric Duncavage, professor of pathology and immunology and head of molecular oncology at Washington University, and an early-access customer of Connected Insights, said: ""I used to always tell our trainees, 'There's not a Microsoft Office for genome analysis. You have to run all these different tools, and it's complicated.' I think what Illumina has done [with DRAGEN and its other software] is make genome analysis a step closer to an Office-like suite where it'll do everything.""""Connected Insights is the next step in creating a fully-integrated software ecosystem that scales with the pace of discovery, across NGS applications,"" said Jing Gao, vice president of software engineering at Illumina. ""Building on our platforms of proven SBS technology with DRAGEN secondary analysis, Illumina Connected Analytics—and now Connected Insights—enables our users to bring a variety of knowledgebases and data together to discover clinical relevance.

The company has been facing financial issues and is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors in New York City.

Total capital return is ~4% today (in good part because of its valuation), below the level it was when he purchased the majority of his stake,” said Bernstein.The firm concluded that although Apple is a great company, its valuation seems less appealing both in absolute terms and in comparison to other larger-cap technology companies.Carl Icahn issues a new statement to Illumina shareholdersCarl Icahn wrote a letter to Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) shareholders, urging an investigation “into the massive value destruction caused by the reckless decision” to acquire GRAIL despite objections from European antitrust regulators. Icahn emphasized that the directors required additional personal liability protection a day prior to closing the deal “and buried the news in the hopes that no one would notice”.In response to this, Illumina issued a statement, noting that Directors and Officers (D&amp;O) insurance and corporate indemnification are standard for Delaware companies, and support directors in making decisions in the best interests of shareholders. The company cited The Financial Times that ""it is not uncommon for a company buying another business to increase insurance limits during the acquisition process.""“Mr. Icahn's nominees lack relevant skills and experience for Illumina's Board. Mr. Icahn has no ability to accelerate the legal and regulatory processes and neither do his nominees,” added the company.Related ArticlesHedge funds and C-suites: Trump-linked DWAC fires CEO | Pro RecapRental car firm Hertz's finance chief Cheung to quitU.S. backstops Silicon Valley Bank's sale to First Citizens]"

171,f6c0455f-9b11-336c-a6ec-edaf2b7772d2,SO,2023-03-28,20 Biggest Power Generation Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-power-generation-companies-145823295.html,1679929103,STORY,"['NEE-PR', 'SO', 'GE', 'KEP']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest power generation companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest power generation companies in the world.Consistent generation and supply of power is absolutely integral to the development of any economy, and is one of the primary factors behind industrialization and the growth of Western economies. While just the 20 biggest power generation companies in the world earn annual revenues exceeding $2 trillion, their indirect contribution is even more significant as power supply is the backbone for the vast majority of industries across all sectors, across the world.Despite its importance, 2022 was not a very good year for the power and utility sector generally, but in the U.S., sales still continued to increase as demand jumped with the country mostly recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, even though revenues increased significantly because of the aforementioned demand, costs increased even more as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to energy supplies being depleted and prices more than doubling. Meanwhile, grid resilience is continuing to be tested from catastrophic climate events, one of the biggest global risks for 2023. To combat this issue, the biggest players in the industry, including some of the biggest power generation companies in the world, improved their reserves, deployed microgrids and worked on improving their infrastructure as well.25 biggest power generation companies in the worldPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashWhile these developments are likely to increase further in 2023 and even beyond, it is important to remember that as the Russian Ukraine war continues with no idea of when hostilities will cease, electricity prices are likely to stay high in 2023 while inflation and supply chain issues will add to the challenges that the industry is facing right now. Other issues such as extreme weather events and even cybersecurity will require innovation to ensure that power generation and its supply remains stable.Story continuesAs is true for most industries, the investment viability of the biggest power generation companies in the world doesn't just depend on revenue and profits but Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), which is continuing to gain momentum, especially with regards to decarbonization practices as companies try to identify societal and environmental disrupters while focus on resolving them. While such disclosures in the U.S. aren't uniform across power generation companies, this will also change in 2023, after a new SEC proposal in March 2022 regarding certain public disclosures.Another important consideration for the power generation industry is the requirement of a shift from using non-renewable resources to renewable resources. Companies creating clean energy have a lot of incentives, grants and subsidies from the government. This is why NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), the biggest renewables energy company by market cap, is also the biggest power generation company by market cap. According its Q4 2022 earnings call, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) CEO stated ""In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders."" This just helps signify the important of renewable energy production in this industry.The biggest power generation companies in the world are dominated by state-owned companies which earn significant amounts of revenue. To determine our list, we ranked them based on trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue and the latest market, both obtained from Yahoo Finance. We assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In case of private companies, we determined their revenue from Fortune Global 500, and ranked them based on revenue alone.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Mid-America Apartment Communities in FocusHeadquartered in Germantown, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -8.69% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.4 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.91%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield is 3.9%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.8%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $5.60 is up 19.8% from last year. Mid-America Apartment Communities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 5.45%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Mid-America Apartment Communities's current payout ratio is 59%. This means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.MAA is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.70 per share, with earnings expected to increase 2.35% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MAA is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has lagged the Finance sector's loss of 8.6% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.25% in that time.Cigna will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $5.35, down 10.98% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $45.27 billion, up 2.62% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $24.77 per share and revenue of $187.7 billion, which would represent changes of +6.45% and +3.91%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cigna. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

In addition to processing pharmacy payments, the PBMs aim to control spending by deciding which drugs they will pay for depending on the rebates they negotiate with pharmaceutical companies.The lawsuit said the insurance companies restricted coverage of some insulins and other medicines due to the collusion. If they didn't get the desired rebate, the companies wouldn't pay for the drugs or would favor competitors.The companies also categorize some medicines as preferred, charging patients lower out-of-pocket costs.Some drugmakers, government officials, and critics say the firms are making medicines expensive because they can negotiate higher rebates off higher prices but keep substantial sums for themselves.""They're bringing no value to the supply chain,"" Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed.

PBMs negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, health plans and pharmacies.Yost in a statement called the companies ""modern gangsters"" and said that they had ""absolutely destroyed transparency, scheming in the shadows to control drug prices on all sides of the market.""His lawsuit also targets Prime Therapeutics, a PBM jointly owned by multiple Blue Cross health insurance companies, and Ascent Health Services, a Swiss entity that Express Scripts created and partly owns with Prime.Prime declined to comment. The other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.PBMs were originally intended to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of health plans.Yost alleges that the largest PBMs, including Express Scripts, instead use their market power to push drug companies to increase prices, some of which goes to PBMs in the form of fees. He says that the drug companies participate in this ""pay to play"" scheme in order to secure placement on the formularies of covered drugs that PBMs maintain for health plans.Ascent, created by Express Scripts in 2019, bills itself as performing the same kind of negotiating services as traditional PBMs to help health plans get lower costs. Yost alleges that it is in fact a vehicle for Express Scripts, Prime and Humana's PBM arm, an Ascent customer, to share information in order to collude on prices.The lawsuit accuses the companies of violating Ohio's antitrust law and seeks an unspecified amount of money damages.

The work related to this deal will be carried out in Tucson, AZ, and is scheduled to be completed by January 2026.Importance of the RAM Guided MissileThe RAM Guided Missile weapon system is the world's most modern ship self-defense weapon and is designed to provide exceptional protection for ships of all sizes. Its strong demand can be gauged by the fact that currently 165 ships in 11 countries are equipped with this missile.The Block 2 variant, the latest evolution in the development of the RAM missile, has a larger rocket motor, an advanced control section and an enhanced RF receiver capable of detecting the quietest of threat emitters.The improvements make the missile two and a half times more maneuverable, with one and a half times the effective intercept range. This provides the Block 2 variant with the capability to defeat highly-stressing threats, increasing the survivability of the defended ship.Backed by such remarkable features, Raytheon Technologies continues to witness a strong inflow of orders involving the missile, like the latest one. This shall boost RTX’s revenues from the Missiles and Defense business unit.Growth ProspectsThe Russia-Ukraine warfare has led many nations to increase their defense spending in recent times to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any sudden assault. In this context, missiles, forming an integral part of an efficient defense system, may witness a rise in demand going forward.Per the reports from Mordor Intelligence, the missiles and missile defense system market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.8% from 2023 to 2028. Such abounding growth projections stand to benefit Raytheon, which boasts a strong portfolio of efficient missiles.Story continuesApart from RTX, defense majors that may benefit from the expanding missile market size are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. To strengthen its position in the missile market, Northrop had acquired Orbital ATK in 2018, which used to be one of the industry leaders in providing missile components across air, sea and land-based systems.Northrop has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.5%.

178,37a798cd-e3f6-3f0d-9fb8-614c7d6cb8a9,NOC,2023-03-28,13 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-most-profitable-industrial-stocks-125550906.html,1679921750,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS', 'CAT', 'LMT', 'NOC', 'MMM', 'RTX', 'HON']","[In this article, we will look at the 13 most profitable industrial stocks now. If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now.Over the past two decades, industrial players have chased after value creation by focusing on product margin optimization, channel sales excellence, and programmatic M&amp;A. While these strategies proved fruitful in the pre-pandemic era, the disruptive forces of COVID-19, intensified by recent geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine, have ushered in a new world. While the industrials sector has experienced a decent rebound from a painful pandemic-driven recession, it also emerged to find a chaotic environment characterized by dramatic shifts in consumer purchasing behaviors, labor shortages, and global supply chain networks.In the past year, the industrials sector was largely driven by the same concerns as the broader market. High inflation—and the implications of high inflation for interest-rate policy—weighed heavily on stocks. The sector largely tracked the broad market's performance for much of the year, though after a bounce in the fourth quarter was on track to outperform the S&amp;P 500 for the year. The industrials sector may continue to be impacted in 2023 by many of the same near-term worries as other sectors—including, most pressingly, the increased risk of US or global recession. However, for investors with a long-term view, three key trends in the sector have created opportunities for US-based industrial companies: digital technologies and processes, an increased focus on sustainability, and a revival of domestic production instead of globe-spanning supply chains.Additionally, a recent survey by McKinsey states that executives at several industrial companies have identified three crucial priorities that have emerged during these past few years: rising costs and inflationary pressures, talent retention and skill gaps among workers, and supply chain disruptions. While many companies are still focused on post-pandemic top-line recovery alongside combating short-term disruptions to maintain operating margins, leading firms are doubling down on long-term structural changes to how they approach customer interactions, supply chain resilience, and talent retention. While a US or global recession, should one occur, could slow the progress of these changes, it would be unlikely to derail them completely.Story continuesIndustrial stocks include some of the oldest public companies that seem to form the backbone of the U.S. economy while lending their name to one of the key U.S. stock market indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months.

In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 940 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now13. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), commonly known as simply UPS, is an American multinational shipping &amp; receiving and supply chain management company founded in 1907. Originally known as the American Messenger Company specializing in telegraphs, UPS has grown to become a Fortune 500 company and one of the world's largest shipping couriers.At the beginning of February, MO Capital analyst Fadi Chamoun raised the price target on United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) to $185 from $175 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares after its Q4 earnings beat. The analyst seems ""encouraged"" by the company's steady execution and productivity improvements that laid the foundation for a strong performance once demand recovers. However, he warns against headwinds into the first half of 2023.On January 31, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) raised its quarterly dividend to $1.62 per share, thus growing  its dividend growth streak to 13 years.As of the close of Q4 2022, 36 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned investments in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), worth over $514.6 million. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is a notable shareholder in the company, with a stake worth approximately $128.76 million.Much like TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) has been raking in profits for its investors.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned UPS in Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”12. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is an American publicly traded, multinational conglomerate corporation that primarily operates in four areas of business: aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. For fiscal Q4 2022, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) reported earnings-per-share of $2.52, beating estimates by $0.01. The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $9.11 billion.On February 3, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa raised the price target on Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) to $215 from $205 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. According to Tusa, the company's Q4 results and 2023 guidance were largely in line with expectations, and he sees an upside to the future outlook.Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was spotted on 44 investors’ portfolios at the end of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $679.62 million. As of December 31, Diamond Hill Capital is the leading investor in the company and has disclosed a position worth $245.4 million.11. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), formerly Federal Express Corporation and later FDX Corporation, is an American multinational conglomerate holding company focused on transportation, e-commerce and business services. On February 17, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share, in-line with its previous dividend. The company maintains a 21-year streak of consistent dividend growth.BofA analyst Ken Hoexter upgraded FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $233, up from $204. The analyst seems more confident in FedEx's outlook as it reduces excess capacity and enhances productivity. Additionally, he thinks that the headcount reductions could be a roughly $0.4 tailwind to quarterly EPS, while also stating that the company's aspirational targets are moving closer to reality.At the end of December 2022, 48 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), down from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.48 billion. Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen were some of the company’s leading stakeholders in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Earnings results at FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, disappointed due to slowing volumes—principally in its Express segment, which resulted in negative operating leverage—in addition to continued cost pressures. The Express business has been affected by trade disruptions in Asia from China’s COVID lockdowns, as well as the mix of global consumer spending trending back toward services and away from goods—a normalization of pandemic-driven consumer behavior. A key question for investors is how much of this demand slowdown is idiosyncratic and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is the start of a possible cyclical slowdown. To counter these headwinds, FedEx is looking to achieve cost reductions while it continues to implement multi-year structural cost reduction initiatives focused on technology investments and efficiency gains. Given a mixed track record and the recent earnings miss, there is a high degree of skepticism embedded in the current stock price as it sells for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings. While operating results can be choppy, the longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”10. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is an American multinational aerospace and defense technology company. With 90,000 employees and an annual revenue in excess of $30 billion, it is one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers and military technology providers. The company stated that it is expecting solid margins and free cash-flow growth in 2023. Additionally, it expects to return at least 100% of adjusted free cash-flow to shareholders this year.At the end of January, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers raised his price target on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to $470 from $460 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Although the company's initial guide reset expectations with margins below on macro factors and CAS headwinds, the analyst points out that Northrop Grumman appears committed to an aggressive share repurchase, potentially limiting downside for the stock.There were 49 hedge funds long Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in the fourth quarter of 2022, and their total stake value in the company was $1.53 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the largest stakeholder in the company in the fourth quarter, holding stakes worth $428.26 million in the company.LRT Capital Management, an investment management firm, mentioned Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc.

(NYSE:CAT) to $230 from $210 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares of the manufacturing company. The analyst cites Caterpillar's ""strong"" underlying results in Q4 and believes that low inventory levels at its dealers, greater operating efficiencies, and share repurchases should help support earnings over the next few years.Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.99%, as of February 22. The company holds a 28-year streak of consistent dividend growth.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Caterpillar Inc.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the company's leading shareholder for the quarter.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In the case of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the company reported a better-than-expected Q3 as demand in mining, non-residential construction and energy remained healthy through the year even as recession fears grew. Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”8. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.

Dmitry Balyasny's Balyasny Asset Management was the company's biggest shareholder, with 2.27 million stakes worth $229.9 million.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) announced strong results led by strength in its commercial segment, but weakness in its defense business led to investor consternation.

Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.46 million shares worth $295.95 million.Mayar Capital mentioned 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53The Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta in March 1995, is an American aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with worldwide interests.

The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.

Rising Market Volatility — YF Tickers: ^VIX, ^VVIX, ^MOVEThe VIX (^VIX), also known as the ""fear index,"" measures investors' expectations of future (or ""implied"") volatility over the next 30 days in the S&amp;P 500. It is calculated based on transactions in options on the index itself.In general, higher stock index volatility tends to accompany selloffs, indicating ""fear"" in the market. Conversely, lower volatility is usually associated with stock market ralliesJust as the VIX measures stock market volatility, the VVIX (^VVIX) measures the volatility of the VIX itself. Sometimes, it will perk up and serve as an advance warning of moves in the underlying VIX.The ICE BofAML MOVE Index (^MOVE) index is the bond market's answer to the VIX. It is calculated once each day after the close, and so unlike the VIX the MOVE Index does not give intraday readings of volatility.Pro tip: An extreme upside VIX spike will usually accompany a huge down day in stocks — but that won't necessarily mark the low in stocks. If the VIX remains elevated, stocks can continue to drop as the VIX goes sideways, or even down itself. As the pros say, ""Don't confuse pace with direction.""Current status: The VIX shot above the 30 level last week as concerns over bank stress grew — only to crash Monday and Tuesday last week and remain lower into the news week, trading near 21.Story continuesThe MOVE index peaked at nearly 200 on March 20 — higher than the pandemic highs — and after cooling mid-week, surged on Friday amid investor fears over Deutsche Bank (DB), finishing the week above 170.A trader watches prices in the VIX pit at the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. exchange on February 6, 2018 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)2. Haven Flows — YF Tickers: JPY=X, EURJPY=XForeign exchange pairs measure the change in two currencies relative to one another. Typically, the ratio reflects differences in short-term interest rates between the two countries or areas.Relatively higher-rate countries tend to attract investment capital, while lower-rate jurisdictions are sources of funds to be borrowed and invested elsewhere — generally referred to as the carry trade.However, in times of stress, a premium is placed on developed market currencies — especially the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. Money flows from risky areas into these safe havens in what are called ""haven flows.""Over the last 30 years, the Bank of Japan has maintained the easiest monetary policy among developed nations. As a result, a favored macro trade is to borrow money in Japan, then invest it in the bonds of a higher-interest rate economy.Traders have historically looked to the EURJPY pair — pitting the euro against the yen — as a barometer of global risk tolerance. If the euro rises against the yen, the theory says riskier investments are in favor as money flows into Europe from Japan. Conversely, the pair often heads south when global risk surfaces and funds need a relatively ""safe"" home.Pitting the dollar against the yen is also useful to use as an early warning sign. With U.S. rates far above those in Japan, big flows into the yen — evidenced by a lower USDJPY — can be a red flag for overall risk tolerance when this pair drops quickly.Pro tip: The order of the currencies in their abbreviated ticker is made by convention, which can be confusing. For instance, the euro versus the dollar is typically expressed as EURUSD. Notably, Yahoo Finance omits the ""USD"" in forex tickers if it occurs first and appends an ""=X"" to all pairs. For instance, the Yahoo Finance ticker for USDJPY is JPY=X, for EURJPY, the ticker is EURJPY=X.Current status: Neither the euro nor the dollar is showing signs of sustained strong haven flows into the yen — though the yen has net strengthened since the SVB failure.3. Deteriorating Credit Markets — YF Tickers: HYG, JNKInvestors closely watch corporate credit markets for signs of weakness, as they are often first to show cracks in risk appetite. Corporate bonds are measured in how wide or tight their rates of interest are from the corresponding tenors of government debt. But stock investors don't need a fancy terminal to measure stress in corporate bonds.ETFs that track corporate credit — like the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) — can do the job.The ETFs track prices on a selection of corporate bonds, which move inversely to yield. In times of stress, when yields surge higher, the ETFs will nosedive, as they did during the pandemic and other periods of stress.Back in the early days of the pandemic, the Fed took the then-unprecedented step to support corporate credit markets by buying these two ETFs directly.If these ETFs do plummet again, watch out for quick, outsized reversals to the upside, which can indicate the Fed has taken action to support markets.Current status: HYG and JNK aren't currently reflecting or forecasting extreme market stress.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

First Citizens will pay $16.5B for SVB's $72B in loans and the transfer of all the bank’s deposits, worth $56B.Roughly $90B in Silicon Valley Bank’s securities and other assets were not included in that sale, and remain in the custody of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It was speculated that U.S. taxpayers could be on the hook for the $90B in unsold assets -- when asked if that scenario was likely in an interview with Yahoo Finance's Rachelle Akuffo, New York Times Business Investigations Editor David Enrich said, ""I don't think this is likely to be a huge taxpayer bailout... at least not compared to the bailouts we have seen in 2008, and even more recently with the pandemic era bill.""And as investors look for the next shoe to drop after Credit Suisse's emergency sale, many financial circles are pointing to Deutsche Bank (DB). Having written extensively about Deutsche Bank in his book 'Dark Towers,' Enrich said, ""Deutsche Bank is too big to fail. There's not a chance in hell that the German government or the ECB would let a bank of Deutsche Bank's size and prestige go down,"" though Enrich also said Deutsche Bank ""has been a problem child for a very long time now, and I think it's a natural place when investors look for the next bank to go down after Credit Suisse."" though he notes the bank is much more stable.Key video moments:00:00:53 Bank failures: Silicon Valley Bank vs. Signature Bank00:03:36 What to watch in the Senate banking hearings00:04:54 Taxpayers and SVB's unsold assetsWatch our full conversation with David Enrich here.]"

The bank is redeploying employees in its wealth management, banking and lending group to other roles within the company.According to people with knowledge of the matter, less than 200 employees have been offered different roles within the company, while some loan officers have been removed.The salaries of those affected have been kept as it is. But bonuses will depend on the new roles being assumed by each employee.A representative for BofA said in a statement, “As our business and client needs grow and evolve, our focus continues to be on aligning our team to areas of greatest need. Based on current market conditions, we are realigning talent to support these areas.”The Federal Reserve’s move to increase interest rates to tame the raging inflation has resulted in a slowdown in hiring across various lending businesses. Rapidly deteriorating economic conditions have also prompted lenders to build rainy-day funds for potential defaults.The interest rate hikes have battered the red-hot housing market, following which Wall Street firms like Wells Fargo &amp; Company WFC and JPMorgan JPM eliminated thousands of jobs in home lending.Last month, WFC cut hundreds of jobs in its mortgage unit as the company has been stepping back from the mortgage business. The reductions affected more than 500 employees, including mortgage bankers and home loan consultants.Markedly, in early January, WFC announced plans to create a more focused home lending business, and exit the correspondent lending business and prune servicing portfolio.Management noted, “Mortgage is an important relationship product, and our goal is to continue to be the primary mortgage lender to Wells Fargo bank customers as well as minority homebuyers. We are making the decision to continue to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing its size and narrowing its focus.”Likewise, it was reported that JPMorgan was letting go of hundreds of mortgage employees. JPM witnessed a 60% mortgage-origination volume slump last year.Story continuesOur TakeWhile higher rates are expected to aid BAC’s interest income and margins in the near term, the company’s over-dependence on the performance of the capital markets to generate fee income remains a matter of concern.Bank of America has been aligning its banking centers according to customer needs. It is on track to open 500 centers in new cities and redesign 2,500 centers with technology upgrades. The company is opening fully automated branches that will feature ATMs and video conferencing facilities, allowing customers to communicate with off-site bankers.These initiatives have enabled the company to improve digital offerings, and cross-sell several products, including mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.However, the volatile nature of the capital markets may adversely impact BAC’s non-interest income performance. Also, a tough operating backdrop will result in an increase in provisions.Over the past six months, shares of BofA have lost 12.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 5.1%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, Bank of America carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Mainz, Germany.BioNTech was relatively obscure until the company partnered with pharmaceutical juggernaut Pfizer (PFE) to develop one of the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine, called the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, has been authorized for emergency use in numerous countries around the world.Fundamental ViewThe COVID-19 pandemic was a windfall opportunity for BioNTech and other mRNA vaccine manufacturers. In the heat of the pandemic, BNTX’s EPS grew from zero to nearly $16 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe stock reacted accordingly, rising from $12 to over $400 a share in just months. However, unfortunately for BNTX investors, equities tend to be forward-looking devices rather than backward looking mechanisms. From that perspective, the picture is less rosy. This year, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that BNTX’s earnings will dive 70% year-over-year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s worse is that recent revisions are moving in the wrong direction. Over the past 90 days, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates have dropped precipitously. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTechnical View Sometimes, its important to focus on how a stock reacts to earnings, rather than the earnings themselves. Over the past two quarters, BNTX has beat consensus analyst estimates. However, shares are lagging and trading near multi-year lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRelatively speaking, BNTX is -25% over the past twelve months while the S&amp;P 500 is only -14%.Bottom LineBNTX is ranked a lowly 5 for a reason.

Or looking past it, at least, planning to invest the company’s pandemic windfall into the development of oncology products.The German biotech company is expecting the revenue from covid vaccines to go down pretty significantly this year. In fact, it has already began seeing the decline. In its financial results update, released on Monday (March 27,) BioNTech said revenue dropped from around $20.5 billion (about €19 billion as reported by the company) in 2021 to $18.6 billion in 2022. In its release announcing the results, BioNTech attributed the decline to the change in demand for covid vaccines.Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherBoth BioNTech’s partner Pfizer and its competitor Moderna saw higher revenue in 2022 than 2021, although they, too, expect the demand for covid vaccines to dwindle. Pfizer generated over $100 billion in revenue in 2022, compared to $81 billion in 2021, and its vaccine sales grew slightly by 3%. Moderna reported revenue of $19.3 billion in 2022, up from $18.5 billion in 2021, and attributed the increase to sales of the covid vaccine.Yet like BioNTech, Pfizer and Moderna are looking past covid, focusing on their cancer drug pipeline.Mid-term focus on cancerBioNTech’s revenue jumped from $551 million in 2020 to $20.5 billion in 2021 thanks to the covid vaccine. The biopharma company was the first to launch a bivalent, omicron-specific booster, and it entered a trial with Pfizer for a combined covid and influenza vaccine in October 2022. It expects the first results to be available later this year.BioNTech continues to adopt all measures to maximize profit from the vaccine, including opposing any plans to share vaccine technology with low-income countries, and investing instead in the shipment of pre-fabricated mobile factories to Rwanda. But its focus is shifting away from covid and external pathogen-induced treatment and toward oncology.Story continuesIn 2022, the company expanded its pipeline of cancer products, including 14 mRNA cancer technologies, to 20, which are involved in 24 clinical trials, of which five are stage two. These products explore the potential of mRNA technology to deliver a targeted, highly-individualized immune response to cancer. The company also researches antibody, engineered cells, and small molecule therapies. Despite the speed at which covid mRNA vaccine development happened, cancer vaccines won’t be ready in the immediate future. “Our mid-term goal is to seek approval for multiple oncology products in cancer indications with high unmet medical need,” BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin said in a statement.In February, the company entered an agreement with the UK government to start a trial of personalized mRNA cancer treatments. The trial is expected to begin by the fall and deliver 10,000 personalized treatments by 2030.Aside from its own research and development, BioNTech in 2022 entered a licensing agreement with OncoC4, a company developing an immune checkpoint modulator, or a type of drug-blocking protein made by certain cancer cells, and the company plans a stage three trial in 2023.More from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Brendan McDermid / Reuters)Ready took over as CEO in June 2022 after a career spanning tech giants such as PayPal (PYPL) and Google (GOOGL).The tech veteran is tapping into his commerce experience, and told Yahoo Finance Live he is focused on making Pinterest a more ""shoppable"" platform to drive sales and grow the user base.Pinterest CEO Bill Ready (right) says AI will be key in unlocking value from the social media platform. (Yahoo Finance)Ready explained that further refinements to Pinterest's AI will be key to unlocking the platform's potential.""I think a lot of this discussion about AI has missed how important it is in what signal the AI is acting upon,"" he said. ""The AI is only as good as the signal that it acts upon. And for Pinterest, we have hundreds of millions of pinners that come to Pinterest every day and curate what a great outfit looks like, what a great room design looks like in a certain aesthetic. And we are able to have our AI act upon billions of interactions from pinners that make these product associations, which is very different than what you'd find on any other social media platform or really any other shopping platform.""Story continuesThese efforts around AI, coupled with fresh cost cuts, are expected to drive margin expansion this year for Pinterest in the face of an ad sales market that Ready says is still ""choppy.""Pinterest sees first-quarter sales growing by a low-single-digit percentage year over year. Expenses are forecast to drop by low double digits.Pinterest stock is up more than 20% year-to-date, outpacing the performance of the Nasdaq Composite, as Wall Street waits for accelerated user growth.""Overall, we remain neutral-rated while we watch for the new CEO’s impact on MAUs and the overall user experience, along w/ improved monetization, while driving cost efficiencies, all into an uncertain macro environment,"" JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Expanding on the popular MyGroup feature — which enables patrons of the Masters digital platforms to watch every shot, on every hole, from all their favorite players — the AI commentary solution will produce detailed golf narration for more than 20,000 video clips over the course of the Tournament. It is the latest example of how IBM and the Masters are working together to create digital fan experiences that offer unparalleled access and in-depth insights into every moment of the Tournament, from the first drive on the first tee to the final putt on the 18th green.Experts from IBM iX, the experience design partner within IBM Consulting, worked with the Masters digital team to leverage multiple foundation models — including IBM Watson Text-to-Speech – to train the AI in the unique language of golf at the Masters, automating the process of adding spoken commentary to video clips. Generative AI built on foundation models was applied to produce narration with varied sentence structure and vocabulary, avoiding redundant play-by-play iterations to make the clips informative and engaging.Also new to the Tournament this year, IBM will introduce hole-by-hole player predictions. To project a player's score on each hole for the entire Tournament, the IBM Consulting team leveraged AutoAI capabilities in IBM Watson Studio to train AI models using six years of Masters data — more than 120,000 golf shots. After the completion of a given hole, the hole-by-hole projections are updated to reflect the most recent performance of the player. The new solution expands on the predictive intelligence of the popular Players Insights and Masters Fantasy Projections feature, which turns data into insights around the most exciting holes to watch for every golfer, the low/high score for all golfers, and projected Masters Fantasy points for every round.Story continues""For more than twenty years, IBM and the Masters have partnered together to create custom solutions that improve the user experience and capture the attention of millions of golf fans globally,"" said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications for IBM. ""We're applying the same hybrid cloud, AI technology and IBM Consulting services that we use with clients across industries to bring an elevated digital experience to one of the most iconic sporting events in the world.""Timed to this year's Tournament, IBM will launch the next iteration of its ""Let's create"" brand initiative, ""What if?"". Conceptualized and executed by Ogilvy, ""What if?"" underscores the importance of asking big questions that can lead to the creation of equally big technology solutions. The spots were filmed by ProdCo's Ian Pons Jewell, featuring Golden Globe-winning and Emmy-nominated actor and producer Oscar Isaac as the voice over interacting with people in each scene. One installment of the four distinct ads includes rising golfer and 87th Masters Tournament invitee Kurt Kitayama and sports commentator Jim Nantz, who bring this creative concept to life through the lens of IBM's collaborative partnership with the Masters. In addition to the Masters, the campaign is inspired by IBM's work with a range of clients across sustainability, supply chain, and data analytics and security, demonstrating how IBM is helping organizations drive innovation, transformation, and enhanced customer experiences. The campaign begins April 5 across broadcast, connected TV, digital video, print and social.IBM has been the digital partner of the Masters for more than 25 years, working closely to bring unparalleled experiences to the global Masters audience. Starting with the launch of Masters.com in 1996, the Masters has collaborated with IBM on a journey to the hybrid cloud to streamline workloads and deliver new fan experiences through cloud and AI technologies. The implementation of that technology has been showcased continually, including through the introduction of AI Highlights, Round in Under Three Minutes, MyGroup, Player Insights and Projections powered with IBM Watson.The 87th Masters Tournament will be played from April 6-9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, GA.

208,341bd239-b750-3dbb-b586-56e2384d939f,IBM,2023-03-28,12 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-cybersecurity-110718286.html,1680001638,STORY,"['MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'IBM', 'AMZN']","[In this article, we take a look at the 12 most advanced countries in cybersecurity. For more such countries, go to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Cybersecurity. Cyberspace is increasingly being considered the fifth dimension of warfare after land, sea, air and space. Interest in cybersecurity has increased during recent years for both offensive and defensive purposes, as battlefield and strategic-weapons management, and military operational coordination is increasingly happening in cyberspace. In this respect, cyberspace has paved the way for strategic offensive advantages in its domain, and necessitated defensive capabilities and cyber resilience as well. The US, in this regard, has launched the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, through its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). CISA is expected to have its funding increased by 12% in FY2023, reaching $2.9 billion, which is $313 million above the funding it received in the last fiscal year. The budget is expected to help CISA enhance its threat hunting, cyber-vulnerability management and cybersecurity training programs. When it comes to the organization’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative program, it is enlisting several major tech corporations like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to help improve its cybersecurity infrastructure. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is known for the widely used security system called Microsoft Sentinel, which delivers across-enterprise threat intelligence. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also known for Priva, Purview and Entra, among other advanced security solutions.Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), on the other hand, boasts cloud-based security solutions like Cloud IDS, VPC Service Controls and Confidential Computing, among Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s top solutions. Lastly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) integrates various top-notch cybersecurity services in its Amazon Web Services cloud.Story continuesCybersecurity Trends to Watch: 2030Among the cybersecurity trends for 2030 highlighted by the World Economic Forum, concerns surrounding the abuse of AI capabilities in cyber threats were the most noteworthy in terms of malware, ransomware, online social engineering and propaganda. Machine learning is advancing at a rapid pace and AI can be used to create malware that is more difficult to detect and harder to remove. For example, attackers can use AI to create polymorphic malware that changes its code every time it infects a new system.Machine learning models can also be used to carry out more sophisticated and effective ransomware attacks. Attackers can use AI to identify valuable targets and customize their ransom demands based on the target's financial situation.Cybersecurity Industry Outlook: 2030According to a report by Grand View Research, the global cybersecurity market was valued at $203 billion as of 2022, and is projected to grow at a solid CAGR of 12.3% during the forecast period of 2023-2030, reaching $500.7 billion in value by 2030. Factors driving the growth include an increasing number of cyberattacks, cloud computing and losses that firms are incurring due to cyberattacks, motivating them to seek cybersecurity solutions. According to a report by International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), the global average cost that companies incur due to data breaches is $4.35 million as of 2021. Since the International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) report, data breaches have increased by 13%, with 83% of the studied organizations having their data breached more than once. One of the problems highlighted in the industry by the Grand View Research report is the high costs of cybersecurity solutions, compelling many enterprises to seek unlicensed solutions, which although work against known threats, are ineffective against novel threats, and are often carrying trojans themselves. The GVR report further highlighted that the hardware segment, within the broader cybersecurity industry, is growing at a high growth rate of over 12%. On the other hand, the cloud security segment held the highest share of revenue in 2022, at over 25%. Defense contracts accounted for more than 20% of the global market, and when it comes to regional cybersecurity markets, Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing. Many countries have advanced highly in cybersecurity, primarily for military purposes, like Israel. It is popularly known for Pegasus spyware developed by NSO Group. Pegasus is a suite of exploits that targets many different vulnerabilities in computer systems. Israel was also among the countries which were accused by Iran for the Stuxnet attack, which sabotaged Iranian centrifuges. Israel has a formidable reputation in cybersecurity and ranks on the top 19th spot on the Belfer Center’s National Cyber Power Index of 2022. It is particularly ahead in dimensions like destructive and defensive cyber capabilities but lags behind many other countries in the financial and information-control dimensions of cybersecurity. With the backdrop, let’s head to the 12 most advanced countries in cybersecurity. 12 Most Advanced Countries in CybersecurityPhoto by Jefferson Santos on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe have defined ‘advanced countries in cybersecurity’ as ones which are well-equipped in cyberspace in terms of infrastructure and talent, and boast high capability and readiness in the industry for both defense and industry-related purposes.In this respect, we’ve relied on the National Cyber Power Index of 2022 by Cyber Project and ranked the countries as such, in ascending order of high advancement in cybersecurity. Here are the 12 most advanced countries in cybersecurity. 12. UkraineUkraine boasts capabilities in threat intelligence and cyber defense, developed as a reaction to the country being a target of numerous cyberattacks, including the NotPetya ransomware attack. In 2016, Ukraine created a National Cybersecurity Coordination Center to facilitate cooperation between government agencies, private companies, and international partners in addressing cyber threats. Additionally, Ukraine has developed a number of initiatives to promote cybersecurity education and training, including the establishment of specialized universities and training programs.Ukraine is also home to a number of leading cybersecurity companies, including Ciklum, a global software engineering and technology company that specializes in cybersecurity, and whose board is chaired in Kyiv, and SoftServe, a digital-solutions company which offers a range of cybersecurity services. 11.

For me, that's the biggest thing about working for a big company like this.""That was enough to convince Kirk to apply for a truck driving job hauling crude oil. With her CDL and driving experience, she landed the job with the same fleet in Roosevelt, Utah, where her brother worked. As her trainer, Wilson gave her a good review, but as her brother, he couldn't resist teasing her a little.Story continues""She was a good student,"" said Wilson, who helped train Kirk to drive a truck with double trailers. ""I didn't kick her out of the truck, so she must have been all right.""Kirk said she did have to learn how to do some of the work differently, since she doesn't have the same upper body strength that her male colleagues do. Her brother was there to show her different ways to do things like chain up the tires.Kirk has made a successful career out of driving trucks. She's been with the company for more than seven years, and she hopes that other women will consider truck driving as a career that offers consistency, better pay and great benefits.""I'm 51. My health is good enough that when I retire, I'll be able to enjoy that stage of life. I'm fortunate that I have a 401(k) that the company has contributed to and a pension. This career definitely changed my outlook on what the future holds.""Now that her children are grown, she's proud of what she's accomplished in the field and so is her family.""The grandboys think it's awesome that grandma drives a big truck,"" said Kirk. ""My oldest son drives a truck now. My daughter drives the pilot truck for oversize loads. That was partially because I drive a truck. I guess it's in our blood.""Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Monday, March 27, 2023, Press release pictureKirk has made a successful career out of driving trucks.

214,3dede84b-bc00-31d7-9267-00c5db9c6029,GM,2023-03-28,UPDATE 2-New UAW leader tells automakers: 'Our membership is fed up',Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-u-auto-union-leader-203644773.html,1679949404,STORY,['GM'],"[(Adds comments)By Joseph White and David ShepardsonDETROIT, March 27 (Reuters) - Shawn Fain, the new president of the United Auto Workers union, on Monday said workers at the Detroit Three automakers are ""fed up with the status quo"" and prepared to fight in contract talks this fall.""You're going to see a lot more aggressive UAW,"" Fain told reporters late Monday after a day-long meeting with local union officials.Fain was declared the UAW's president on Saturday. He won a closely-contested race against incumbent Ray Curry by fewer than 500 votes, according to the count administered by a court appointed monitor.Now, Fain faces the task of unifying UAW members for what promises to be difficult negotiations this summer and fall with the Detroit Three automakers - Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Stellantis NV's.""Our members are not getting their fair share,"" Fain said during a briefing with reporters when asked about the potential for a strike. ""If these companies don’t change their position we will use every resource we have.""Fain said there is ""no excuse"" for the decision by Chrysler-parent Stellantis NV to indefinitely idle a Jeep plant in Belvidere, Illinois. UAW officials are discussing the situation with the company, he said. ""We aren't playing around.""The auto sector talks come as the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign begins to heat up. U.S. President Joe Biden and other Democrats are appealing to the UAW and its members for votes in Michigan, a 2024 swing state.Michigan Democratic U.S. Senator Gary Peters told attendees at Monday's convention that EV batteries and chips should be built by union labor.ROBUST PROFITSFain said during his campaign that he will fight for substantial changes to the current master contracts with the Detroit automakers, and he reiterated that message to UAW bargaining convention delegates on Monday.""The United Auto Workers are ready to get back in the fight,"" Fain said.Story continuesOn the UAW president's agenda are ending the current two-tier wage system under which new hires at Detroit Three plants earn 25% less than UAW workers with five or more years on the job.Fain has also called for reinstatement of cost of living adjustments, or COLA, to offset inflation, no concessions on health benefits and no U.S. plant closings.The UAW last year negotiated 10% wage increases in the first year of a six-year agreement with farm equipment maker John Deere. That contract was ratified after a six-week strike. Earlier this month, UAW workers at heavy equipment maker Caterpillar ratified a six-year contract providing for 27% wage increases over its life.Those contracts could be models for the UAW's goals in talks with the Detroit automakers beginning this summer, analysts said.The Detroit automakers have reported robust profits during the past four years from their North American operations, mainly thanks to the pickup trucks and SUVs that UAW members assemble.However, North American operations for the Detroit Three automakers are under pressure as they pour billions into electric vehicles and battery production. All three companies have moved to cut costs, reducing salaried staff or, in Stellantis' case, idling a U.S. assembly plant.Securing UAW jobs as the Detroit automakers shift toward electric vehicles is a ""top priority,"" Fain said. ""We are already behind in this battle.""The UAW and Detroit automakers will begin bargaining toward new contracts this summer. The current contracts expire on Sept. 14. Usually, the UAW concludes an agreement with one Detroit automaker and uses that as the pattern for contracts at the other two. For the first time in many years, Canadian auto workers will also be negotiating new contracts with the Detroit Three at the same time.In 2019, UAW workers at General Motors went on strike for 40 days before a new contract was ratified, costing the automaker $3 billion.

In constant currency, sales increased 5%. Both comparisons include a 2% unfavorable impact from the Company's Kitchen Basics divestiture, the exit of the Company's Consumer business in Russia, and lower China consumption due to COVID-related disruption.Operating income was $199 million in the first quarter compared to $207 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income of $227 million was comparable to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 2% from the year-ago period. Earnings per share was $0.52 in the first quarter as compared to $0.57 in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.59 as compared to $0.63 in the year-ago period. For fiscal year 2023, McCormick reaffirmed its sales, operating income, and earnings per share outlook.Chairman and CEO's Remarks Lawrence E. Kurzius, Chairman and CEO, stated, ""We delivered solid first quarter results which reflect strong demand and early results from our actions to increase our profit realization in 2023. Our first quarter record sales performance reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio and the effective execution of our strategies. Our Global Operating Effectiveness (GOE) program is yielding results with first quarter cost savings in line with our expectations. The progress we are making on gross margin improvement reflects the level of urgency with which we are addressing the pressure points from last year. These results, combined with the strong demand we continue to expect across our portfolio and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure, bolster our confidence in delivering our 2023 full year outlook.Story continues""In the first quarter, we drove 5% constant currency sales growth with strong underlying business performance tempered by the impacts of our Kitchen Basics divestiture, COVID-related disruption in China, and the exit of our Consumer business in Russia. Our Flavor Solutions segment sales growth was outstanding with continued momentum across all three regions. The underlying performance of our Consumer segment, excluding the Kitchen Basics, China, and Russia impacts, reflects strong growth led by the Americas region. Importantly, beginning in the second quarter, as we lap the exit of our Consumer business in Russia and the impact of last year's COVID-related shutdowns in China, we expect an acceleration of our Consumer segment growth.""We drove considerable improvement in our gross margin performance in the first quarter, despite experiencing the highest cost inflation we expect for the year as well as continued elevated costs in our Flavor Solutions segment to meet high demand. Our gross margin reflects the continued recovery of the cost inflation our pricing lagged last year as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. The optimization of our costs through our GOE program is progressing as planned. We expect the impact of our GOE program to scale-up as the year progresses and we remain on track to realize $75 million of cost savings in 2023 resulting from our actions to normalize our supply chain costs and to streamline our organization.""As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure, and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. We have strong growth plans in place, including building momentum with our new products and heat platform, and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We are confident, with the successful execution of our proven strategies, we will drive profitable growth in 2023.""I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. I want to also thank all our customers, suppliers and investors for their collaboration and patience as we move beyond the unique environment we have been operating in since the onset of the pandemic. The fundamentals that drove our historical financial performance remain strong and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace.""First Quarter 2023 ResultsMcCormick reported 3% sales growth in the first quarter from the year-ago period, or 5% in constant currency. Constant currency sales growth reflected an 11% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 2% volume decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture, lower China consumption due to COVID-related disruption, and the exit of the Consumer business in Russia, as well as a 3% decline in all other volume and product mix.Gross profit margin declined 80 basis points versus the first quarter of last year. This decline was driven by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs partially offset by pricing actions and cost savings led by the Company's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) and GOE programs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were comparable to the year-ago period with higher distribution costs offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings as well as lower brand marketing and employee benefit expenses. Operating income declined to $199 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $207 million in the first quarter of 2022 driven by higher special charges. Excluding special charges, as well as integration expenses in 2022, adjusted operating income of $227 million was comparable to the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 2% in the first quarter from the year-ago period driven by the favorable impact of higher sales partially offset by gross margin compression.Earnings per share was $0.52 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $0.57 in the first quarter of 2022. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.07 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $0.06 in the year-ago period. Excluding these impacts, adjusted earnings per share was $0.59 in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $0.63 in the year-ago period. This decrease was driven by higher interest expense and a higher adjusted effective tax rate.Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2023 was $103 million compared to $18 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation payments.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Outlook For fiscal year 2023, McCormick reaffirmed its financial outlook which was previously issued with the Company's fourth quarter 2022 results on January 26, 2023.McCormick's broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio enables the Company to meet the rising demand for flavor around the world. The Company is capitalizing on the growing consumer interests in healthy and flavorful cooking, digital engagement, valuing trusted brands, and purpose-minded practices. This, coupled with the breadth and reach of McCormick's portfolio and its proven strategies, positions the Company to sustainably continue its growth trajectory.McCormick expects strong underlying business performance in 2023 driven by sales growth. The Company also expects a favorable impact to operating income from its GOE program and the lapping of the negative impact of the COVID-related disruptions in China in 2022, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and an expected increase in employee incentive compensation expenses given the expected improvement in underlying business performance. In addition, the Company expects earnings per share growth will be tempered by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate compared to 2022. Excluding this interest and tax headwind, McCormick's operating performance growth is expected to be strong. The Company expects minimal impact on net sales, operating income, and earnings per share from currency rates in 2023.In 2023, McCormick expects to grow sales by 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The Company expects sales growth to be driven primarily by pricing actions, which in conjunction with cost savings, are expected to offset inflationary pressures. McCormick also expects to drive continued growth through the strength of its brands, as well as brand marketing, new products, category management, and differentiated customer engagement plans.Operating income in 2023 is expected to grow by 10% to 12% from $864 million in 2022. The Company anticipates approximately $50 million of special charges in 2023 that relate to previous organizational and streamlining actions. Excluding the impact of special charges and integration expenses in 2023 and 2022, adjusted operating income is expected to increase 9% to 11%.McCormick projects 2023 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.42 to $2.47, compared to $2.52 of earnings per share in 2022. The Company expects special charges to lower earnings per share by $0.14 in 2023. Excluding these impacts, the Company projects 2023 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.61, compared to $2.53 of adjusted earnings per share in 2022, which represents an expected increase of 1% to 3%. This reflects strong operating performance, partially offset by an 8% headwind from higher interest expense due to the higher interest-rate environment and lapping the impact of an optimization of the Company's debt portfolio last year, as well as a 1% headwind from an anticipated increase in the Company's projected adjusted effective tax rate. For fiscal 2023, the Company expects strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and anticipates returning a significant portion of cash flow to shareholders through dividends.Business Segment Results Consumer Segment(in millions)Three months ended2/28/20232/28/2022Net sales$        909.5$        926.1Operating income, excluding special charges, transaction and      integration expenses173.4167.0Consumer segment sales declined 2% from the first quarter of 2022.

Consumer segment growth was driven by the Americas region.Consumer sales in the Americas increased 3% from the first quarter of 2023, or 4% in constant currency. The increase was driven by pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 2% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture.Consumer sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) declined 9% compared to the year-ago period. In constant currency, sales decreased 2% with lower volume and product mix partially offset by pricing actions. The sales decline includes a 4% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia.Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region declined 15% compared to the year-ago period. In constant currency, sales declined 8% driven by a decline in volume partially offset by pricing actions. The combination of lower volume in China due to COVID-related disruptions and the exit of lower margin business in India drove an 11% reduction in volume.Consumer segment operating income, excluding transaction and integration expenses, as well as special charges, increased 4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the year-ago period. In constant currency, operating income increased 6%. Pricing actions, CCI-led and GOE cost savings more than offset the impact of higher cost inflation and distribution expenses as well as lower volume.Flavor Solutions Segment(in millions)Three months ended2/28/20232/28/2022Net sales$        656.0$        596.3Operating income, excluding special charges, transaction and      integration expenses53.460.1Flavor Solutions segment sales increased 10% from the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, the outstanding sales growth of 12% reflected a 13% increase from pricing actions and a 1% decline in volume and product mix. Flavor Solutions growth was led by the Americas and EMEA regions.In the Americas, Flavor Solutions sales rose 13% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, sales increased 12% with pricing actions offset by lower volume and product mix.The EMEA region's Flavor Solutions sales increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, sales increased 17% with pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix.The Asia/Pacific region's Flavor Solutions sales declined 1% compared to the first quarter of 2022. In constant currency, sales increased 5%. This increase was driven by pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix.Flavor Solutions segment operating income, excluding transaction and integration expenses, as well as special charges, was 11% lower in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the year-ago period, with minimal impact from currency. The decrease was driven by higher cost inflation, elevated costs to meet high demand, and spending related to supply chain investments. These impacts were partially offset by higher sales, pricing actions, and CCI-led and GOE cost savings.Non-GAAP Financial Measures The tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:Special charges – In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned ""Special charges"" in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses and income associated with certain actions undertaken by the Company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion.Transaction and integration expenses – We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions and their subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs, which we refer to as ""Transaction and integration expenses"", include transaction costs associated with each acquisition, as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition, including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventories, together with the impact of discrete tax items, if any, directly related to each acquisition.Gain on sale of Kitchen Basics - We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of the Kitchen Basics business in August 2022. As more fully described in note 17 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2022, the pre-tax gain associated with the sale was $49.6 million and is included in Other income, net in our consolidated income statement for the year ended November 30, 2022.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures is provided below:(in millions except per share data)Three Months Ended2/28/20232/28/2022Operating income$  199.0$ 206.9Impact of transaction and integration expenses—0.7Impact of special charges27.819.5Adjusted operating income$  226.8$ 227.1% decrease versus year-ago period(0.1) %Adjusted operating income margin (1)14.5 %14.9 %Income tax expense $    34.4$   34.4Impact of transaction and integration expenses—0.2Impact of special charges6.54.9Adjusted income tax expense$    40.9$   39.5Adjusted income tax rate (2)21.8 %19.7 %Net income$  139.1$ 154.9Impact of transaction and integration expenses—0.5Impact of special charges21.314.6Adjusted net income$  160.4$ 170.0% decrease versus year-ago period(5.6) %Earnings per share - diluted$    0.52$   0.57Impact of special charges 0.070.06Adjusted earnings per share - diluted$    0.59$   0.63% decrease versus year-ago period(6.3) %(1)Adjusted operating income margin is calculated as adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.(2)Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges of $187.3 million and $200.2 million for the three months ended February 28, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed ""on a constant currency basis"", is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the comparative year.

You can skip our industry overview and go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Growth Stocks Now.Growth stocks refer to listed companies that are growing their profits, revenue, or cash flow at a rate that exceeds their competitors and beats the overall market. Generally, these stocks are associated with new companies that are disrupting their industries and own intellectual property that gives them a competitive advantage. Companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) are good examples of growth stocks.Growth stocks have their unique attributes, while they rarely pay dividends or generate high profits, they are able to grow their business at a high rate. In Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s case, the company only managed to become profitable in 2020, and despite experiencing significant profit growth since then, it hasn’t distributed dividends to its shareholders. The company’s website clearly states that it does not anticipate ever issuing such a dividend because it “[intends] on retaining all future earnings to finance future growth.”However, growth investors are not really invested in the stocks for dividends. The primary investment purpose of investing in growth stocks is benefiting from the rise in the stock price as the company continues on its growth trajectory. An investment of $1,000 in Tesla five years ago would now be worth about $5,000, representing a remarkable gain of 400%.15 Most Profitable Growth Stocks NowBeach Holiday, Hotel, Tourist Resort, Making a Reservation, GrowthGrowth stocks tend to have longer-term cash flow horizons and are, therefore, more sensitive to long-term interest rates. When interest rates rise, growth stocks lose value because the discount rate used for the valuation of these stocks increases, leaving investors with a smaller present value. Hence in a rising rate environment like today, growth stocks tend to suffer the most, in contrast, value stocks become more appealing during these times due to the nature of their businesses. However, an economic downturn provides a good opportunity for investors to hand-pick good growth stocks for the future because, rest assured, as the economic cycle takes a turn for the better, growth stocks tend to lead the market rallies and provide investors with substantial gains.Story continuesIn January 2022, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) briefly hit a $3 trillion valuation. But then, as the interest rate hikes were introduced, prices declined to erode $1 trillion from its valuation by the end of the year. Similarly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw its share price decline by 30%. In 2022, while the S&amp;P 500 was down by about 18%, the S&amp;P 500 growth index fell by 30.1%, reflecting the effect of higher interest rates on growth stocks.In 2023, the interest rate is expected to increase up to 5.25% or even 5.5%. But analysts expect tech firms or at least FAANG stocks to bounce back. For example, analysts predict the share price of Meta (NASDAQ:META) to rise by 8%, given that now the company has announced cost-cutting measures. If these forecasts are correct, then anyone buying the tech stock at the current prices could hope to make a good gain later in the year.Our MethodologyTo come up with 15 most profitable growth stocks now, we have used stock screeners to identify high growth profitable stocks. We filtered the stocks with at least $500 million in market capitalization and revenue growth of at least 30% YoY. The year-over-year growth metric used to screen companies calculates the percentage change from the trailing twelve months’ revenues compared to the twelve months prior. We then proceeded to rank the companies in ascending order of their Net Profit (TTM).15 Most Profitable Growth Stocks Now15. Super Micro Computer, Inc.

Both models feature the bowl-lift function and come in the same color, but the Costco version is priced at $399.99.Story continuesRamhold believes that the Costco option is a great deal, offering many of the perks of the professional-grade model at a $50 discount.Dyson Vacuum CleanersAt Target, the Dyson V15 Detect Cordless Vacuum Cleaner is priced at $749.99; on Amazon, it is available for $698.According to Target superfan Garrett Smith of GMB Gorilla, it is more practical to purchase household gadgets like this on Amazon due to their better discounts, sales and free shipping. Smith pointed out that these factors can make a significant difference in savings.BooksTarget doesn’t offer a huge selection of books and rarely offers discounts, while places such as Barnes &amp; Nobles, Amazon and Bookshop.org, do.“Probably most importantly with books, it’s best to shop around to find the best price and spend your money at places that uplift authors and support your community,” said Target superfan Sarah Meads. “I love independent book retailers and places like Bookshop.org, an online bookstore that allows customers to purchase books while supporting independent bookstores.”​​Beauty ProductsThe prices of beauty products at Target can vary depending on the brand and product type. However, some customers have reported that certain name-brand beauty products can be more expensive at Target compared to other retailers.For example, some customers have noted that certain skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and CeraVe, can be priced higher at Target compared to retailers such as Ulta or Amazon. Similarly, some makeup brands, such as Nars and Urban Decay, might be priced higher at Target compared to other retailers.GroceriesThe pricing of groceries at Target can be dependent on item and location, and there are cases where specific grocery products are more expensive at Target than at other stores.“I don’t love buying my fresh produce at Target and also avoid name-brand cereals, snacks and beverages,” Meads said.When it comes to groceries, as always, it pays to be prepared and shop around. And don’t forget rewards programs.ClothingWhile Target has a lot of on-trend and designer capsule collection clothing, it’s not the most inexpensive place to get staples. For example, a woman’s V-neck shirt costs $10 at Target. But if you buy the same item at Walmart, it’ll be just $2.98. That’s a $7 savings on an everyday dressing staple.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsGet Top Travel Tips To Help You Save MoreHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 7 Most Overpriced Target Items, According to Superfans]"

""So consumables and health that make up over 80% of our sales remain pillars of strength. Consumers aren't trading down, and they aren't sacrificing their pet's needs.""""Where they are cautious is in discretionary spend,"" Singh said, adding that consumers have pulled back in areas such as pet toys.A police dog carries a tennis ball in his mouth at The All England Tennis Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on July 2, 2019, on the second day of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships tennis tournament. (Photo by DANIEL LEAL/AFP via Getty Images) (DANIEL LEAL via Getty Images)Amid a mixed economic backdrop, Singh is pushing Chewy into its first international market and automating more of its U.S. distribution centers.Singh declined to comment on what Chewy's first international market will be (it will be revealed in May) but said that the expansion stands to unlock more growth for the e-commerce player over the long term, even as it weighs on profit margins near-term.""We believe the brand is resilient outside the United States,"" Singh said. ""In terms of the investment curve, look, these are strategic investments, and we are long-term oriented.""Chewy CEO Sumit Singh eyes international expansion for the pet products player. (Yahoo Finance)Despite more cautious consumers, Chewy notched a solid fourth-quarter report last week.Net sales increased 13.4% from a year ago to $2.71 billion. Gross profit margin expanded 270 basis points from a year earlier to 28.1%. And adjusted operating profits increased by $120.1 million from a year ago.However, the Street took issue with a slight active customer decline sequentially and a potential near-term margin hit from international expansion. Chewy stock was down 12% last week in the wake of the company's earnings report.Some analysts are taking a wait-and-see approach on the stock, pending a reacceleration in active customers — in line with Chewy's guidance.Story continues""The intrinsic value of the business is much more sensitive to the terminal margin assumption than the size of the revenue base, and while 2022 gave us more confidence in a ~mid-single digit percentage EBITDA margin over the medium-term, the beginning of international expansion coupled with still weak net adds and less pricing upside from here leave us more cautious,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Lauren Schenk wrote.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$72b last week after a 4.3% drop in the share price. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 27% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Target which might hurt individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Target. View our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Target already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Target, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Target is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 7.2% of the company stock.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of TargetThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Target Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$187m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Target. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) shareholders have enjoyed a 89% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 47% (not including dividends).Since the stock has added US$4.2b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Intuitive Surgical managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 14%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Intuitive Surgical's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.A Different PerspectiveIntuitive Surgical shareholders are down 14% over twelve months, which isn't far from the market return of -14%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 14% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. Before forming an opinion on Intuitive Surgical you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(ISRG) shares rallied 4.9% in the last trading session to close at $256.42. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 4.1% gain over the past four weeks.Improving earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2023 during the past 30 days is likely driving the share price of the company higher.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.5%. Revenues are expected to be $1.58 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc., the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

While the stock has lost 15.9% over the past four weeks, there is light at the end of the tunnel as it is now in oversold territory and Wall Street analysts expect the company to report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for NAVIThe heavy selling of NAVI shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 28.2. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NAVI has increased 0.3%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, NAVI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

V has reportedly increased its offer for a Brazilian cloud-based platform provider for banking services and payments, Pismo. Per Valor Economico, Visa’s original offer of $1 billion was rejected by the partners in the Sao Paulo-based technology company, against which the company raised the offer to $1.4 billion.Pismo, backed by Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Softbank, is on the right path to global expansion. It has opened offices in the United States and the U.K. The company has expanded its operations in India and Singapore, which is likely to fuel its long-term growth. The potential acquisition will add Pismo’s assets to Visa, enabling the payments juggernaut to continue its inorganic growth strategy.Per Pipeline, Visa is facing competition for Pismo’s lucrative assets. It processes 74 million accounts, which jumped 30% in the past six months. It has also reached the milestone of 38 million cards processed. Pismo’s series B fundraising of $108 million in October 2021 highlighted its growth path. Even though the company did not provide any valuation, the estimated valuation of the company was within $600-$700 million then, per Valor Economico.For Visa, mergers and acquisitions, partnerships, and minority investments are some of the ways to achieve growth. The company consistently makes efforts to expand its Latin America footprint. These moves help the company to maintain its leading position in the payment network space.

VZ recently introduced a 30-day free trial offer for unlimited data on its 5G network. The offer is applicable on any 5G compatible, unlocked eSIM-capable smartphone without disrupting the existing plan.The promotional offer, aimed primarily at non-Verizon customers, is likely to entice users who would prefer to enjoy the premium 5G network experience without any contractual obligations. The company expects that its super-fast network will likely attract and retain several new customers and augment its user base through lucrative mix-and-match unlimited plans. Verizon is offering various mix-and-match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans that have historically led to increased adoption of 5G devices and premium unlimited plans, translating into healthy customer additions.Last week, Verizon also announced the launch of BlueJeans Basic, a free virtual video conferencing plan for users that allows attendees to meet as long as they want. The new feature by Verizon subsidiary, BlueJeans, which offers an interoperable cloud-based video conferencing service across a wide range of devices and conferencing platforms, is aimed to facilitate a seamless transition to a hybrid workplace with a spontaneous and engaging interactive digital platform.BlueJeans Basic allows up to 25 persons to meet on a single platform equipped with HD video, spatial audio, industry-leading noise reduction and dynamic leveling for impeccable call quality. Leveraging AES 256-bit encryption, BlueJeans Basic also includes enterprise-grade security features like Waiting Room, Screen Sharing Controls and the option to Hard Mute participants individually or upon entering the meeting.Although such promotional offers and lucrative discounts are likely to expand its customer base, these are weighing on margins. In addition, the company’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from the voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data and video) offerings by cable companies. Verizon also recorded high capital expenditures for the launch and continued build-out of its 5G Ultra-Wideband network, deployment of significant fiber assets across the country and upgrade to Intelligent Edge Network architecture. It remains unclear if and when a reasonable return can be achieved from such investments.Nevertheless, with one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States, Verizon deploys the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies to deliver faster peak data speeds and capacity for customers, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and constant strategic investment. Its 5G mobility service offers an unparalleled experience that impacts industries as diverse as public safety, health care, retail and sports. The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These are massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells.The stock has lost 26.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 14.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:24% = US$22b ÷ US$92b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.24 in profit.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good ROE?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Verizon Communications has a better ROE than the average (7.9%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Verizon Communications' Debt And Its 24% Return On EquityVerizon Communications clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.66. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

Said another way, without water, humans cannot survive very long. In the stock market, the elements that comprise a true market leader are strong price and volume trends. Without these two critical ingredients, a stock is unlikely to trend higher.Monitoring price and volume (or supply and demand) is vital for an investor because it can provide valuable insights into the behavior of the general market and individual equities, such as clues of:·      Institutional Accumulation: When a stock shoots higher on expanding price and volume, it can be a clue that an institution is accumulating a position. For example, after its last earnings report, Nvidia gapped higher by 14% on volume 129% above the norm.Nvidia traded a mind-blowing 111 million shares in the session. Because such a large number of shares is impossible for retail investors to buy, the demand was indicative of institutional investors like mutual funds, banks, and pension funds. Remember, institutions move stocks, not retail.·      A Strong Pullback: As any experienced investor knows, no stock goes straight up. For this reason, investors can gain valuable information by monitoring how a stock pulls back. Shallow pullbacks on low volume are a sign of digestion, not downward conviction. Often, the strength of a stock is revealed in the pullback, not the advance, such as in the case of Advanced Micro Devices.·      Weak Rallies: When a stock moves higher on low volume, it should raise cautionary flags for investors. Rallies like this signify that while the stock is moving higher, conviction is low. A good recent example is Walker Dunlop.Story continuesTakeawaySimilar to how a doctor consoles an X-Ray for pertinent information, investors look to price and volume charts to reveal important patterns. Charts help investors to identify institutional accumulation from low conviction accumulation. Furthermore, they allow investors to separate strong pullbacks from weak ones.

The exact placement of those transistors has a big impact on the chip's cost, speed and power consumption.Chip design engineers use complex design software from firms like Synopsys Inc and Cadence Design Systems Inc to help them optimize the placement of those transistors.On Monday, Nvidia released a paper showing that it could use a combination of artificial intelligence techniques to find better ways to place big groups of transistors. The paper aimed to improve on a 2021 paper by Alphabet Inc's Google, whose findings later became the subject of controversy.The Nvidia research took an existing effort developed by University of Texas researchers using what is called reinforcement learning and added a second layer of artificial intelligence on top of it to get even better results.Nvidia chief scientist Bill Dally said the work is important because chip manufacturing improvements are slowing with per-transistor costs in new generations of chip manufacturing technology now higher than previous generations.That goes against the famous prediction by Intel Corp co-founder Gordon Moore that chips would always get cheaper and faster.""You're no longer actually getting an economy from that scaling,"" Dally said. ""To continue to move forward and to deliver more value to customers, we can't get it from cheaper transistors. We have to get it by being more clever on the design.""(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Sam Holmes)]"
247,16db6c38-0f09-3b68-b0ad-6f05fa2705aa,NVDA,2023-03-28,Should Investors Chase Nvidia or AMD Stock at Current Levels?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-chase-nvidia-amd-stock-235311154.html,1679961191,STORY,"['NVDA', 'AMD']","[The rally among many semiconductor stocks this year has provided a nice boost to the Nasdaq with the tech-heavy index up +12% year to date to outperform the broader S&amp;P 500’s +4%.Investors may be wondering if it’s still time to buy some of the popular names among semiconducor stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA).Let’s see if AMD or Nvidia stock offers good value to investors at their current levels.Performance Overview AMD and Nvidia have continued to increase their relevance in recent years as essential chip makers. To that point, AMD has begun to pass rival Intel (INTC) as a consumer PC chip provider and is also challenging Nvidia and its dominance in the graphic processing unit (GPU) market.Year to date, Nvidia stock has soared a stellar +81% Vs. AMD’s +49% with both outperforming the broader indexes. The rebound after last year’s drop for many stocks in the broader technology sector has been very impressive.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationAfter such extensive rallies this year, monitoring AMD and Nvidia’s valuation will be important for investors. Trading around $96 per share and only 2% from its 52-week high AMD has a forward P/E of 32.5X. In comparison, Nvidia stock is 8% off its highs at around $265 a share and trades at 59.7X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAMD trades 21% below its decade high of 41.6X but 36% above the median of 23.8X. When comparing this period, Nvidia looks more attractive as it trades 39% below its own decade high of 99.2X and closer to its median of 53.5X.Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for both chipmakers and they currently trade well above the S&amp;P 500’s 18.2X. With that being said, checking AMD and Nvidia's growth is very necessary in a high inflationary environment.Outlook AMD earnings are now expected to dip -14% in fiscal 2023 but rebound and climb 37% in FY24 at $4.14 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have declined for both FY23 and FY24 throughout the quarter.  Story continuesSales are forecasted to be virtually flat this year and jump 15% in FY24 to $27.18 billion. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to Nvidia, earnings are projected to jump 34% in FY23 at $4.48 per share compared to $3.34 a share in 2022. Even better, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to soar another 33% to $5.97 a share. Earnings estimates have gone up for FY23 over the last 90 days but are slightly down for FY24.On the top line, Nvidia’s sales are expected to be up 10% this year and jump another 25% in FY24 to $37.15 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line  The top and bottom line growth of Nvidia remains attractive at the moment with its stock landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as earnings estimate revisions are slightly up for fiscal 2023. In contrrast, the declining earnings estimates for AMD’s FY23 and FY24 lands the stock a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the moment.  There should certainly be better buying opportunities for both stocks throughout the year but holding on to shares of NVDA at current levels could still be rewarding considering its historical performance and valuation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds. The world of cryptocurrency is familiar with unpredictability. Previously, we reported that in May 2021, the value of Bitcoin dropped by 50% but eventually bounced back and reached record highs of around $69,000 later that year. According to predictions, Bitcoin was expected to end 2022 at roughly $16,800, which is a decline from its peak of $19,500 during the FTX crisis. If FTX's bankruptcy led to more controversies, Bitcoin's value was set to decrease even further. Even Cathie Wood, a well-known Bitcoin expert from ARK Invest, acknowledged that financial institutions may reassess their cryptocurrency strategies in the short term due to the FTX situation.The crypto industry's instability and uncertainty have not stopped it from challenging some significant financial norms, gradually pushing the world towards a contemporary economy. While recent global incidents, such as the FTX crisis and Bitcoin's drop, have affected the crypto industry, some retail traders worldwide think that purchasing cryptocurrency products during the dip could contribute to the sector's revival.Bitcoin has surged by approximately 70% this year, and experts in the industry who spoke with CNBC are optimistic, with one suggesting that the most significant cryptocurrency in the world could achieve new peaks. In November 2021, Bitcoin reached its highest ever value of $68,990.90, but it has since dropped by roughly 60%. According to Marshall Beard, the Chief Strategy Officer at Gemini, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, there is a chance that Bitcoin could reach $100,000. Beard explained that if Bitcoin were to return to its previous all-time high of approximately $69,000, it would not require much additional growth to reach the $100,000 mark. Similarly, Paolo Ardoino, who serves as the Chief Technology Officer at Tether, a stablecoin provider, expressed his belief that Bitcoin may ""retest"" its previous peak value of around $69,000.Story continuesThe cryptocurrency industry's current optimistic outlook on Bitcoin is partly due to how the asset has fared during the banking chaos that resulted from the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank and the insolvency of two cryptocurrency-friendly banks, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Amid this positive sector outlook, some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V). Our Methodology These are the most popular crypto stocks among the 943 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. These companies have deep links to the crypto universe. We have arranged the list according to the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. 11 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsPhoto by André François McKenzie on UnsplashBest Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds11. Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam and has grown to become one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. On February 21, Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) reported a Q4 GAAP loss per share of $2.46 and a revenue of $629.1 million, topping Wall Street estimates by $0.05 and $41.73 million, respectively.Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) has revealed that it has received a Wells notice from the SEC in regards to some parts of its spot market, Coinbase Earn staking service, Coinbase Prime institutional investor platform, and Coinbase Wallet. According to Compass Point analyst Chase White, this announcement is likely to be viewed as a significant risk by investors. He anticipates that Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) will contest any enforcement action in court, a process that could take years, including potential appeals. Despite the ongoing legal challenge, the analyst believes that the SEC's actions are not expected to pose an existential threat to Coinbase, and that the company will likely emerge victorious in court. The worst-case scenario, in his view, would be a substantial fine in the hundreds of millions of dollars. While acknowledging the potential negative impact of the ongoing legal battle, the firm continues to recommend a Buy rating on Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) shares, with a target price of $100 as of March 24.According to Insider Monkey's Q4 data, 27 hedge funds were bullish on Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN), comapred to 28 funds in the prior quarter.

Gray's Orbis Investment Management is the largest position holder in the company.LVS Advisory made the following comment about Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.

I published a detailed write-up (link here) and also appeared on the ‘Yet Another Value Podcast’ (link here) to discuss our IBKR thesis. To boil it down, IBKR benefits from higher interest rates, and the stock was available at an exceptionally cheap price. I believe IBKR represents a particularly good risk/reward bet and have made it our largest position.”9. CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) runs global markets where futures and options contracts are traded. They provide various futures and options products related to interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, energy, cryptocurrencies, and metals.

Recall that a significant portion of CME’s business benefits from higher interest rates and therefore the market’s increased expectation for federal funds rate cuts in 2023 has weighed on the stock.”8. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 62Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) released a new technology called Intel Blockscale in April 2022, which is designed to provide energy-efficient blockchain hashing. Several companies, including Argo Blockchain plc (NASDAQ:ARBK), Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:HIVE), and GRIID Infrastructure, were to be among the first customers to use the Intel Blockscale ASIC. The ASIC has a maximum power capacity of 580 GH/s hash rate. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the best cryptocurrency stocks to invest in. On March 20, Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri raised the firm's price target on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to $33 from $30 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst noted that the expectations for the PC segment in the near-term are not very high, but there are signs of recovery in the Commercial segment where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) holds a strong position.

D E Shaw is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 13.3 million shares worth $353.7 million. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“A third approach to return generation is purchasing idiosyncratic businesses that largely control their own destiny. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), which we purchased in the first quarter on the premise that it would develop a leading domestic foundry business, has struggled with execution missteps and product delays. We are maintaining the position to provide ongoing exposure to semiconductors.”7. Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Block, Inc.

(NYSE:SQ) also creates software for blockchain technology and crypto assets. The company's future plans will mainly center around CEO Jack Dorsey's enduring belief in the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

It is one of the premier cryptocurrency stocks to watch. On March 23, RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin maintained an Outperform rating and a $95 price target on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) shares. A recent report alleged that Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s ""underbanked"" user base consisted of unethical actors who artificially inflated the company's user metrics, and that its acquisition of Afterpay led to predatory pricing. RBC Capital believes that the negative impact of the report could persist for a while, but the firm's overall view of the stock has not changed.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 70 hedge funds were bullish on Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), compared to 75 funds in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Cummins' (NYSE:CMI) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Cummins is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.16 = US$3.0b ÷ (US$30b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Cummins has an ROCE of 16%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 11% generated by the Machinery industry. See our latest analysis for Cummins roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Cummins compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Cummins' ROCE Trending?While the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has employed 52% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 16%. 16% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Cummins has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.The Key TakeawayIn the end, Cummins has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 62% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesCummins does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Cummins  that you might be interested in.While Cummins may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest power generation companies in the world.Consistent generation and supply of power is absolutely integral to the development of any economy, and is one of the primary factors behind industrialization and the growth of Western economies. While just the 20 biggest power generation companies in the world earn annual revenues exceeding $2 trillion, their indirect contribution is even more significant as power supply is the backbone for the vast majority of industries across all sectors, across the world.Despite its importance, 2022 was not a very good year for the power and utility sector generally, but in the U.S., sales still continued to increase as demand jumped with the country mostly recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, even though revenues increased significantly because of the aforementioned demand, costs increased even more as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to energy supplies being depleted and prices more than doubling. Meanwhile, grid resilience is continuing to be tested from catastrophic climate events, one of the biggest global risks for 2023. To combat this issue, the biggest players in the industry, including some of the biggest power generation companies in the world, improved their reserves, deployed microgrids and worked on improving their infrastructure as well.25 biggest power generation companies in the worldPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashWhile these developments are likely to increase further in 2023 and even beyond, it is important to remember that as the Russian Ukraine war continues with no idea of when hostilities will cease, electricity prices are likely to stay high in 2023 while inflation and supply chain issues will add to the challenges that the industry is facing right now. Other issues such as extreme weather events and even cybersecurity will require innovation to ensure that power generation and its supply remains stable.Story continuesAs is true for most industries, the investment viability of the biggest power generation companies in the world doesn't just depend on revenue and profits but Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), which is continuing to gain momentum, especially with regards to decarbonization practices as companies try to identify societal and environmental disrupters while focus on resolving them. While such disclosures in the U.S. aren't uniform across power generation companies, this will also change in 2023, after a new SEC proposal in March 2022 regarding certain public disclosures.Another important consideration for the power generation industry is the requirement of a shift from using non-renewable resources to renewable resources. Companies creating clean energy have a lot of incentives, grants and subsidies from the government. This is why NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), the biggest renewables energy company by market cap, is also the biggest power generation company by market cap. According its Q4 2022 earnings call, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) CEO stated ""In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders."" This just helps signify the important of renewable energy production in this industry.The biggest power generation companies in the world are dominated by state-owned companies which earn significant amounts of revenue. To determine our list, we ranked them based on trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue and the latest market, both obtained from Yahoo Finance. We assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In case of private companies, we determined their revenue from Fortune Global 500, and ranked them based on revenue alone.

KeyCorp is down 30% year-to-date while M&amp;T is down 20%.However, Citi analysts said they felt both stocks were oversold.""MTB was the most disciplined with its excess cash during the period of low rates and has strongest capital position of the regionals,"" the analysts said in a note to clients on Monday. As for KeyCorp, the analysts noted that management ""made some mistakes, but they represent near-term headwinds and we found they have the largest benefit from repricing of fixed rate assets which will benefit 2024 and 2025 earnings.""Citi's new price target for KeyCorp is $20 a share, compared to a closing price of less than $12 on Friday. For MTB, it has cut its target price to $155 from $178, but that still represents 35% upside from Friday's close of just under $115.Analysts have argued that many banks have been slow to raise their deposit rates in line with official interest rates over the last year, leaving them vulnerable to deposit flight as their customers move their cash to higher yielding products such as money-market funds.That deposit flight accelerated exponentially as doubts over the viability of SVB and Signature started to emerge.However, the panic triggered by the collapse of SVB and Signature has abated in the last week as federal officials have backstopped the financial system with liquidity from the central bank and tough talk of support where necessary from the Treasury. Earlier on Monday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp announced it had reached a deal with First Citizens Bank to take over the deposits and most of the loans of SVB - albeit that rescue will leave a $20 billion dent in the U.S.'s deposit insurance fund.Story continuesRelated ArticlesKeyCorp, MTB rise on Citigroup upgrade to BuyU.S. brand management firm Bluestar Alliance buys Scotch &amp; Soda labelU.S. backstops Silicon Valley Bank sale to First Citizens]"

Credited for creating the modern-day Ulta (ULTA) as CEO for eight years, Dillon is wasting no time running a similar growth-minded playbook at Foot Locker.Earlier this month at an investor day, the company revealed its ""Lace Up"" plan. As part of the plan, Foot Locker will shutter 400 underperforming stores mostly in lower-tier malls and focus more on off-mall locations. The company will aim to better segment its various sneaker concepts, too.The Foot Locker brand will target sneaker-heads, while Champs Sports will target performance and athleisure shoppers.Over time, Foot Locker sees itself reaching $10 billion-plus in annual sales and a 10% operating margin. The company today is at about $8.5 billion in sales and a 7% operating margin.Dillon acknowledged that 2023 is a reset year as it works to clean up its store footprint and refine its operating model.""2023 is a reset year, we've been very clear about that. But we're investing in the capabilities that we need to really build the next 50 years of Foot Locker fame, I'll call it.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced a new State of the Internet report that focuses on the threats to businesses and consumers in Asia Pacific caused by malicious Domain Name System (DNS) traffic.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logoKey findings from the Asia Pacific (APAC) report include:QSnatch becomes largest APAC botnet threat: QSnatch - malware that specifically targets QNAP, a type of network attached storage (NAS) device used for backups or file storage by businesses – was by far the largest botnet threat in enterprise environments in APAC in 2022. Almost 60 percent of affected devices in APAC were infected with QSnatch, making this region second only to North America in terms of devices with QSnatch infections globally.Rise of enterprise command and control traffic: Between 10 percent and 16 percent of organizations globally encounter command and control (C2) traffic in their network in any given quarter, indicating the possibility of an attack or breach in progress. In APAC, Akamai observed about 15 percent of affected devices reaching out to Initial Access Brokers (IABs) domains. These are cyber-criminal gangs who sell unauthorized access to breached networks to other cyber criminals, such as ransomware groups.APAC suffers highest home network threats globally: APAC recorded far higher consumer home network threats than any other global region. This region has twice the number of malicious flagged queries in the second half of 2022 compared to North America – the region with the second flagged queries. More than 350 million queries in APAC were found to be related to Pykspa, an info-stealing worm that spreads through Skype by sending malicious links to the affected users' contacts.Story continuesBusinesses increasingly threatened by DNS attacks With most internet usage facilitated via DNS, it has become an important part of the attack infrastructure due to its ubiquity. Akamai observes nearly seven trillion DNS requests daily and classifies malicious DNS transactions into three main categories: malware, phishing and command and control.According to Akamai's data, between 10 percent and 16 percent of organizations globally encounter command and control (C2) traffic in their network in any given quarter. The presence of C2 traffic indicates the possibility of an attack in progress, or a breach, and threats range from information stealing botnets to Initial Access Brokers (IABs) who sell unauthorized access to breached networks to other cyber criminals.In APAC, 15 percent of affected devices have reached out to known IAB C2 domains – such as Emotet – who conduct the initial breach before selling access to ransomware groups like Lockbit and other cybercriminal groups. The region also saw ransomware variants like Revil and Lockbit move into the top five types of C2 threats affecting devices across all organizations.Network-attached storage devices are ripe for exploitation as they are less likely to be patched and they hold troves of valuable data. Akamai data shows almost 60 percent of affected devices in APAC were infected with Qsnatch - an infostealer malware targeting NAS devices - in 2022, making this region second only to North America in terms of number of infections. With a large concentration of data centers situated in APAC, as well as the popularity of NAS devices in the small and medium enterprises segment, these factors most likely increased the number of infections overall.""As Asia Pacific continues to accelerate its evolution as a global hub for economic and digital transformation, it is thus no surprise that attackers continue to explore any way to attack enterprises for financial gain. Akamai's latest findings not only highlight the most prevalent attacks in each region, but also that multi-stage attacks have become a staple of the modern cyber landscape in our region. Threat Actors are finding increased success when they work together or when they can combine various tools in a single attack. A C2 infrastructure is pivotal in the success of these attacks as they can be used for communication as well as to facilitate downloading a payload and the next-stage malware to move the attack onward,"" explained Reuben Koh, Director of Security Technology and Strategy, APJ at Akamai.""It is crucial that organizations stay ahead of bad actors because of the detrimental impact that multi-stage attacks can have on their businesses. More than the immediate impacts of direct financial loss, and loss of customer confidence and trust, there is also the long-term costs to recover compromised infrastructure, such as legal, reimbursement and clean-up costs,"" he continued.Homeowners to be on high alert for DNS Attacks While attackers often have their sights on enterprises because it presents a bigger payoff when they successfully breach their networks, home users are often an easier and quicker target as their networks are not as secure as a corporate environment. Attackers are seeking to abuse not only traditional devices like computers, but also mobile phones and Internet of Things devices.According to Akamai's data, APAC had the highest number of queries flagged in relation to the home network threats in the second half of 2022. The region had twice the number as compared to North America – the second most region with flagged queries.In APAC, more than 350 million queries related to Pykspa were observed, a threat that spreads through Skype by sending malicious links to the affected users' contacts. Its backdoor capabilities allow an attacker to connect to a remote system and execute arbitrary commands such as download files, terminate processes, and propagate through various means, including mapped drives and network shares.Phishing campaigns are also actively targeting financial brands in APAC to lure in unsuspecting consumer phishing victims. Akamai's research found that over 40% of all phishing campaigns were focused on financial services customers, resulting in close to 70% of all victims suffering from finance-related phishing scams and attacks. This clearly indicates that attacks against financial services and their customers were highly effective in 2022.""Beyond the personal consequences that home users face of potentially losing all their data when their networks are compromised, there are far more insidious consequences if their devices become part of a massive botnet with attackers mobilizing zombie devices to perform cybercriminal activities without the user's knowledge, like spamming and even launching DDoS attacks against organizations,"" said Reuben Koh, Director of Security Technology and Strategy, APJ at Akamai.""It is unsurprising that we are seeing the rise of such attacks in our region, with Asia Pacific accounting for over 1.2 billion people accessing mobile internet services today1, and with IoT spending forecasted to reach $436 billion in 20262. The continuing increase in mobile and smart device use and adoption in the region is likely to foreshadow the increase in such attacks, which requires home users to be on high alert to avoid falling victim to cyberattacks,"" he continued.Advice to business and home users Following analysis of the DNS landscape, Akamai shares the following guidance to business and home users:Remain proactive in ensuring optimal cyber hygiene practices for all your digital assets and users:Foster good security practices from home:About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

VZ recently introduced a 30-day free trial offer for unlimited data on its 5G network. The offer is applicable on any 5G compatible, unlocked eSIM-capable smartphone without disrupting the existing plan.The promotional offer, aimed primarily at non-Verizon customers, is likely to entice users who would prefer to enjoy the premium 5G network experience without any contractual obligations. The company expects that its super-fast network will likely attract and retain several new customers and augment its user base through lucrative mix-and-match unlimited plans. Verizon is offering various mix-and-match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans that have historically led to increased adoption of 5G devices and premium unlimited plans, translating into healthy customer additions.Last week, Verizon also announced the launch of BlueJeans Basic, a free virtual video conferencing plan for users that allows attendees to meet as long as they want. The new feature by Verizon subsidiary, BlueJeans, which offers an interoperable cloud-based video conferencing service across a wide range of devices and conferencing platforms, is aimed to facilitate a seamless transition to a hybrid workplace with a spontaneous and engaging interactive digital platform.BlueJeans Basic allows up to 25 persons to meet on a single platform equipped with HD video, spatial audio, industry-leading noise reduction and dynamic leveling for impeccable call quality. Leveraging AES 256-bit encryption, BlueJeans Basic also includes enterprise-grade security features like Waiting Room, Screen Sharing Controls and the option to Hard Mute participants individually or upon entering the meeting.Although such promotional offers and lucrative discounts are likely to expand its customer base, these are weighing on margins. In addition, the company’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive pressure from the voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data and video) offerings by cable companies. Verizon also recorded high capital expenditures for the launch and continued build-out of its 5G Ultra-Wideband network, deployment of significant fiber assets across the country and upgrade to Intelligent Edge Network architecture. It remains unclear if and when a reasonable return can be achieved from such investments.Nevertheless, with one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States, Verizon deploys the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies to deliver faster peak data speeds and capacity for customers, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and constant strategic investment. Its 5G mobility service offers an unparalleled experience that impacts industries as diverse as public safety, health care, retail and sports. The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology. These are massive spectrum holdings, particularly in the millimeter-wave bands for faster data transfer, end-to-end deep fiber resources and the ability to deploy a large number of small cells.The stock has lost 26.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 14.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksArista Networks, Inc.

The company's Astra EV Implant has been gaining momentum as well.XRAY launched Primeprint — a medical-grade, highly automated 3D printer — in 2022 to bolster dentists’ workflow and practice efficiency.

Moreover, the completion of internal investigation removes a major overhang for the company.What's Weighing on the Stock?DENTSPLY recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $1.1 billion net of tax during the third quarter. The charge reflected the impact of macroeconomic factors as a result of weakened global demand, higher cost of capital, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and increased raw material, supply chain and service costs.Macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign currency impacts, global supply chain challenges, and regional softness continued in China and the United States.

This move outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.17%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.67%.Heading into today, shares of the cable provider had lost 2.92% over the past month, lagging the Consumer Discretionary sector's loss of 2.74% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.25% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Comcast as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 27, 2023. On that day, Comcast is projected to report earnings of $0.83 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 3.49%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $29.92 billion, down 3.51% from the prior-year quarter.CMCSA's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.64 per share and revenue of $120.29 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of 0% and -0.94%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Comcast. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.77% lower within the past month. Comcast is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Comcast has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.88 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.75.Also, we should mention that CMCSA has a PEG ratio of 0.78.

Once complete, these locations will have the foundational next-generation network in place to introduce new multi-gigabit Internet options. Comcast is expanding fiber-rich network improvements that will offer Oregon and Washington customers upload speeds up to 10 times faster than the fastest they have now. And the network upgrade will extend throughout Comcast’s service area in Oregon and Washington to every community, zip code, and neighborhood served by the network.The first phase of network enhancements is happening now and initially will offer a maximum download speed of 2 Gbps, combined with upload speeds up to 200 Mbps, which is five to 10 times faster than Comcast’s existing upload speeds. Comcast expects that 40 percent of the company’s network in the Pacific Northwest will offer multi-gig Internet speeds by the end of 2023.Comcast will also expand its network to deliver Xfinity Internet and TV services and Comcast Business Internet services to nearly 60,000 additional homes and businesses, including the rural communities of Eagle Creek, Estacada, Mt. Angel, and Silverton in Oregon, and Battleground, Chattaroy, Key Peninsula and Sumas in Washington.The network expansion is the latest example of Comcast’s investment to connect more households and businesses in the Pacific Northwest to its Internet services that deliver fast speeds, more reliability, broader coverage in the home, and greater capacity to support customers’ growing Internet usage. Comcast expanded service to 54,788 additional homes and businesses last year in Oregon and Washington. Further, the company has invested $1B in technology and infrastructure investments in Oregon and Washington during the previous three years, including network expansion and upgrades.Story continuesCommunity InvestmentThe $280 million investment by Comcast this year will fund contributions, foundation grants, free Internet connectivity, employee volunteerism and giving campaigns, broadcast services, laptop donations, and more to make a positive impact in communities throughout Oregon and Washington. Throughout the year, the company will collaborate with non-profit partners, including Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Goodwill, Urban League, YWCA, and others to advance digital equity and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Pacific Northwest.The funding will also support ongoing efforts to build awareness about connectivity programs like Internet Essentials and the federal government’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which offers eligible households up to $30/month credit, or up to $75 for households on tribal lands, for home Internet. Comcast proudly participates in the Affordable Connectivity Program and offers Internet Essentials Plus, a $29.95/month home Internet service that is effectively free for eligible households, once the ACP credit is applied. Interested customers can visit Xfinity.com/ACP or call 1-800-Xfinity to learn more about this program and determine if they qualify.“The Washington State Broadband Office is pleased that Comcast is expanding its service to numerous locations in Washington that have previously been without needed broadband service. Not only is Comcast providing expanded access, but they are also partnering with non-profits to provide training and devices that assist people in using broadband services. The company’s investments and collaboration with community partners are essential to ensuring that broadband service is a reality for residents and businesses in Washington.”“Our investment is helping to build a network of the future and get more rural communities in Oregon and Washington connected to the Internet,” said Rodrigo Lopez, Senior Regional Vice President of Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. “In addition to delivering the network of tomorrow and more broadband in more places, we are also investing to advance digital equity and help build a future of unlimited possibilities in the Pacific Northwest.”For more information on Comcast in Oregon, visit https://oregon.comcast.com/.

279,b7a9df49-82e2-37df-8a2a-8376099b9e1f,DVN,2023-03-28,Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/declining-stock-solid-fundamentals-market-120025847.html,1680004825,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) has had a rough three months with its share price down 24%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Devon Energy's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Devon Energy is:53% = US$6.0b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.53.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Devon Energy's Earnings Growth And 53% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Devon Energy has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 30% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Devon Energy's exceptional 54% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Devon Energy's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 16% in the same period, which is great to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is DVN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Devon Energy Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Devon Energy's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 46%, meaning the company retains 54% of its income. So it seems that Devon Energy is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered.Additionally, Devon Energy has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that Devon Energy's future ROE will drop to 22% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE.SummaryOverall, we are quite pleased with Devon Energy's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

280,8018cd1a-8ac8-3c86-ba2d-44e966911b69,DVN,2023-03-28,Devon Energy Corporation (DVN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/devon-energy-corporation-dvn-trending-130001759.html,1679922001,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy (DVN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned -15.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.3% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has lost 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -17.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.98 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -16%. This estimate has changed -6.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.13 indicates a change of +2.1% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Devon Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $17.47 billion and $17.21 billion estimates indicate -8.9% and -1.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $4.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.66 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.5%. The EPS surprise was -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

281,4704f2a8-20f9-324f-a09d-8e6551c692d5,URI,2023-03-28,"United Rentals (URI) May Find a Bottom Soon, Here's Why You Should Buy the Stock Now",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-uri-may-bottom-135501303.html,1679925301,STORY,['URI'],"[The price trend for United Rentals (URI) has been bearish lately and the stock has lost 13.6% over the past two weeks. However, the formation of a hammer chart pattern in its last trading session indicates that the stock could witness a trend reversal soon, as bulls might have gained significant control over the price to help it find support.The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this equipment rental company enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.1-month candlestick chart for URIWhat is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Story continuesLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for URIAn upward trend in earnings estimate revisions that URI has been witnessing lately can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 0.5%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering URI are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that URI currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator, helping investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve. So, for the shares of United Rentals, a Zacks Rank of 1 is a more conclusive fundamental indication of a potential turnaround.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Increasing demand for generic drugs and biosimilars is driving growth for scientific tool and apparatus providers. Pharma companies are focused on rapidly growing areas like proteomics and phenomics, biopharma and applied, microbiology and diagnostics, and neuroscience and cell microscopy. This creates significant demand for the instruments provided by industry participants.Aging Demography Driving Spending: Socioeconomic factors like aging demography and increasing environmental regulations are fueling the demand for scientific measurement solutions. Robust worldwide healthcare spending is another major growth driver.Emerging Market Prospects Solid: The industry is gaining from increasing exposure to developing economies like China and India. Prospects in China are huge as regulators attempt to raise the country’s biopharma industry to global standards. Efforts to improve the country’s drug development process and production quality are noteworthy. These factors result in strong demand for instruments.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dim ProspectsThe Zacks Instruments - Scientific industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #172, which places it at the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dim near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, analysts are pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Mar 31, 2022, the industry’s 2023 earnings estimates have moved down 9.3%.Despite having a gloomy near-term outlook, there are few stocks in the industry worth watching.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&amp;P 500.Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.Story continuesThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers. Moreover, these companies also pay out dividends regularly to shareholders, which helps them stay afloat during market downturns. Some companies with solid financials are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which is evident through their decades-long dividend growth histories. In this article, we will discuss the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy.12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Nowmaxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries. These companies are strong dividend payers and have decent yields. We sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data as of Q4 2022.12. Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based diversified manufacturing company that designs various products that belong to the home and automobile industries. On February 23, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend.

As of March 27, the stock has a dividend yield of 5.70%.Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) holds a strong dividend growth track record like other dividend stocks such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc.

The collective value of these stakes is over $25 million. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.11. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is an American sportswear and footwear retailer which has operations in over 28 countries. Evercore ISI upgraded the stock to Outperform in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $60. The firm appreciated the company's strong business model.Foot Locker, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”10.

If you want to read about some more companies in the stock portfolio of Kevin O’Leary, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2023.Kevin O’Leary, one of the most well-known finance personalities on television, has made a number of significant stock investments over the years. As the Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, O'Leary contends that stocks in your portfolio should be high-quality businesses with sound balance sheets and great financial performance. Secondly, he believes that a portfolio should be diversified so as to include a variety of market sectors. The last factor, and perhaps the most important, is the need for dividend payments by the firms he is considering investing in.With that being said, the economic crisis heightened by the coronavirus contagion during the last two years and the spillover effects of it across the globe has led to financial markets being more volatile in 2023 compared to pre-pandemic years. Obviously rising interest rates contribute to this as well. Because it is unclear how the economy will respond to increasing interest rates, stocks are falling. However, O’Leary, in an interview with CNBC, said he firmly believes in retaining stocks during a time of rising interest rates.“Even as rates go up, equities are the place to be because fixed income gets hurt a lot more,” he said. This is greatly evident in the kinds of stocks he invests in. According to the investment mogul, businesses that have control over their prices provide good investment opportunities. In light of the current situation, O'Leary seeks out businesses that may raise prices without facing too much opposition from consumers.“Where you want to be in equities, particularly when rates start taking up, is in companies that have pricing power,” O’Leary added. “In other words, their goods and services are necessities for people, so they are willing to take a small increase in price, sometimes a larger one, as rates go up.” The companies that satisfy this criterion are the ones that belong to the healthcare sector. Story continues“Right now, healthcare looks really good and also consumer cyclicals look very good,” he said. O’Leary further suggests that in times of inflation, investors should focus on businesses that provide goods and services that people still need, particularly ""what they eat"" and ""what they drive.""Another area in which O’Leary thinks people can retain stocks is the energy sector. During the ongoing period of high inflation, the costs of fueling your car, and heating your office or home have become all the pricier. Subsequently, for the past couple of years energy stocks have generated above-average gains. Therefore, the energy sector, O’Leary maintains, is a stable market to invest your stocks in, despite the recent drop in oil prices. Our MethodologyHere is a quick look at Kevin O’Leary’s top 10 picks for stock investments in 2023 that describe not only his philosophy but also provides valuable information on asset management. O’Leary often typically invests in equities of large, successful companies with solid balance sheets and yearly dividend increases that are consistent. The holdings listed below were picked from the ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF Shares (BATS:OUSA). Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2023Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.comKevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: Stock Picks for 202310.

With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Seagate Technology Holdings. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Seagate Technology Holdings?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Seagate Technology Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Seagate Technology Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 6.5% of Seagate Technology Holdings shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.5% and 6.3% of the stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Seagate Technology HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Seagate Technology Holdings plc. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$65m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Seagate Technology Holdings. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   5 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings (2 shouldn't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

302,9e2b1850-eadb-3ebb-9491-21a6421cbb92,RHI,2023-03-28,Is There Now An Opportunity In Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-robert-half-international-164656932.html,1679935616,STORY,['RHI'],"[Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE:RHI), is not the largest company out there, but it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$88.71 and falling to the lows of US$71.73. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Robert Half International's current trading price of US$74.70 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Robert Half International’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Robert Half International What Is Robert Half International Worth?Good news, investors! Robert Half International is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 12.03x is currently well-below the industry average of 22.76x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Robert Half International’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Robert Half International?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Robert Half International, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.9%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since RHI is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on RHI for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy RHI. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.In light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PCAR has an improving earnings outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.88, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 22. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.09. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.97.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.77. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 4.45.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of A and FOXF's Value grade of C.Story continuesPCAR stands above FOXF thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

304,b269f233-9608-3521-96d2-4d9871eeb555,PCAR,2023-03-28,Are Investors Undervaluing PACCAR (PCAR) Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-paccar-pcar-now-134001903.html,1679924401,STORY,['PCAR'],"[Here at Zacks, our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks. Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.66. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 30.11. PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.22 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.71, all within the past year.Investors will also notice that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.17. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.23. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.17.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 2.77. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.21. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.02 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.53.Story continuesValue investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.27. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.53.Finally, our model also underscores that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.62. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 17.94. PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.45 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 10.20, all within the past year.These are only a few of the key metrics included in PACCAR's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

305,d244d341-faad-37c8-ac89-05a179e73b0a,TROW,2023-03-28,Kevin O’Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kevin-o-leary-stock-portfolio-134450656.html,1679924690,STORY,"['MMC', 'TROW', 'AAPL', 'PFE', 'MCD']","[In this article, we discuss the 10 companies to consider in the portfolio of Kevin O’Leary. If you want to read about some more companies in the stock portfolio of Kevin O’Leary, go directly to Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 5 Stock Picks for 2023.Kevin O’Leary, one of the most well-known finance personalities on television, has made a number of significant stock investments over the years. As the Chairman of O’Shares Investment Advisors, O'Leary contends that stocks in your portfolio should be high-quality businesses with sound balance sheets and great financial performance. Secondly, he believes that a portfolio should be diversified so as to include a variety of market sectors. The last factor, and perhaps the most important, is the need for dividend payments by the firms he is considering investing in.With that being said, the economic crisis heightened by the coronavirus contagion during the last two years and the spillover effects of it across the globe has led to financial markets being more volatile in 2023 compared to pre-pandemic years. Obviously rising interest rates contribute to this as well. Because it is unclear how the economy will respond to increasing interest rates, stocks are falling. However, O’Leary, in an interview with CNBC, said he firmly believes in retaining stocks during a time of rising interest rates.“Even as rates go up, equities are the place to be because fixed income gets hurt a lot more,” he said. This is greatly evident in the kinds of stocks he invests in. According to the investment mogul, businesses that have control over their prices provide good investment opportunities. In light of the current situation, O'Leary seeks out businesses that may raise prices without facing too much opposition from consumers.“Where you want to be in equities, particularly when rates start taking up, is in companies that have pricing power,” O’Leary added. “In other words, their goods and services are necessities for people, so they are willing to take a small increase in price, sometimes a larger one, as rates go up.” The companies that satisfy this criterion are the ones that belong to the healthcare sector. Story continues“Right now, healthcare looks really good and also consumer cyclicals look very good,” he said. O’Leary further suggests that in times of inflation, investors should focus on businesses that provide goods and services that people still need, particularly ""what they eat"" and ""what they drive.""Another area in which O’Leary thinks people can retain stocks is the energy sector. During the ongoing period of high inflation, the costs of fueling your car, and heating your office or home have become all the pricier. Subsequently, for the past couple of years energy stocks have generated above-average gains. Therefore, the energy sector, O’Leary maintains, is a stable market to invest your stocks in, despite the recent drop in oil prices. Our MethodologyHere is a quick look at Kevin O’Leary’s top 10 picks for stock investments in 2023 that describe not only his philosophy but also provides valuable information on asset management. O’Leary often typically invests in equities of large, successful companies with solid balance sheets and yearly dividend increases that are consistent. The holdings listed below were picked from the ALPS O'Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF Shares (BATS:OUSA). Kevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: 10 Stock Picks for 2023Helga Esteb/Shutterstock.comKevin O'Leary’s Stock Portfolio: Stock Picks for 202310. McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is a fairly resilient business. Its large global footprint, extensive restaurant network, well-reputed brand image, and real estate holdings provide it a competitive advantage. In fact, the company's success has been demonstrated by its superior track record compared to a wide range of rivals.With approximately 40,000 stores across more than 100 countries, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is the top global retailer of food service. Around 93% of the stores are independently owned and run. The business is considered a Dividend Aristocrat since it has increased its dividend every year since it paid its first dividend in 1976.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) released its full-year 2022 results and Q4 2022 results on January 31st, 2023. A 5% increase in system-wide sales was offset by currency headwinds to result in total revenue for the quarter of $5,926.5 million, a (1%) decline from $6,009.1 million compared to Q4 2021. In contrast to restaurants with franchises, company-owned stores had a decline in revenue (13%). In comparison to comparable periods, operating costs were lower, resulting in a 19% increase in earnings to $2.59 per share.Geographically, revenues rose by 10.3% in the US, 12.6% internationally, and 16.5% internationally in markets with developmental licenses. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, growth was robust in the UK, France, Germany, Japan, and Brazil and weak in China. Diluted GAAP earnings per share fell to $8.33 for the entire year, and revenue decreased to $23.18 billion.Because of its value proposition, McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is doing better than many of its competitors during a period of rising inflation. COVID-19 in China, the conflict in Ukraine, and inflation are obstacles, nevertheless. It is due to such reasons that Kevin O’Leary has made investments in the company. 9. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW)One of the biggest publicly traded asset managers is T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW), which was established in 1937 and has its headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. For individual and institutional investors, retirement plans, and financial intermediaries, the organization offers a wide selection of mutual funds, sub-advisory services, and separate account administration. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW) released its fourth quarter and annual results for the period ending December 31, 2022, on January 26th, 2023. Revenue decreased by 22.4% to $1.52 billion for the quarter, $10 million less than analysts had predicted. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.74 was $0.03 more than expectations while being down from $3.17 in the previous year. Revenue decreased by 15.4% to $6.5 billion for the year, while adjusted earnings-per-share decreased to $8.02 from $12.75 in 2021.Assets under management (AUM) fell 12.6% for the quarter to $1.27 trillion. Net client outflows of $17.1 billion, net payouts of $2.5 billion not reinvested, client transfers of $2.1 billion, and market depreciation were the causes of this decline. Operational costs reached $1.3 billion, up 15.6% annually and 25.4% sequentially.For many years, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NADAQ:TROW) has been a fantastic company with excellent operating metrics. The company's performance throughout the quarter was once again impacted by market volatility. However, the sector as a whole continues to be hampered by the emphasis on lower fees. 8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the pioneers of revolutionizing the way technology operates ever since it launched the Macintosh in 1984. The tech corporation currently creates, produces, and markets goods like iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs. Apple also operates a services division that offers subscriptions, apps, and music.The company released its Q1 fiscal year 2023 results on February 2, 2023, covering the period ending December 31, 2022 (Apple's fiscal year concludes on the last Saturday in September). Apple's revenue for the period was $117.154 billion, a 5.5% decrease as compared to Q1 2022.The metrics indicate that product sales decreased by 7.7%, with an 8.2% drop in iPhone sales accounting for 56% of all sales. Services accounted for 17.7% of total revenues in the quarter, up 6.4% to $20.8 billion. Compared to $34.630 billion or $2.10 per share in Q1 2022, net income was $29.998 billion, or $1.88 per share.7. Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)One of the biggest global pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) focuses on immunizations and prescription medications. Among the most-selling drugs produced by the company are Eliquis, Ibrance, Prevnar, Enebrel (international), Sutent, Xtandi, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Inlyta, Xeljanz, Plaxlovid, and Comiranty. Pfizer released its fourth-quarter results on January 31, 2023, along with its full-year results. On a yearly basis, overall revenue increased by 2% to $24,290M from $23,838M, and adjusted diluted profits per share increased by 45% to $1.14 from $0.79. In comparison quarters, diluted GAAP earnings per share increased by 48% to $0.87 from $0.59.Because of considerable R&amp;D and acquisitions, Pfizer's present product range is anticipated to deliver top line and bottom-line growth through 2028. Inlyta (renal cell cancer), Prevnar family (pneumococcal vaccine), Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine), Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (transthyretin stabilizers), Eliquis (cardiovascular), Ibrance (oncology), Xtandi (oncology), Hospital Products, and Biosimilars are all reporting strong sales growth. Paxlovid, a recently released antiviral, is expanding quickly.Increased sales for approved indications, extensions, R&amp;D, and bolt-on acquisitions will all contribute to future growth. Revenue from COVID will decrease in 2023. However, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) wisely boosted its pipeline by increasing R&amp;D and acquisitions. This high-quality stock may appeal to investors, and the business is rich with cash.6. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC)A multinational holding firm for professional services, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) is involved in risk, strategy, and human resources. Marsh (insurance broker and risk management), Guy Carpenter (reinsurance and capital strategies), Mercer (human resources and consulting), and Oliver Wyman are the company's four primary global operations (strategy, economic, and brand consulting).Almost 130 nations have customers for the company, and there are 86,000 employees worldwide.

307,bc68d15d-8dd5-31bc-9809-b644e48925ae,UPS,2023-03-28,Push in states for $20 minimum wage as inflation persists,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/push-states-20-minimum-wage-111018605.html,1680001818,STORY,['UPS'],"[ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Just years after labor activists persuaded a handful of states to raise their minimum wage to $15 per hour, workers initially thrilled with the pay bump are finding their hard-won gains erased by inflation.New York City resident Anthony Rivera, 20, who sorts packages at a United Parcel Service facility in Brooklyn, said he had to take a second job at a grocery store after his food costs soared.“I was sitting at $15 an hour at UPS, and when it came to paying bills and buying groceries, it was starting to become not enough,” he said. “That led me to no other option than to pick up another job.”New York, California and Massachusetts are among states where pro-labor forces are now pushing proposals that, if approved, would boost minimum wages to $20 or more in the coming years.Inflation has meant that something that cost $15 in 2012 — when labor activists adopted the “Fight for $15” slogan in a push for wage hikes — would probably cost almost $20 today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.But opponents to the wage hikes say they can be detrimental to small businesses, which already took a major hit during the coronavirus pandemic.Cindy Lee, the owner of a bowling alley in Endicott, New York, said she's struggling to pay off loans taken out during the pandemic that kept her business afloat.“All this cost all at once is just going to kill us. I definitely will have to cut corners somewhere with employees if wages are raised,” said Lee, adding that she'd also have to increase prices on bowling, food and liquor.The federal minimum wage in the United States has stayed at $7.25 per hour since 2009, but states and some localities are free to set higher amounts. Thirty states have chosen to do so.Over the past decade, labor groups held out $15 as the target that would let low-paid workers sustain themselves within the 40-hour workweek. A growing number of states across the political spectrum have passed legislation that will take their minimum wage above that amount in the next few years, including Florida, Nebraska and Illinois. Eleven states have phased in wage increases of $5 or more within the past decade.Story continuesYet those gains were almost immediately tempered. Inflation in the United States hit a new 40-year high last summer after prices for basic necessities like gas and food soared. Supply chain issues resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, combined with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have disrupted gas and food supplies, sending those prices skyward.Labor activists are pressing for a new round of wage increases even as the old ones are still being phased in.A bill in New York would raise the state’s minimum wage to $21.25 by 2026, and then adjust it each year going forward for inflation. Right now, minimum wage workers in New York City get paid $15, while the rest of the state is at $14.20.In Massachusetts, one bill proposes to raise the wage every year until it hits $20 in 2027, up from $15 now.And in California, where the minimum wage is currently $15.50 for all workers, legislation signed in September would have set the state on a path to raise wages for fast-food workers to $22 per hour. The law was met with heavy opposition from restaurant industry groups who led a successful effort to force it into a referendum vote in 2024.Backers of a proposed wage increase in New York say they hope it will pass as part of the state budget, which is expected to be finalized in early April.“You can't tell us that after the pandemic, that $15 is going to still be enough for us to keep food on our tables,” said state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens, said at a rally in Albany. “That's why we want $21.25, nothing less. The price of everything is going up except for wages.”In her executive budget proposal, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, proposed tying minimum wage increases to inflation, but with a cap on how much wages could rise in any one year.Barry Nicholson, the owner of four retail businesses in Corning, a city by the Finger Lakes in New York, said a wage increase to $21.25 would be “a smack in the face to small businesses.”“There is just no way I could handle that,"" said Nicholson, who owns two UPS stores, and women's accessories and modern home furnishings stores. “When you look at retail hospitality, we live and die by a couple of points at the end of the day. We’re not the big corporations everyone talks about.”___Maysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now.Over the past two decades, industrial players have chased after value creation by focusing on product margin optimization, channel sales excellence, and programmatic M&amp;A. While these strategies proved fruitful in the pre-pandemic era, the disruptive forces of COVID-19, intensified by recent geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine, have ushered in a new world. While the industrials sector has experienced a decent rebound from a painful pandemic-driven recession, it also emerged to find a chaotic environment characterized by dramatic shifts in consumer purchasing behaviors, labor shortages, and global supply chain networks.In the past year, the industrials sector was largely driven by the same concerns as the broader market. High inflation—and the implications of high inflation for interest-rate policy—weighed heavily on stocks. The sector largely tracked the broad market's performance for much of the year, though after a bounce in the fourth quarter was on track to outperform the S&amp;P 500 for the year. The industrials sector may continue to be impacted in 2023 by many of the same near-term worries as other sectors—including, most pressingly, the increased risk of US or global recession. However, for investors with a long-term view, three key trends in the sector have created opportunities for US-based industrial companies: digital technologies and processes, an increased focus on sustainability, and a revival of domestic production instead of globe-spanning supply chains.Additionally, a recent survey by McKinsey states that executives at several industrial companies have identified three crucial priorities that have emerged during these past few years: rising costs and inflationary pressures, talent retention and skill gaps among workers, and supply chain disruptions. While many companies are still focused on post-pandemic top-line recovery alongside combating short-term disruptions to maintain operating margins, leading firms are doubling down on long-term structural changes to how they approach customer interactions, supply chain resilience, and talent retention. While a US or global recession, should one occur, could slow the progress of these changes, it would be unlikely to derail them completely.Story continuesIndustrial stocks include some of the oldest public companies that seem to form the backbone of the U.S. economy while lending their name to one of the key U.S. stock market indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months.

In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 940 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Most Profitable Industrial Stocks Now13. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), commonly known as simply UPS, is an American multinational shipping &amp; receiving and supply chain management company founded in 1907. Originally known as the American Messenger Company specializing in telegraphs, UPS has grown to become a Fortune 500 company and one of the world's largest shipping couriers.At the beginning of February, MO Capital analyst Fadi Chamoun raised the price target on United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) to $185 from $175 but maintained a Market Perform rating on the shares after its Q4 earnings beat. The analyst seems ""encouraged"" by the company's steady execution and productivity improvements that laid the foundation for a strong performance once demand recovers. However, he warns against headwinds into the first half of 2023.On January 31, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) raised its quarterly dividend to $1.62 per share, thus growing  its dividend growth streak to 13 years.As of the close of Q4 2022, 36 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned investments in United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS), worth over $514.6 million. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is a notable shareholder in the company, with a stake worth approximately $128.76 million.Much like TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) has been raking in profits for its investors.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned UPS in Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) is the world’s largest package deliverer, operating globally. The company and its share price had benefited from pandemic-related spikes in shipping demand while supply was constrained (grounding of airlines and their associated space), leading to increased pricing power. Our view is such conditions will not persist as the environment normalizes. In Q3, UPS reported weak results and a decline in volume in its US domestic business, pressuring the share price.”12. Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is an American publicly traded, multinational conglomerate corporation that primarily operates in four areas of business: aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions. For fiscal Q4 2022, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) reported earnings-per-share of $2.52, beating estimates by $0.01. The company’s revenue for the quarter amounted to $9.11 billion.On February 3, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa raised the price target on Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) to $215 from $205 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. According to Tusa, the company's Q4 results and 2023 guidance were largely in line with expectations, and he sees an upside to the future outlook.Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) was spotted on 44 investors’ portfolios at the end of Q4 2022. The total stakes of these hedge funds amounted to $679.62 million. As of December 31, Diamond Hill Capital is the leading investor in the company and has disclosed a position worth $245.4 million.11. FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), formerly Federal Express Corporation and later FDX Corporation, is an American multinational conglomerate holding company focused on transportation, e-commerce and business services. On February 17, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share, in-line with its previous dividend. The company maintains a 21-year streak of consistent dividend growth.BofA analyst Ken Hoexter upgraded FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $233, up from $204. The analyst seems more confident in FedEx's outlook as it reduces excess capacity and enhances productivity. Additionally, he thinks that the headcount reductions could be a roughly $0.4 tailwind to quarterly EPS, while also stating that the company's aspirational targets are moving closer to reality.At the end of December 2022, 48 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), down from 57 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.48 billion. Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen were some of the company’s leading stakeholders in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Earnings results at FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX), a global shipping and logistics firm, disappointed due to slowing volumes—principally in its Express segment, which resulted in negative operating leverage—in addition to continued cost pressures. The Express business has been affected by trade disruptions in Asia from China’s COVID lockdowns, as well as the mix of global consumer spending trending back toward services and away from goods—a normalization of pandemic-driven consumer behavior. A key question for investors is how much of this demand slowdown is idiosyncratic and therefore less likely to repeat and how much is the start of a possible cyclical slowdown. To counter these headwinds, FedEx is looking to achieve cost reductions while it continues to implement multi-year structural cost reduction initiatives focused on technology investments and efficiency gains. Given a mixed track record and the recent earnings miss, there is a high degree of skepticism embedded in the current stock price as it sells for less than 8X our estimate of normalized earnings. While operating results can be choppy, the longer term business economics are highly favorable given the global shipping industry’s consolidated structure and massive barriers to entry that afford operators with pricing power to counter cost inflation and earn respectable returns on capital over the business cycle.”10. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is an American multinational aerospace and defense technology company. With 90,000 employees and an annual revenue in excess of $30 billion, it is one of the world's largest weapons manufacturers and military technology providers. The company stated that it is expecting solid margins and free cash-flow growth in 2023. Additionally, it expects to return at least 100% of adjusted free cash-flow to shareholders this year.At the end of January, Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers raised his price target on Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) to $470 from $460 and maintained an Equal Weight rating on the shares. Although the company's initial guide reset expectations with margins below on macro factors and CAS headwinds, the analyst points out that Northrop Grumman appears committed to an aggressive share repurchase, potentially limiting downside for the stock.There were 49 hedge funds long Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in the fourth quarter of 2022, and their total stake value in the company was $1.53 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the largest stakeholder in the company in the fourth quarter, holding stakes worth $428.26 million in the company.LRT Capital Management, an investment management firm, mentioned Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is one of the world’s largest defense contractors with annual revenue more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation the US defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company (BA), General Dynamics Corporation (GD), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTX).Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximate 15x, next year’s earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics’ division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and so on…” (Click here to read the full text)9. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) is an American manufacturing company that specializes in the production of construction equipment that also operates as the world's leading manufacturer of mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives.On February 7, BMO Capital analyst Joel Tiss raised the price target on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) to $230 from $210 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares of the manufacturing company. The analyst cites Caterpillar's ""strong"" underlying results in Q4 and believes that low inventory levels at its dealers, greater operating efficiencies, and share repurchases should help support earnings over the next few years.Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.99%, as of February 22. The company holds a 28-year streak of consistent dividend growth.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) grew to 50 in Q4 2022, from 43 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $5 billion. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the company's leading shareholder for the quarter.Diamond Hill Capital mentioned Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“In the case of Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), the company reported a better-than-expected Q3 as demand in mining, non-residential construction and energy remained healthy through the year even as recession fears grew. Caterpillar showed strong pricing power and operating efficiency in the face of supply chain constraints and labor shortages, which in turn contributed to better-than-expected share price performance.”8. Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is an American multinational aerospace and defense conglomerate headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. Not only does it rank as one of the largest aerospace and defense manufacturers in the world by revenue and market capitalization, the company is also one of the largest providers of intelligence services, as well as a large military contractor, getting a significant portion of its revenue from the U.S. government.Earlier this January, RBC Capital analyst Ken Herbert raised the price target on Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to $110 from $107 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares after its Q4 earnings beat. The analyst was ""not surprised"" by the relief rally in the stock following these results and remains positive on the defense conglomerate on account of its aerospace business growth and the expected acceleration in its defense sales.Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) remained a popular buy among hedge funds in Q4 2022, as 51 funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in the company, valued at approximately $1.82 billion. Dmitry Balyasny's Balyasny Asset Management was the company's biggest shareholder, with 2.27 million stakes worth $229.9 million.Carillon Tower Advisers mentioned Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) announced strong results led by strength in its commercial segment, but weakness in its defense business led to investor consternation. Management guided to a recovery in this segment, citing both transitory supply chain issues and continued strong demand.”7. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 523M Company (NYSE:MMM), formerly known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company,  is a multinational conglomerate corporation with operations in a wide range of industries, including healthcare, transportation, consumer products, and industrial markets. On February 7, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) declared a quarterly dividend rate of $1.50, a $0.01 increase from the previous rate.Earlier this December, Citi analyst Andrew Kaplowitz raised the price target on 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) to $126 from $117 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. According to the analyst, megatrends and ""still emerging fiscal tailwinds"" should help moderate potential downside for industrials in a slowing macro-economic environment in addition to improving price versus cost trends and gradually improving supply chains.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) was part of 52 public stock portfolios at the end of December 2022, compared to 49 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 2.46 million shares worth $295.95 million.Mayar Capital mentioned 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.6. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53The Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), formed by the merger of Lockheed Corporation with Martin Marietta in March 1995, is an American aerospace, arms, defense, information security, and technology corporation with worldwide interests. This past year, Lockheed Martin's Rotary &amp; Mission Systems segment amounted to about $16.15 billion while the company's product segment with the highest net sales of nearly $27 billion was Aeronautics.On February 6, Credit Suisse analyst Scott Deuschle upgraded Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to Outperform from Underperform with a price target of $510, up from $427, based on the firm's updated sector outlook, improved confidence in the company's growth inflection and alignment in the firm's out-year EBIT growth forecasts between Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC). According to the analyst, the company has now reported three consecutive quarters with a book-bill ratio greater than 1.0.At the end of Q4 2022, 53 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database owned stakes in Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), the same as the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is nearly $2.13 billion.

The war in Ukraine has reminded investors and the wider public just how important these companies are. The aerospace and defence industry in the USA is an established oligopoly. This means that a few large firms play a dominant role. While collectively they comprise an oligopoly, individually they often have monopoly positions in particular narrower segments. Their main counterparty is the US government, a key customer in what is known as a monopsonist position. This is a rather unusual situation, but one that is very advantageous for companies such as LMT.

Previously, we reported that in May 2021, the value of Bitcoin dropped by 50% but eventually bounced back and reached record highs of around $69,000 later that year. According to predictions, Bitcoin was expected to end 2022 at roughly $16,800, which is a decline from its peak of $19,500 during the FTX crisis. If FTX's bankruptcy led to more controversies, Bitcoin's value was set to decrease even further. Even Cathie Wood, a well-known Bitcoin expert from ARK Invest, acknowledged that financial institutions may reassess their cryptocurrency strategies in the short term due to the FTX situation.The crypto industry's instability and uncertainty have not stopped it from challenging some significant financial norms, gradually pushing the world towards a contemporary economy. While recent global incidents, such as the FTX crisis and Bitcoin's drop, have affected the crypto industry, some retail traders worldwide think that purchasing cryptocurrency products during the dip could contribute to the sector's revival.Bitcoin has surged by approximately 70% this year, and experts in the industry who spoke with CNBC are optimistic, with one suggesting that the most significant cryptocurrency in the world could achieve new peaks. In November 2021, Bitcoin reached its highest ever value of $68,990.90, but it has since dropped by roughly 60%. According to Marshall Beard, the Chief Strategy Officer at Gemini, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, there is a chance that Bitcoin could reach $100,000. Beard explained that if Bitcoin were to return to its previous all-time high of approximately $69,000, it would not require much additional growth to reach the $100,000 mark. Similarly, Paolo Ardoino, who serves as the Chief Technology Officer at Tether, a stablecoin provider, expressed his belief that Bitcoin may ""retest"" its previous peak value of around $69,000.Story continuesThe cryptocurrency industry's current optimistic outlook on Bitcoin is partly due to how the asset has fared during the banking chaos that resulted from the downfall of Silicon Valley Bank and the insolvency of two cryptocurrency-friendly banks, Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank. Amid this positive sector outlook, some of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy include Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Visa Inc.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Shell plc SHEL, BP plc BP and TechnipFMC FTI.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:UK Oil &amp; Gas Workers Demand Transition to Renewable Energy JobsIn recent years, the global energy sector has been undergoing a transition to renewable energy. This is due to the growing awareness about climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The UK government has announced its plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. However, this transition poses a challenge for the oil and gas industry, which has been a significant source of employment and revenues for the country.The UK oil and gas sector employs around 40,000 people directly and supports another 100,000 jobs indirectly. These jobs are concentrated in regions like Aberdeen, which has a strong history in the oil and gas industry and has been termed the “Oil Capital of Europe.” The sector also contributes significantly to the UK economy, with oil and gas exports accounting for 3% of GDP.However, the aforementioned industry is also a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report by the Oil and Gas Authority, it accounted for 3.5% of UK’s gas emissions in 2019. This has led to demands for a just transition to a low-carbon economy, which would allow workers in the oil and gas sector to switchover jobs in renewable energy.One of the key demands is the allocation of a just transition fund that would provide financial support for workers who went jobless due to the shift. The Scottish government has already committed to building a just transition fund, which will be financed by the Scottish National Investment Bank.Story continuesThe UK workers’ demand for better wages and working conditions is driven by the fact that their employers have earned significant profits following the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to the increase in oil and gas prices.When the pandemic hit, many companies in the UK, like elsewhere, experienced a decline in revenues due to economic slowdown. However, as the economy started to recover, and oil and gas prices increased, some companies were able to make significant profits.The workers believe that since their employers benefited from the pandemic and the rebound in oil and gas prices, they should also have their share of profits through improved wages and working conditions.Another demand is for training and education in renewable energy. Many workers in the sector have skills and experience that could be suitable for jobs in wind, solar and other renewable energy sectors. However, they might need additional training to make the transition.The UK government has announced a £16 billion plan to create 250,000 jobs in low-carbon industries, such as offshore wind, hydrogen production, and carbon capture and storage. This plan has been welcomed by workers in the oil and gas industry, who see it as an opportunity to transition to jobs in renewable energy.However, there are concerns that the shift may not be as smooth as expected. There is a risk for the workers to be left behind if they do not receive adequate support in terms of the transition. This could lead to job cuts and economic hardship in regions that are heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry.The transition to a low-carbon economy is a complex and challenging process but it is also an opportunity for the UK to lead the way in sustainable energy. The government and the industry must work together to ensure that this transition is just and equitable for all, with support for workers in the oil and gas industry to move to renewable energy jobs. By doing so, UK can create a sustainable and prosperous future for its citizens.In the context of this changing landscape, let’s see how some of the biggest UK-based oil and gas companies like Shell plc, BP plc and TechnipFMC are gearing up for sustainable energy in recent years.Shell has set an ambitious target of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change. To achieve this, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is focusing on reducing its carbon footprint. It is increasing its renewable energy usage and investing in low-carbon technologies like electric vehicle charging, biofuels and hydrogen. The energy supermajor is also committed to reducing its operations’ emission intensity by 65% within 2025, and investing $2-$3 billion every year in new energy technologies.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shell’s continental rival, BP, has also set a target of becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050 or sooner. It has also pledged to reduce its operations’ emissions and its products’ carbon intensity. For this, the company is investing heavily in renewable energy. It aims at increasing its annual low-carbon investment to $5 billion by 2030.BP is also exploring new technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage, and working toward developing new business models that support the transition to a low-carbon economy.Meanwhile, TechnipFMC, a London-based oilfield services provider, has also taken steps toward sustainable energy. The company has formed a new business unit, Technip Energies, which focuses on delivering sustainable solutions across the energy industry. The unit is working on projects like offshore wind farms, green hydrogen production and CCUS. It has set a target of deriving 50% of its revenues from renewable and low-carbon technologies by 2025.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Credited for creating the modern-day Ulta (ULTA) as CEO for eight years, Dillon is wasting no time running a similar growth-minded playbook at Foot Locker.Earlier this month at an investor day, the company revealed its ""Lace Up"" plan. As part of the plan, Foot Locker will shutter 400 underperforming stores mostly in lower-tier malls and focus more on off-mall locations. The company will aim to better segment its various sneaker concepts, too.The Foot Locker brand will target sneaker-heads, while Champs Sports will target performance and athleisure shoppers.Over time, Foot Locker sees itself reaching $10 billion-plus in annual sales and a 10% operating margin. The company today is at about $8.5 billion in sales and a 7% operating margin.Dillon acknowledged that 2023 is a reset year as it works to clean up its store footprint and refine its operating model.""2023 is a reset year, we've been very clear about that. But we're investing in the capabilities that we need to really build the next 50 years of Foot Locker fame, I'll call it. So I'm very excited about that,"" Dillon added.Wall Street is seeing the potential in Foot Locker and praising Dillon for her early round of initiatives.""We think a new steady-state algorithm of ~mid-single-digit percentage sales / +high-single-digit to low-double-digit EPS level is very realistic following a significant reset in 2023 to a much healthier base (shrinking Champs, licensing Asia, resetting Nike),"" said EvercoreISI analyst Omar Saad.Saad added: ""But equally importantly, we think Foot Locker will start to flip the script away from a disintermediation narrative to a grow-with-secularly-healthy-sneaker-demand narrative. And with shares trading at just 9x forward EPS (and 5x target 2026 EPS), we see the potential for the multiple to expand to low-to-mid-teens (FL traded mid-to-high-teens prior to disintermediation concerns) as the model transforms in the coming quarters.""Story continuesYahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi sits down with Foot Locker CEO Mary Dillon.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&amp;P 500.Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.Story continuesThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers. Moreover, these companies also pay out dividends regularly to shareholders, which helps them stay afloat during market downturns. Some companies with solid financials are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which is evident through their decades-long dividend growth histories. In this article, we will discuss the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy.12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Nowmaxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries. These companies are strong dividend payers and have decent yields. We sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data as of Q4 2022.12. Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based diversified manufacturing company that designs various products that belong to the home and automobile industries.

The collective value of these stakes is over $25 million. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.11. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is an American sportswear and footwear retailer which has operations in over 28 countries. Evercore ISI upgraded the stock to Outperform in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $60. The firm appreciated the company's strong business model.Foot Locker, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”10.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. A counter cyclical stock is a term used to describe the shares of a company that operates in an industry or sector that typically experiences financial performance that is inversely correlated to the overall state of the economy. This means that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the general economic trend. During times of economic downturn or recession, the stock price of a counter cyclical company tends to increase, while during times of economic expansion, it tends to decrease in value. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern for the global economy. Although there have been some recent positive developments, the recovery is expected to be moderate over the next two years. The outlook is fragile, and there are many risks that could lead to a decline in economic activity. The uncertainty created by the war could have a severe impact on trade. Additionally, there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities, particularly in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. Although there has been a decline in headline inflation, it remains high and could persist for a more extended period. The global economy experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with a rate of 3.2%, which was more than 1 percentage point lower than the expected rate at the end of 2021. The main reasons for this were the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting cost-of-living crisis in several countries. OECD predicts that growth will continue to be lower than expected in 2023 and 2024.Against the current economic backdrop, investors who used to have portfolios focused on growth are actively seeking stocks that typically perform well during times of economic downturns and slower growth. These types of stocks, such as PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), are known as counter cyclical stocks and tend to perform better during recessions.Story continuesOur Methodology The companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for this list, including discount retailers, tobacco firms, agriculture and food businesses, as well as healthcare and insurance firms. We chose the top counter cyclical stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Don't Miss: 14 Best Stocks to Buy Before the 2023 Recession Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashBest Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now11. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the biggest tobacco and cigarette companies in the world. Demand for tobacco increases when consumers are facing higher stress, unemployment, and financial constraints during economic slowdowns. On March 9, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.27 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 11, to shareholders of record on March 23. On March 1, UBS upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $116, up from $106. The firm predicts a growth acceleration in the shipment of heated tobacco products in mature markets due to Iluma, and appreciates the company's ""strong cash flow"" in the combustible business. Despite Iluma's current margin dilution, UBS suggests that new product launches will generate immediate volume and share growth, with scale benefits to be realized in the second half of 2023. The launch of Bonds for low-end markets and U.S. IQOS in 2024 is expected to further enhance Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s status as the ""best-in-class"" in the tobacco industry.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was part of 47 hedge fund portfolios, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 24.25 million shares worth $2.45 billion. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”10. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), an American agribusiness and food company, is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to watch. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19. Effective from March 15, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) replaced Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) in the S&amp;P 500.On February 9, Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $115, down from $127. The company topped consensus estimates but issued initial 2023 guidance below Street expectations, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. On February 16, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend, a 4.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.44. The dividend is payable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. In 2023, the company announced its 61st consecutive annual dividend increase, making it a reliable dividend king. On March 20, Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but reduced its price target on the shares from $63 to $60. The firm believes that there is a growing possibility of economic challenges ahead for the consumer staples industry. As a result, Deutsche Bank is becoming more worried about the potential risks to the company's future financial performance across much of its coverage.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 400 million shares worth $25.4 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the biggest American discount retailers. On March 16, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.96, beating market estimates by $0.02. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) also reiterated its plans to execute 3,170 real estate projects in fiscal 2023, including 1,050 new store openings, 2,000 remodels, and 120 store relocations. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to monitor. On March 17, Deutsche Bank increased its estimated price on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) shares from $248 to $249 and maintained a Buy rating following the release of the company's Q4 results. According to the firm, it seems that the market underestimated the expected performance of the company in 2023, which is now anticipated to be more heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. Additionally, Deutsche Bank suggests that the decrease in planned share buybacks may be due in part to higher levels of capital expenditures.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), and Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 788,664 shares worth $194.20 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) contributed to performance in the second quarter following the report of first quarter earnings that were above expectations. Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale worldwide. On February 21, Walmart Inc.

It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to watch. According to Morgan Stanley's recent survey, Walmart+ has 18.4 million members, which is equivalent to 14.3% of U.S. households. This figure is slightly higher than the previous survey and almost the same as the record high of 18.6 million members in September 2022. The firm believes that there is still room for more growth in Walmart+ based on the actual number of members and the number of respondents who are very likely to join. Morgan Stanley recommends buying Walmart shares and reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $160 on March 7. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 66 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7 million shares worth $993.2 million.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

The company is experiencing difficulties with its comp sales growth slowing down due to inflation and possible competitive pressures affecting its gross margins. Roth MKM informed investors in a research note that even though Costco is gaining market share and may increase its membership fees, the stock's value is still too high, considering the limited potential earnings upside in FY23.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 937,521 shares worth about $428 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to invest in. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”   Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:20 Most Advanced Countries in the World in 202325 Best Stocks for Dividends11 Best Space Stocks to Invest In Disclosure: None. 11 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our in-depth analysis of how inflation affects the cost of living, go directly and see 5 Cheapest Countries in the World.The UK just experienced double-digit inflation for the first time in forty years. Similarly, the consumer price index (CPI), a key indicator of US inflation, rose by over three times between 2020 and 2021, from 1.4% to 7.0%, after spending more than two decades below 3%. Despite a slight moderation in inflation to 6.0% in February, individual household budgets are under pressure, consumer confidence is suffering, and the cost of living is increasing.Many consumers are putting financial limitations in place as a result of the growing cost of living. 47% of British consumers have already reduced or plan to reduce their overall spending as a result of inflation, according to data analytics company Kantar. 56% of American consumers, according to data by the information firm Morning Consult, are ready to shop less overall. Consumers are placing a higher value on staples over discretionary goods. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the top consumer staples stocks during the current inflationary environment. These companies have consistent pricing power and offer consumers goods that are required regardless of the state of the economy. This is good for the investors, but not so much for the consumers.The continuous supply chain crisis and the conflict in Russia and Ukraine are major contributors to the current high level of inflation, which is pushing up the cost of food, housing and energy prices. A typical household spends one-third of their income on housing. Housing costs have increased by 8%, roughly equal to the overall rate of inflation. Nonetheless, wages in the US climbed by 5.28% in December 2022 compared to the same month the year before. This suggests that the majority of people's largest expense is increasing faster than their income. Likewise, food costs increased by 9.9% in 2022. Almost 12% of household spending goes toward food, making it clear that this is an essential expense that is rising faster than salaries. The price of diesel fuel, which has increased significantly more than the price of gasoline, is a hidden factor in food inflation. Many of the equipment used to produce food and the trucks that transport them run on diesel. The additional expense is being passed on to consumers by the producers.Story continuesAll consumers, even retirees, are directly impacted by inflation in terms of their income, savings, and spending. For many people, the main concern about retirement is the cost of living. It is not unexpected that more people are choosing to retire abroad to cheap countries with a low cost of living, affordable healthcare, better weather, low taxes and a higher quality of life. Living overseas is a significant retirement ambition for 12% of Americans, according to the Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey 2021. But, while choosing a cheap country to relocate to, safety is also quite important.We have produced a list of the cheapest countries in the world, but it is pertinent to note that due to the level of political unrest in most of them, they are also among the most dangerous nations in the world. Therefore, they are extremely unsuitable for retirees to choose while thinking about moving abroad. Having said that, let’s move to the 25 cheapest countries in the world. You can also check out 25 Best Countries For A Comfortable Retirement and 15 Biggest Retirement Mistakes You Will Regret Forever.Our MethodologyFor our list of 25 cheapest countries in the world, we’ve defined a cheap country as one with a low cost of living. For this purpose, we looked at the Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index by Country 2023. Numbeo is a crowd-sourced global database of statistics related to the quality of life, including information on housing indicators, perceived crime rates, healthcare quality, and transportation quality. In order to ascertain the cheapest countries in the world, we only shortlisted countries which ranked in the lower two quintiles of the report. Following that, we cross-referenced the resultant list with Economist Impact’s Global Food Security Index 2022 and averaged out the rankings to determine an average score for each country. For example, since Nigeria ranks 24th in the Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index and 7th in the Global Food Security Index, its average score for the purpose of this article is 15.5. We repeated the procedure for every country, then based on the average score, we selected the top 25 countries and ranked them from lowest to highest.10 Stocks Jim Cramer Is RecommendingStephen Bures / Shutterstock.comCheapest Countries in the World25.

The drug is already approved in the country for the treatment of unresectable biliary tract cancer patients with an FGFR2 fusion gene.Shares of Incyte have plunged 11.1% compared with the industry’s 14.9% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPemigatinib is a selective fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor, indicated for treating MLN. Pemazyre is the first targeted therapy for MLNs, a rare and aggressive group of cancers estimated to affect fewer than 100 patients worldwide.The approval of Pemazyre was based on the phase II FIGHT-203 study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Pemazyre in MLN with an FGFR1 rearrangement.Pemazyre is approved in Europe and the United States and is indicated for treating adults with previously-treated, unresectable, locally-advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an FGFR2 fusion or other rearrangements.Pemazyre was granted Orphan Drug Designation for the second time by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Previously, it was for cholangiocarcinoma, a type of biliary tract cancer, and now it’s for MLNs. The designated orphan drugs are eligible for priority review for marketing authorizations to ensure supply to clinical settings at the earliest opportunity.Incyte has three other approved products, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), Monjuvi (tafasitamab-cxix) and Iclusig (ponatinib), as well as numerous clinical development programs in its portfolio. In addition, a phase II open-label study evaluates pemigatinib in glioblastoma and relapsed or refractory advanced non-small cell lung cancer.Recently, Incyte received a complete response letter for the new drug application for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets, which stated that the FDA could not approve the application in its present form. Shares fell on the same.Story continuesEarlier this month, the company obtained an accelerated approval of Zynyz (Retifanlimab-Dlwr) for treating metastatic or recurrent locally advanced merkel cell carcinoma.

While these chargers are designed to provide high power charging for trucks, delivery vans, buses and other large vehicles, they can also be used to charge passenger cars. Miguel Romero, SDG&amp;E Vice President of Energy InnovationInstalled at Truck Net LLC, 8490 Avenida de la Fuente, near the U.S./Mexico border, the 250-kilowatt (kW) chargers can provide up to 250 miles per hour of charging for a passenger car. They can charge a typical medium-duty box truck from 20%-80% in about an hour and fully charge from empty to 100% in about two hours.The Otay Mesa Port of Entry is the busiest commercial border crossing in California, processing nearly one million commercial trucks and five million privately owned vehicles each year. Idling vehicles waiting to cross the border is a key contributor to air pollution in the San Diego region.""Reducing air pollution and tailpipe emissions are top priorities for our region and California especially in equity priority communities, and SDG&amp;E is committed to building the infrastructure needed to enable businesses and residents to adopt electric vehicles and other clean technologies,"" said SDG&amp;E CEO Caroline Winn. ""We all share the goal of building a cleaner, more sustainable and healthier future.""Winn was joined by several dignitaries at the event, including California Energy Commissioner (CEC) Patty Monahan; San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chair Nora Vargas, who serves on the California Air Resources Board and the County Air Pollution Control District board, in addition to being chair of the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) board.Story continues""Air pollution doesn't recognize national boundaries, and to accommodate the transition to zero-emission trucks on both sides of the border, it's critically important that we rapidly scale up the charging network,"" said Commissioner Monahan. ""The California Energy Commission is helping fund this project and others across the state to build a better and more equitable charging infrastructure system for both cars and trucks.""The chargers are funded by a $200,000 grant through the CEC's Clean Transportation Program. Now in its 14th year, the program has been an essential part in making California a leader in zero-emission transportation, providing more than $1 billion to alternative fuel and vehicle technology projects that deliver health, environmental, and economic benefits to communities. Funding for the program is scheduled to phase out at the end of the year.SDG&amp;E built the underlying infrastructure tying the chargers to the grid, as part of its Power Your Drive for Fleets program. The program connects fleet operators with resources and financial incentives to easily and cost-effectively design and install charging infrastructure for medium and heavy-duty fleets.Chair Vargas, who represents Otay Mesa and who is a leading champion of environmental justice and equity, emphasized the importance of reducing emissions in border communities and communities of color that have historically been overburdened by pollution due their proximity to high traffic corridors.""As a fronteriza and someone who has experienced first-hand the air pollution associated with long lines of idling vehicles waiting to cross the border, I am thrilled to see the electric vehicle chargers installed at this truck stop,"" said Supervisor Nora Vargas, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. ""This is a true community infrastructure solution that proves that through public-private partnerships, we can improve poor air quality for families and children and promote economic prosperity for the binational region.""The project helps support Gov. Gavin Newsom's executive order requiring sales of all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035 and medium and heavy-duty vehicles (class2b-8) to be zero-emission by 2045 where feasible. According to the CEC, nearly a million battery-electric cars have been sold in California and nearly 2,000 zero-emission trucks and buses are on the road today. The state also has more than 80,000 public and shared private EV chargers. The vast majority, about 90%, are Level 2 chargers, which provide 14-35 miles of range per hour of charging. The remaining 10% are DC fast chargers.SDG&amp;E is an innovative San Diego-based energy company that provides clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties. The company is committed to creating a sustainable future by providing its electricity from renewable sources; modernizing natural gas pipelines; accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles; supporting numerous non-profit partners; and, investing in innovative technologies to ensure the reliable operation of the region's infrastructure for generations to come.

A Vulcan spokesman didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.Vulcan has said it hasn’t had access to the facilities since Cemex employees entered earlier this month escorted by Mexican marines in uniform. That dramatic seizure, captured on video, drew criticism from several US senators, who called it an example of “misguided and counterproductive behavior” by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.Operations at Vulcan’s nearby quarry had been shut down since last year in a feud with Lopez Obrador, who accused the company of extracting materials without the proper permits. He reiterated that position last week, accusing Vulcan of “ecocide.”The White House had also weighed in, with an official from the National Security Council saying last week the administration was aware of the reports and is always concerned about the fair treatment of US companies. Mexico’s ambassador to the US, Esteban Moctezuma, met on Monday with lawmakers Monday from Alabama, where Vulcan is based.“I am happy to hear that Mexican governmental forces have now heeded our request to withdraw from Vulcan’s port facility, following a nearly two-week unlawful takeover,” wrote Alabama senator Katie Boyd, one of the lawmakers who met Moctezuma, in a statement.While they are interdependent trade partners, Mexico and the US have been testy neighbors lately. Earlier this month, Lopez Obrador denounced Republican lawmakers who called for sending US troops to bring security to Mexico after a cartel killed two Americans.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest power generation companies in the world.Consistent generation and supply of power is absolutely integral to the development of any economy, and is one of the primary factors behind industrialization and the growth of Western economies. While just the 20 biggest power generation companies in the world earn annual revenues exceeding $2 trillion, their indirect contribution is even more significant as power supply is the backbone for the vast majority of industries across all sectors, across the world.Despite its importance, 2022 was not a very good year for the power and utility sector generally, but in the U.S., sales still continued to increase as demand jumped with the country mostly recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, even though revenues increased significantly because of the aforementioned demand, costs increased even more as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to energy supplies being depleted and prices more than doubling. Meanwhile, grid resilience is continuing to be tested from catastrophic climate events, one of the biggest global risks for 2023. To combat this issue, the biggest players in the industry, including some of the biggest power generation companies in the world, improved their reserves, deployed microgrids and worked on improving their infrastructure as well.25 biggest power generation companies in the worldPhoto by American Public Power Association on UnsplashWhile these developments are likely to increase further in 2023 and even beyond, it is important to remember that as the Russian Ukraine war continues with no idea of when hostilities will cease, electricity prices are likely to stay high in 2023 while inflation and supply chain issues will add to the challenges that the industry is facing right now. Other issues such as extreme weather events and even cybersecurity will require innovation to ensure that power generation and its supply remains stable.Story continuesAs is true for most industries, the investment viability of the biggest power generation companies in the world doesn't just depend on revenue and profits but Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), which is continuing to gain momentum, especially with regards to decarbonization practices as companies try to identify societal and environmental disrupters while focus on resolving them. While such disclosures in the U.S. aren't uniform across power generation companies, this will also change in 2023, after a new SEC proposal in March 2022 regarding certain public disclosures.Another important consideration for the power generation industry is the requirement of a shift from using non-renewable resources to renewable resources. Companies creating clean energy have a lot of incentives, grants and subsidies from the government. This is why NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), the biggest renewables energy company by market cap, is also the biggest power generation company by market cap. According its Q4 2022 earnings call, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) CEO stated ""In short, we believe the IRA provides growth visibility for a broad range of low-cost, clean energy solutions in a predictable way and for a long time. We believe that in this environment, low-cost renewables will help NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners continue to drive long-term value for our customers and our shareholders and unitholders."" This just helps signify the important of renewable energy production in this industry.The biggest power generation companies in the world are dominated by state-owned companies which earn significant amounts of revenue. To determine our list, we ranked them based on trailing twelve month (TTM) revenue and the latest market, both obtained from Yahoo Finance. We assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap. In case of private companies, we determined their revenue from Fortune Global 500, and ranked them based on revenue alone.

After Oil prices peaked back in mid-2022 at around $130 a barrel, they have been grinding lower. Most recently oil prices broke down below $70, which seemed to be a major level for many investors.But after breaking down, oil prices have reversed higher quite aggressively, and are already back above the $70 level. It is possible that after such a long period of bullish sentiment, the oil market needed to shake the late comers before setting up another bull move higher.Furthermore, a couple weeks ago, OPEC publicly committed to limiting production and tightening oil supply, thus putting a floor beneath the market.Several energy stocks look to be setting up for another rally, and using the Zacks Rank, I have identified three that look particularly promising. Based on their rankings, it is likely that these stocks will outperform over the next few months.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewPar PacificPar Pacific PARR manages and maintains energy and infrastructure businesses.

CVI has been a strong performing stock over the last year although the upward movement has stopped since oil prices reversed last year. CVI also offers a hefty dividend yield of 6.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOver the next few earnings periods sales are expected to fall, but current quarter earnings are still expected to skyrocket 4,300% YoY to $0.88 per share. Over the last 60 days analysts have unanimously revised earnings higher across all reporting periods. Current year earnings expectations have nearly doubled over the last three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCVI is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 9x, which is below its 10-year median of 12x, and above the industry average 5x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero EnergyValero Energy VLO is a deeply diversified oil refinery company with 15 plants across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean and capacity to refine 3.2 million barrels a day.

Even with the substantial move lower in the price of oil, Valero stock has remained strong.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValero Energy earns a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 186% YoY to $6.62 per share, while current quarter sale are expected to drop -13% to $33.5 billion.Although there have been some slight revisions lower in the current quarter recently, earnings have still been revised much higher over the last three months. Furthermore, all other earnings periods have been revised considerably higher, with current year earnings upgraded by 36%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVLO is trading at a very reasonable 5x one-year forward earnings, which is in line with the industry and well below its five-year median of 13x.

348,122aecf8-d733-3f48-97e4-c937f563c51c,UNH,2023-03-28,"‘The End of the Bear Market May Be in Sight,’ Says Morgan Stanley. Here Are 3 Stocks the Banking Giant Likes for Long-Term Growth",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/end-bear-market-may-sight-204211341.html,1679949731,STORY,['UNH'],"[This year started with a strong rally in the markets, but the past month has seen the positive sentiments start to sputter. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank started fears of a contagion and consequent bank runs, which were only partially offset by Federal regulatory actions. But there’s a growing consensus that it was the Federal actions that set the conditions for the bank crisis, when the central bank raised interest rates to fight inflation. Now, investors are trying to cope with the fallout: a simmering bank troubles, persistent high inflation, and elevated interest rates.But not all is doom and gloom. According to Mike Wilson, the chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, what we’re seeing now may herald the beginning of the end in the bear market. While the market is volatile, Wilson describes a positive set-up for investors looking to hold stocks for the long-term.“From an equity market perspective, the [recent] events mean that credit availability is decreasing for a wide swath of the economy, which may be the catalyst that finally convinces market participants that earnings estimates are too high. We have been waiting patiently for this acknowledgment because with it comes the real buying opportunity… We think this is exactly how bear markets end,” Wilson opined.The stock analysts at Morgan Stanley are following Wilson’s lead, and pointing out the equities that offer solid opportunities for the long-term. We’ve looked up the details on three of these picks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH)First up is the world’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth. The company is primarily a provider of health insurance policies, and in partnership with employers, providers, and governments, it makes healthcare accessible to more than 151 million people.The scale of this business is visible in the company’s earnings reports. In the last reported quarter, 4Q22, UnitedHealth showed a quarterly top line of $82.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year and some $270 million ahead of expectations. At the bottom line, the company had a non-GAAP EPS of $5.34, up 19% y/y, and above consensus estimate of $5.17. For the full year, UnitedHealth had revenues of $324 billion, for a 13% y/y gain. The firm’s full-year adjusted net earnings came to $22.19 per share.Story continuesLooking ahead, UNH is guiding toward $357 billion to $360 billion in revenues for 2023, and is projecting to bring in $24.40 to $24.90 in adjusted net EPS.Covering this stock for Morgan Stanley, 5-star analyst Erin Wright lays out a simple case for investors to consider, saying, “In health insurance, scale is king and UNH is the largest national insurer with top-three position in almost all insurance end markets. We believe the resiliency of UNH’s diversified businesses will generate long-term double-digit earnings growth with high visibility as a best-in-class vertically integrated MCO in a highly defensive category.”To this end, Wright rates UNH shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her price target of $587 implies a gain of ~22% on the one-year time horizon. (To watch Wright’s track record, click here)Overall, the Strong Buy consensus on this stock is backed by 10 recent analyst reviews, featuring a 9 to 1 breakdown favoring Buys over Holds. The stock’s average price target of $599.33 indicates potential for a 24% one-year upside from the current share price of $481.82. As a small bonus, the company also pays regular dividends that currently yield 1.4% annually. (See UNH stock forecast)T-Mobile US (TMUS)The next Morgan Stanley pick we’re looking at is another giant of its industry. T-Mobile is one of the best-known names in the US wireless business, and is the second-largest provider of wireless networking services in the US market.As of the end of 2022, the company had 1.4 million new postpaid accounts for the year, and a total net customer count of 113.6 million. T-Mobile is a leader in the rollout of 5G services in the US, and boasted 2.6 million high-speed internet customers at the end of 2022.Large customer counts and hefty market share have led to strong earnings results. T-Mobile’s last quarterly release, for 4Q22, showed $1.18 in GAAP EPS, beating the forecast by 8 cents, or 7%, and rising an impressive 247% year-over-year.The company achieved those earnings results despite a modest miss in revenue. The quarterly top line of $20.3 billion was $39 million below expectations, and slipped 2.4% y/y.The free cash flow, however, really stood out. T-Mobile generated $2.2 billion in FCF for Q4, and its full-year FCF figure, of $7.7 billion, shown an ‘industry-leading’ increase of 36% while also beating previously published guidance. The company’s cash generation made it possible to support share value by repurchasing 21.4 million shares in 2022 for a total of $3 billion.This stock got the nod from Simon Flannery, another of Morgan Stanley’s 5-star analysts. Flannery wrote of TMUS: “The company has a clear growth strategy predicated primarily on share gains in key, underpenetrated markets: small town/rural, enterprise and top 100 market network seekers. Additionally, T-Mobile has led the way on fixed wireless home broadband as a brand new market opportunity for the company that’s expected to scale to 7-8mn subs by 2025.”Tracking this stance forward, Flannery rates TMUS shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) with a $175 price target indicating ~22% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Flannery’s track record, click here)No fewer than 14 of Wall Street’s analysts have reviewed T-Mobile’s shares recently, and they’ve given the stock 12 Buys and 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are trading for $143.90, with an average price target of $181 to suggest ~26% upside potential by the end of this year. (See TMUS stock forecast)Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)We’ll wrap up this list of Morgan Stanley’s long-term stock picks with Thermo Fisher Scientific, an important player in the field of laboratory research.Thermo Fisher is a maker and supplier of laboratory equipment – scientific instruments, chemicals and reagents, sampling and testing supplies, and even lab-related software systems. Thermo Fisher works with a broad customer base, serving any clients in any field involving lab work; the company frequently deals with academics, medical researchers, and government entities.While Thermo Fisher occupies a highly particular niche, supplying research labs has been profitable in the post-pandemic world. The company’s 4Q22 results saw both the top and bottom line beat expectations, even if they did not expand year-over-year. At the top line, the quarterly revenue of $11.45 billion was a full $1.04 billion above the forecast, while at the bottom line the non-GAAP EPS of $5.40 was 20 cents ahead of consensus estimates.Thermo Fisher caught the eye of Morgan Stanley analyst Tejas Savant who writes: “We like TMO for the breadth of its portfolio, diversified customer base and scale – attributes that we believe will prove advantageous in navigating a potential recession, in addition to inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. TMO’s favorable end market exposure, PPI business system, and track record of consistent all-weather execution underpin our confidence in management’s long-term core organic growth target of 7- 9% with mid-teens EPS growth.”Unsurprisingly, Savant rates TMO shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), while his $670 suggests the stock will grow 19% in the year ahead. (To watch Savant’s track record, click here)Overall, this stock has picked up 14 recent analyst reviews, and these include 12 Buys that overbalance 1 Hold and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s average price target of $656.71 implies ~17% one-year gain from the current share price of $561.69.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&amp;P 500.Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.Story continuesThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers. Moreover, these companies also pay out dividends regularly to shareholders, which helps them stay afloat during market downturns. Some companies with solid financials are The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) which is evident through their decades-long dividend growth histories. In this article, we will discuss the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to buy.12 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Nowmaxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries. These companies are strong dividend payers and have decent yields. We sorted these dividend stocks using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data as of Q4 2022.12. Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based diversified manufacturing company that designs various products that belong to the home and automobile industries. On February 23, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend.

As of March 27, the stock has a dividend yield of 5.70%.Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) holds a strong dividend growth track record like other dividend stocks such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG).Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) reported a solid cash position in FY22 as its operating cash flow for the year came in at $441 million, which showed a 63% growth from the same period last year.At the end of Q4 2022, 12 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database owned stakes in Leggett &amp; Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), compared with 14 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $25 million. Among these hedge funds, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.11. Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL) is an American sportswear and footwear retailer which has operations in over 28 countries. Evercore ISI upgraded the stock to Outperform in March and also raised its price target on the stock to $60. The firm appreciated the company's strong business model.Foot Locker, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”10.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. A counter cyclical stock is a term used to describe the shares of a company that operates in an industry or sector that typically experiences financial performance that is inversely correlated to the overall state of the economy. This means that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the general economic trend. During times of economic downturn or recession, the stock price of a counter cyclical company tends to increase, while during times of economic expansion, it tends to decrease in value. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern for the global economy. Although there have been some recent positive developments, the recovery is expected to be moderate over the next two years. The outlook is fragile, and there are many risks that could lead to a decline in economic activity. The uncertainty created by the war could have a severe impact on trade. Additionally, there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities, particularly in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. Although there has been a decline in headline inflation, it remains high and could persist for a more extended period. The global economy experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with a rate of 3.2%, which was more than 1 percentage point lower than the expected rate at the end of 2021. The main reasons for this were the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting cost-of-living crisis in several countries. OECD predicts that growth will continue to be lower than expected in 2023 and 2024.Against the current economic backdrop, investors who used to have portfolios focused on growth are actively seeking stocks that typically perform well during times of economic downturns and slower growth. These types of stocks, such as PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), are known as counter cyclical stocks and tend to perform better during recessions.Story continuesOur Methodology The companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for this list, including discount retailers, tobacco firms, agriculture and food businesses, as well as healthcare and insurance firms. We chose the top counter cyclical stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Don't Miss: 14 Best Stocks to Buy Before the 2023 Recession Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Franki Chamaki on UnsplashBest Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now11. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the biggest tobacco and cigarette companies in the world. Demand for tobacco increases when consumers are facing higher stress, unemployment, and financial constraints during economic slowdowns. On March 9, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.27 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 11, to shareholders of record on March 23. On March 1, UBS upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $116, up from $106. The firm predicts a growth acceleration in the shipment of heated tobacco products in mature markets due to Iluma, and appreciates the company's ""strong cash flow"" in the combustible business. Despite Iluma's current margin dilution, UBS suggests that new product launches will generate immediate volume and share growth, with scale benefits to be realized in the second half of 2023. The launch of Bonds for low-end markets and U.S. IQOS in 2024 is expected to further enhance Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s status as the ""best-in-class"" in the tobacco industry.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was part of 47 hedge fund portfolios, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 24.25 million shares worth $2.45 billion. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”10. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), an American agribusiness and food company, is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to watch.

The company topped consensus estimates but issued initial 2023 guidance below Street expectations, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)9.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 400 million shares worth $25.4 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the biggest American discount retailers. On March 16, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.96, beating market estimates by $0.02. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) also reiterated its plans to execute 3,170 real estate projects in fiscal 2023, including 1,050 new store openings, 2,000 remodels, and 120 store relocations. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to monitor. On March 17, Deutsche Bank increased its estimated price on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) shares from $248 to $249 and maintained a Buy rating following the release of the company's Q4 results. According to the firm, it seems that the market underestimated the expected performance of the company in 2023, which is now anticipated to be more heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. Additionally, Deutsche Bank suggests that the decrease in planned share buybacks may be due in part to higher levels of capital expenditures.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), and Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 788,664 shares worth $194.20 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) contributed to performance in the second quarter following the report of first quarter earnings that were above expectations. Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale worldwide. On February 21, Walmart Inc.

This figure is slightly higher than the previous survey and almost the same as the record high of 18.6 million members in September 2022. The firm believes that there is still room for more growth in Walmart+ based on the actual number of members and the number of respondents who are very likely to join. Morgan Stanley recommends buying Walmart shares and reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $160 on March 7. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 66 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7 million shares worth $993.2 million.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

355,aeef77ed-1aae-3ee7-8392-6a625224f9a9,PG,2023-03-28,25 Cheapest Countries in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-cheapest-countries-world-134036330.html,1679924436,STORY,"['KO', 'PG', 'PEP']","[In this article, we talk about the 25 cheapest countries in the world. To skip our in-depth analysis of how inflation affects the cost of living, go directly and see 5 Cheapest Countries in the World.The UK just experienced double-digit inflation for the first time in forty years. Similarly, the consumer price index (CPI), a key indicator of US inflation, rose by over three times between 2020 and 2021, from 1.4% to 7.0%, after spending more than two decades below 3%. Despite a slight moderation in inflation to 6.0% in February, individual household budgets are under pressure, consumer confidence is suffering, and the cost of living is increasing.Many consumers are putting financial limitations in place as a result of the growing cost of living. 47% of British consumers have already reduced or plan to reduce their overall spending as a result of inflation, according to data analytics company Kantar. 56% of American consumers, according to data by the information firm Morning Consult, are ready to shop less overall. Consumers are placing a higher value on staples over discretionary goods. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the top consumer staples stocks during the current inflationary environment. These companies have consistent pricing power and offer consumers goods that are required regardless of the state of the economy. This is good for the investors, but not so much for the consumers.The continuous supply chain crisis and the conflict in Russia and Ukraine are major contributors to the current high level of inflation, which is pushing up the cost of food, housing and energy prices. A typical household spends one-third of their income on housing. Housing costs have increased by 8%, roughly equal to the overall rate of inflation. Nonetheless, wages in the US climbed by 5.28% in December 2022 compared to the same month the year before. This suggests that the majority of people's largest expense is increasing faster than their income. Likewise, food costs increased by 9.9% in 2022. Almost 12% of household spending goes toward food, making it clear that this is an essential expense that is rising faster than salaries. The price of diesel fuel, which has increased significantly more than the price of gasoline, is a hidden factor in food inflation. Many of the equipment used to produce food and the trucks that transport them run on diesel. The additional expense is being passed on to consumers by the producers.Story continuesAll consumers, even retirees, are directly impacted by inflation in terms of their income, savings, and spending. For many people, the main concern about retirement is the cost of living. It is not unexpected that more people are choosing to retire abroad to cheap countries with a low cost of living, affordable healthcare, better weather, low taxes and a higher quality of life. Living overseas is a significant retirement ambition for 12% of Americans, according to the Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey 2021. But, while choosing a cheap country to relocate to, safety is also quite important.We have produced a list of the cheapest countries in the world, but it is pertinent to note that due to the level of political unrest in most of them, they are also among the most dangerous nations in the world. Therefore, they are extremely unsuitable for retirees to choose while thinking about moving abroad. Having said that, let’s move to the 25 cheapest countries in the world. You can also check out 25 Best Countries For A Comfortable Retirement and 15 Biggest Retirement Mistakes You Will Regret Forever.Our MethodologyFor our list of 25 cheapest countries in the world, we’ve defined a cheap country as one with a low cost of living. For this purpose, we looked at the Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index by Country 2023. Numbeo is a crowd-sourced global database of statistics related to the quality of life, including information on housing indicators, perceived crime rates, healthcare quality, and transportation quality. In order to ascertain the cheapest countries in the world, we only shortlisted countries which ranked in the lower two quintiles of the report. Following that, we cross-referenced the resultant list with Economist Impact’s Global Food Security Index 2022 and averaged out the rankings to determine an average score for each country. For example, since Nigeria ranks 24th in the Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index and 7th in the Global Food Security Index, its average score for the purpose of this article is 15.5. We repeated the procedure for every country, then based on the average score, we selected the top 25 countries and ranked them from lowest to highest.10 Stocks Jim Cramer Is RecommendingStephen Bures / Shutterstock.comCheapest Countries in the World25.

Vornado Realty says it’s the largest 4K LED sign in the world.And finally, Vornado Realty owns several other mixed-use buildings in New York City that contain offices, restaurants, fitness centers, outdoor gardens and lounges.In addition to its own properties, Vornado Realty also has a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s Inc. (NYSE: ALX), a REIT that owns six properties in the New York City metropolitan area.While its portfolio is certainly noteworthy, since the beginning of February, Vornado Realty has lost almost half its value. One major reason for this was the 29.2% quarterly dividend reduction from $0.53 to $0.375 that was announced on January 19.This was the first time Vornado Realty had cut its quarterly dividend since August 2020 when the dividend was reduced from $0.66 to $0.53 per share. With the recent price decline, the present annual yield of $1.50 per share is 10.07%, but the payout ratio has now been reduced to a manageable 56%.Another factor that has negatively impacted its share price is the decision to halt construction on an 18-million-square-foot project in midtown Manhattan. It was supposed to be part of a $22 billion redevelopment of Penn Station to include 10 new skyscrapers with office space and 1,800 apartments. However, a lack of demand for office space, higher interest rates and other factors led Vornado Realty to postpone the construction for at least two or three years.Vornado Realty’s CEO, Steven Roth, said that new construction was “almost impossible,” given tight lending in 2023 and that the work-from-home movement has also hurt the general office market.Vornado Realty’s management made it clear on its November Q3 conference call that since taxable income is expected to be lower in 2023, the Board of Trustees will determine the best size of the dividend commensurate with that net income. Some investors are still wary that in addition to the February cut, another dividend reduction could be forthcoming.One reason for declining income could be Meta pulling back on leasing more space as it laid off 11,000 employees or 13% of its workforce in November. Following that announcement, Vornado Realty tried to minimize the impact, saying it wouldn’t make that much of a difference to its occupancy levels.But with Meta being one of Vornado’s largest office tenants, investors disagreed. And just a few weeks ago, Meta announced it was cutting another 10,000 jobs globally while leaving 5,000 jobs unfilled. CEO Mark Zuckerberg called these decisions part of Meta’s “Year of Efficiency,” and said it was possible this new economic reality will continue for years to come.In December, Vornado Realty was also hit hard by its removal from the S&amp;P 500 index, as well as a downgrade by Citigroup analyst Nicholas Joseph, from Neutral to Sell. On March 3, BMO Capital analyst John Kim also downgraded Vornado Realty from Market Perform to Underperform, while considerably reducing his price target from $26 to $18.Despite all these negatives, in early February, BlackRock increased its position in Vornado Realty to 20.41 million shares, representing about 10.6% ownership of the company stock. But shares are down more than 30% since that purchase.Q4 operating results were mixed. Vornado Realty announced funds from operations (FFO) of $0.72, which beat the consensus estimates of $0.67 but was a penny below Q4 2021. Revenue of $446.94 was below the street’s expectations by $5.94 million but was 6.14% better than revenue of $421.08 million in Q4 2021.This week, analyst Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler upgraded Vornado Realty from Underweight to Neutral, commenting that the valuation of this stock implies that no one will ever lease offices again. His belief that the selling is overdone was shared by investors, who sent the stock up 3.55% on the day.On March 21, Goldman Sachs analyst Caitlin Burrows resumed coverage of Vornado Realty, along with 12 other office, retail and industrial REITs. Burrows feels that office occupancy rates will take a while to improve, but that “weak or uncertain macro conditions could shift the balance of power more in favor of employers versus employees.” As employers gain more leverage, they will insist that employees return to working from offices.However, despite resuming coverage, Burrows rates Vornado Realty a Sell, so that’s hardly a ringing endorsement.Vornado Realty owns and operates some of the most attractive commercial real estate in the United States. New York City is the center of commerce, and Chicago and San Francisco are also strong markets. It’s been in business for 64 years and has grown substantially with each passing decade.But despite its diversity of strong retail tenants, about 17% of its office tenants are in technology companies, and with many of these companies tightening their belts by laying off workers, Vornado Realty’s road ahead could be quite difficult. Even CEO Roth has admitted as much. As of November 2022, its total office occupancy in New York City had fallen from a pre-pandemic rate of 97% to just 90.8%.Investors presently considering a purchase of Vornado Realty should be willing to ride the bumpy road of higher interest rates, which could lead to a possible recession with deleterious effects on office and retail occupancy.On the other hand, shares are inexpensive right now with a Price/FFO (P/F) multiple of only 5.59 and an enticing dividend yield. But short interest as a percentage of float at the end of February was approaching 11%, so the downward pressure on the stock will be in effect for a while.Looking ahead, the most salient questions of 2023 for Vornado Realty are how much Vornado Realty’s income might be affected by declining office occupancies from tenant workforce layoffs and if the 10% dividend yield could be cut for the third time since 2020. Potential investors should weigh these questions before making purchases of Vornado Realty stock.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 countries with the best hospitals in the world.Across nearly all developed countries in the world, universal healthcare is available to its residents, with the only main exception being the United States. In the U.S., healthcare has been privatized, to the benefit of companies engaged in the industry and the detriment of people actually requiring healthcare. While many would consider healthcare and access to hospitals a basic right, that's not the case in the U.S. where health insurance is mainly tied to a person's employment and without insurance, the costs are exorbitant to the point that people are forced to live with pain rather than be able to seek treatment.However, on the other hand, the U.S. is definitely one of the countries with the best hospitals in the world, and several hospitals in the country are famous across the world for the service they provide, not to mention being the center of major developments in medicine. After all, several of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world are based in the U.S., including some of the companies that came up with the Covid-19 vaccine in record time to enable the world to come out of a pandemic in a relatively short period of time, saving tens of millions of lives and possibly hundreds of millions, if not billions, of infections.25 countries with the best hospitals in the worldPixabay/Public DomainHealthcare is one of the biggest industries in the world, and has had relative success in 2022 compared to the broader market. The healthcare sector, including some of the largest healthcare companies by market cap such as Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) and Elevance Health Inc. (NYSE:ELV). Meanwhile, according to JPMorgan, healthcare companies are quite optimistic about industry performance in 2023, with around 48% of all executives interviewed providing an optimistic outlook, a huge improvement compared to the overall industry average of 22%. Further, 91% of respondents believed that their revenue would either be maintained or increased even as a majority expect a recession in 2023.Story continuesWhile major companies, especially in the tech industry, have been laying off tens of thousands of employees including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the healthcare industry has maintained optimism in this respect as well, with the vast majority expecting either to maintain their current staff levels or even expect to add to headcount. Working capital optimization is also among the most important considerations for many healthcare companies to maximize cashflow.The importance of hospitals in the fight against constantly evolving diseases cannot be understated, with hospitals constantly undergoing innovations with help from the healthcare industry. This is why hospitals are continuing to adapt to existing as well as new challenges. According to David Bates, chief of general internal medicine and primary care at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital ""We had to very rapidly convert beds to ICU beds, and close large sections of the hospital, then come up with staff to cover those beds. There were also great challenges with managing our supply chain for things like ventilators and personal protective equipment.""After all, hospitals were heavily impacted because of Covid-19, but unlike other industries, the impact was because of much higher demand than supply, with many being overwhelmed by the number of patients requiring intensive care. Staff had to work around the clock even as lockdowns were imposed in most nations, because hospital staff were deemed to be integral. The pandemic also caused global supply chain issues and hospitals and the healthcare industry in general was not exempt from it. Hospitals have been able to learn from this though and the Director of the Department of Internal Medicine at University Hospital Zurich, Dr. Christoph Meier said ""Many lessons could be learned from COVID, such as recognizing the efficacy of virtual meetings, valuing the importance of hospital hygiene and emphasizing the importance of generalists over siloed specialization. The biggest challenge was the joint setting of individual priorities for a common goal.""This is especially important for some of the biggest hospital stocks out there, including HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) which owns and operates close to 190 hospitals in addition to around 2,000 various sites of care, and Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC), which owns 65 hospitals and more than 450 healthcare facilities. As Covid patient numbers have started to fall across the world, revenues across hospitals have been impacted negatively, while there has also been a shift in patients trends, with more outpatients than inpatients as compared to the previous year. Since inpatients generally require extensive treatments and tests, not to mention surgeries, this shifting trend has also resulted in revenue declining. In the Q4 2022 earning calls for Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS), one of the largest hospital stocks, the company's CEO said ""During the fourth quarter, our acute care hospitals experienced a decrease in the number of patients with a COVID diagnosis treated in our hospitals as compared to the prior year quarter. As a percentage of total admissions, COVID diagnosed patients made up 7% of our admissions in the fourth quarter of 2021, but only about half of that percentage of admissions in the fourth quarter of 2022. This decline in COVID patients resulted in reduced revenues due to the lower acuity and less of the incremental government reimbursement associated with COVID patients.""Determine the countries with the best hospitals in the world was not an easy task, as there are little objective assessments out there. For our ranking, we initially obtained Newsweek's list of best 250 hospitals in 2022 and 2023, and then assigned a score to each hospital based on its ranking. For example, if a hospital ranked number 1 in one year, it was given a score of 250/250 = 1, while second placed was given a score of 249/250 = 0.996 and so on. We then added the scores of all hospitals in a specific country to obtain the country's score. We then used the average score of both 2022 and 2023 to calculate our rankings, with the ranking being based on highest score to lowest. So, let's now take a look at the hospitals you'd want to get treated at, starting with:25. ThailandTotal score for hospitals: 0.348The Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok is the reason why Thailand has made this list. However, other hospitals in the country do provide a high level of care at a relatively lower cost, making it an attractive destination for people from other countries to seek treatment from.24. MexicoTotal score for hospitals: 0.350A lot of people in the U.S. go to Mexico for treatment, because the costs are significantly cheaper even after including travel and accommodation costs, while the level of healthcare is still relatively high. However, there is a danger because of the threat of violence, as seen in the recent case of an American going for treatment to Mexico, and two of the four people were killed and one was injured.23. ColombiaTotal score for hospitals: 0.382You might be surprised to hear that Colombia is among the countries with the best hospitals in the world, but it does have one world-class healthcare institute in Fundación Valle Del Lili, located in Cali.22. IndiaTotal score for hospitals: 1.152While India's healthcare system is nowhere near good enough to support its massive and consistently growing population, it is home to some top hospitals including All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi.21. IsraelTotal score for hospitals: 1.782Israel is home to one of the most technologically advanced healthcare systems in the world, as hospitals are equipped with highly trained staff and modern facilities. Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv is the highest ranked hospital in the country.20. NorwayTotal score for hospitals: 1.892Norway is an extremely rich country thanks to its massive oil deposits, though it has used its wealth to improve the quality of life of its residents, which includes healthcare, and Oslo Universitetssykehus is its highest ranked hospital/19. BelgiumTotal score for hospitals: 2.056Four of Belgium's hospitals are in Newsweek's top 250 hospitals list, making it one of the countries with the best hospitals in the world. The best hospital in the country is UZ Leuven, located in Leuven/Pellenberg.18. AustraliaTotal score for hospitals: 2.492Both public and private hospitals in Australia provide an excellent level of healthcare, with public healthcare resulting in extremely low costs for residents in the country. Medicare is the publicly-funded universal healthcare system in the country, which has been criticized recently for a declining level of quality.17. BrazilTotal score for hospitals: 2.776The country with the best hospitals in Latin America, Brazil's top hospital is Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, located in Sao Paulo.16. SwedenTotal score for hospitals: 2.834Nordic countries have a strong presence in our list, and Sweden is no exception, with 6 entries in Newsweek's top 250 hospital list, with the top ranked hospital being Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset.15. SingaporeTotal score for hospitals: 2.882Even though Singapore has a population of just over 5 million people, it's still one of the countries with the best hospitals in the world, with high competition in the industry leading to lower costs and a better patient experience.14. FinlandTotal score for hospitals: 2.942Proper healthcare is guaranteed in Finland through its Constitution, with the country's best hospital being the Helsinki University Hospital.13. DenmarkTotal score for hospitals: 3.026The best country for hospitals in the Nordics, with most of its high-quality services being financed through taxes and hence, providing high-quality services to all residents.12. AustriaTotal score for hospitals: 3.808European countries dominate the list of countries with the best hospitals in the world, and even though healthcare is primarily public, options for private healthcare exist as well.11. United KingdomTotal score for hospitals: 4.226While the National Health Service, the publicly funded healthcare system in the UK, has been lauded for its level of quality, many are complaining that the NHS is now overloaded which has led to a deterioration in said quality. Many nurses in the system are going on strikes to demand higher pay which has resulted in hospitals not being able to provide the level of service and treatment that they are known for.Click to continue reading and see the 10 countries with the best hospitals in the world.Suggested articles:15 Most Promising Stocks to Buy According to Analysts12 Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy Now15 Biggest Potash Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 25 countries with the best hospitals in the world is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission is going to give the necessary regulatory approval for this buyout, which is expected to be completed by the middle of 2024 by Pennsylvania American Water.Benefits of the BuyoutBeing the leading water and wastewater provider in the Commonwealth, Pennsylvania American Water aims to provide the best long-term solution for water and wastewater utility services. The latest transaction is likely to further strengthen this unit’s position in wastewater utility operations.Pennsylvania American Water already provides reliable water and wastewater services to approximately 2.4 million people in the Commonwealth. With the Towamencin Municipal Authority serving more than 6,300 wastewater customers, its wastewater system acquisition will add to the unit’s customer base, thereby bolstering its revenue generation prospect.Reason Behind the AcquisitionPer the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently in service.Per the ASCE finding, 6 billion gallons of treated water go waste every day in the United States, owing to a delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance. Important upgrades and infrastructure repairs get delayed at times, due to a lack of adequate funds and a large number of small operators in the industry.The acquisition of small units by larger utilities is the need of the hour, as it ensures necessary investments for infrastructure upgrades and delivery of high-quality services to customers. American Water Works is the largest and most geographically diverse publicly traded water and wastewater utility company, which continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions like the latest one.Story continuesWater Utilities Continue to ConsolidateAWK continues to expand operations through acquisitions and organic means.

(NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP).What Happened: In the upcoming Indian Premier League, or IPL — the country's most popular franchise cricket tournament — Campa Cola will be seen as a “pouring partner” for three teams, Lucknow Super Giants, Punjab Kings Squad and Sunrisers Hyderabad.See Also On Benzinga India: What Is Campa Cola’s Share Price And How To Buy?Campa Cola is expected to be widely available in various trade channels in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana among others by the start of the IPL season in end-March, sources familiar with the development told the Hindu Business Line.Earlier this month, Reliance Industries launched its Campa range of chilled beverages, with the initial introduction in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The beverage brand intends to increase its visibility during the IPL by engaging in activities such as title sponsorship, and partnering with teams for jersey branding and refreshment.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical stocks and their outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Consumer cyclical stocks are companies that are highly sensitive to changes in the business cycle and consumer spending patterns. These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer.Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&amp;P 500.Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December.Story continuesThe recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It's about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.In these market conditions, analysts recommend focusing on companies with strong free cash flows as they perform better than their peers.

Here is what the firm has to say:“Finally, Foot Locker (NYSE:FL) came under significant pressure during the quarter, with the stock down more than 50% from its highs and valuation not far from early 2020 lows. Nike continues to place a greater focus on their Direct-to-Consumer business, which will decrease their contribution to Foot Locker’s total sales, retreating to historical averages of 50% by 2023. While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS &amp; Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024. The company’s balance sheet remains very strong with $800M in cash and management is increasing returns to shareholders through raising the dividend by 40% and announcing a $1.2B share buyback (more than 40% of the float at current share prices). With the next 12 to 18 months as a transition period for the company, the share price weakness provides attractive reward/risk investment potential, near 3x Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Income, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EV/EBITDA) and close to a 30% normalized free cash flow yield.”10.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Counter Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. A counter cyclical stock is a term used to describe the shares of a company that operates in an industry or sector that typically experiences financial performance that is inversely correlated to the overall state of the economy. This means that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the general economic trend. During times of economic downturn or recession, the stock price of a counter cyclical company tends to increase, while during times of economic expansion, it tends to decrease in value. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern for the global economy. Although there have been some recent positive developments, the recovery is expected to be moderate over the next two years. The outlook is fragile, and there are many risks that could lead to a decline in economic activity. The uncertainty created by the war could have a severe impact on trade. Additionally, there are concerns about financial vulnerabilities, particularly in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. Although there has been a decline in headline inflation, it remains high and could persist for a more extended period. The global economy experienced a slowdown in growth in 2022, with a rate of 3.2%, which was more than 1 percentage point lower than the expected rate at the end of 2021. The main reasons for this were the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting cost-of-living crisis in several countries. OECD predicts that growth will continue to be lower than expected in 2023 and 2024.Against the current economic backdrop, investors who used to have portfolios focused on growth are actively seeking stocks that typically perform well during times of economic downturns and slower growth. These types of stocks, such as PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), are known as counter cyclical stocks and tend to perform better during recessions.Story continuesOur Methodology The companies that tend to outperform the wider market during economic downturns or recessions were selected for this list, including discount retailers, tobacco firms, agriculture and food businesses, as well as healthcare and insurance firms. We chose the top counter cyclical stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.

Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the biggest tobacco and cigarette companies in the world. Demand for tobacco increases when consumers are facing higher stress, unemployment, and financial constraints during economic slowdowns. On March 9, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) declared a $1.27 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on April 11, to shareholders of record on March 23. On March 1, UBS upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $116, up from $106. The firm predicts a growth acceleration in the shipment of heated tobacco products in mature markets due to Iluma, and appreciates the company's ""strong cash flow"" in the combustible business. Despite Iluma's current margin dilution, UBS suggests that new product launches will generate immediate volume and share growth, with scale benefits to be realized in the second half of 2023. The launch of Bonds for low-end markets and U.S. IQOS in 2024 is expected to further enhance Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)’s status as the ""best-in-class"" in the tobacco industry.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) was part of 47 hedge fund portfolios, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners held the largest stake in the company, comprising 24.25 million shares worth $2.45 billion. Like PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in.Broyhill Asset Management made the following comment about Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) advanced 11% for the twelve months ending December 2022. After scratching our heads for years, we have to confess to feeling a little bit of pleasure watching some of the previous nonsense get their just deserts. When we first disclosed our investment in Philip Morris, we highlighted the gap between the “haves” and the “have nots” using the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index, which had gained 140% in a few weeks, as an example. The top five stocks in this index generated $1.6B in sales in FY20 and traded at a combined $37.3B market capitalization or more than 23x sales. In contrast, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) at Philip Morris (PM) generated over $6.8B in FY20 sales, which was less than 20x PM’s then $135 billion market capitalization. So one could have bought the top five marijuana companies that burned a cumulative $1.2 billion in trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 23x sales or bought Phillip Morris’ RRPs for less than 20x sales and got over $9 billion in free cash flow generated by their traditional business for free! Since then, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index went on to shed ~ 85% of its value while PM returned ~ 55% over the same period.”10. Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), an American agribusiness and food company, is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to watch. On February 23, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.625 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on June 2, to shareholders of record on May 19. Effective from March 15, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) replaced Signature Bank (NASDAQ:SBNY) in the S&amp;P 500.On February 9, Baird analyst Ben Kallo downgraded Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $115, down from $127. The company topped consensus estimates but issued initial 2023 guidance below Street expectations, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 50 hedge funds were bullish on Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG), compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Jack Woodruff’s Candlestick Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.15 million shares worth $114.7 million. Here is what Old West Investment Management has to say about Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Bunge (pronounced BUN-GEE) Ltd (NYSE:BG) is one of the biggest agribusinesses and food companies in the world. There are four worldwide companies that dominate the sector, the others being Archer-Daniels-Midland Cargill, and Dreyfuss. One of our favorite ways to screen for new ideas is following insider buying. When I saw the Form 4 filed by new Bunge CEO Greg Heckman, his purchase of $9 million of BG stock intrigued me. My initial thought was the company gave him the stock as a signing bonus. I contacted BG Investor Relations and asked whether it was a signing bonus or did Heckman actually write a check for $9 million. IR assured me it was his own hard-earned money that he invested in the company he was about to run.Heckman was a long time executive at Conagra Foods who obviously sensed opportunity at BG. One of his first moves as CEO was to move the company’s HQ from New York to St. Louis, right in the middle of America’s breadbasket. BG had been plagued for years with poor decisions by underperforming management. Heckman’s decision to move to St. Louis was indicative of a no-nonsense style and he would commence cutting expenses and selling non-core assets…” (Click here to see the full text)9. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to invest in. On February 16, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) declared a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend, a 4.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.44. The dividend is payable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. In 2023, the company announced its 61st consecutive annual dividend increase, making it a reliable dividend king. On March 20, Deutsche Bank maintained a Hold rating on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) but reduced its price target on the shares from $63 to $60. The firm believes that there is a growing possibility of economic challenges ahead for the consumer staples industry. As a result, Deutsche Bank is becoming more worried about the potential risks to the company's future financial performance across much of its coverage.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 58 hedge funds were bullish on The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), compared to 59 funds in the prior quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in the company, with 400 million shares worth $25.4 billion. Rowan Street Capital mentioned The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Let’s take The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) for example. Its dividend yield is 2.8%, earnings are estimated to grow at only 3.6% rate per year over next 4 years, and its earnings multiple is currently at 24x (based on next years forecasted earnings). KO has an anemic growth, so we can argue that paying 24x earnings is not very attractive. Let’s assume that the multiple will stay constant over the next 3-5 years, thus our expected annual returns will be 2.8%+3.6% = 6.4% (that is below the current reported inflation rate and only slightly above the risk-free rate of 4%).”8. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) is one of the biggest American discount retailers. On March 16, the company reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.96, beating market estimates by $0.02. Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) also reiterated its plans to execute 3,170 real estate projects in fiscal 2023, including 1,050 new store openings, 2,000 remodels, and 120 store relocations. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to monitor. On March 17, Deutsche Bank increased its estimated price on Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) shares from $248 to $249 and maintained a Buy rating following the release of the company's Q4 results. According to the firm, it seems that the market underestimated the expected performance of the company in 2023, which is now anticipated to be more heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year. Additionally, Deutsche Bank suggests that the decrease in planned share buybacks may be due in part to higher levels of capital expenditures.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 59 hedge funds were long Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG), and Brandon Haley’s Holocene Advisors is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 788,664 shares worth $194.20 million. Here is what Aristotle Capital specifically said about Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Dollar General Corporation (NYSE:DG) contributed to performance in the second quarter following the report of first quarter earnings that were above expectations. Strength in the second quarter was driven by better-than-expected sales of consumable items. Guidance for the remainder of the year was increased. In addition to solid earnings, forecasts for the increasing expectations of a recession drove positive sentiment towards consumer discretionary companies with more predictable revenue like dollar stores.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale worldwide. On February 21, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) declared a $0.57 per share quarterly dividend, a 1.8% increase from its prior dividend of $0.56. The dividend is distributable on April 3, to shareholders of record on March 17. It is one of the best counter cyclical stocks to watch. According to Morgan Stanley's recent survey, Walmart+ has 18.4 million members, which is equivalent to 14.3% of U.S. households. This figure is slightly higher than the previous survey and almost the same as the record high of 18.6 million members in September 2022. The firm believes that there is still room for more growth in Walmart+ based on the actual number of members and the number of respondents who are very likely to join. Morgan Stanley recommends buying Walmart shares and reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $160 on March 7. Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 66 funds were long Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of Q4 2022, compared to 68 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 7 million shares worth $993.2 million.In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

The company is experiencing difficulties with its comp sales growth slowing down due to inflation and possible competitive pressures affecting its gross margins. Roth MKM informed investors in a research note that even though Costco is gaining market share and may increase its membership fees, the stock's value is still too high, considering the limited potential earnings upside in FY23.According to Insider Monkey’s fourth quarter database, 66 hedge funds were long Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), compared to 69 funds in the earlier quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 937,521 shares worth about $428 million. In addition to PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the top counter cyclical stocks to invest in. Madison Funds made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock fell after November sales results showed a slowing consumer. The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins.

Despite a slight moderation in inflation to 6.0% in February, individual household budgets are under pressure, consumer confidence is suffering, and the cost of living is increasing.Many consumers are putting financial limitations in place as a result of the growing cost of living. 47% of British consumers have already reduced or plan to reduce their overall spending as a result of inflation, according to data analytics company Kantar. 56% of American consumers, according to data by the information firm Morning Consult, are ready to shop less overall. Consumers are placing a higher value on staples over discretionary goods. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) are some of the top consumer staples stocks during the current inflationary environment. These companies have consistent pricing power and offer consumers goods that are required regardless of the state of the economy. This is good for the investors, but not so much for the consumers.The continuous supply chain crisis and the conflict in Russia and Ukraine are major contributors to the current high level of inflation, which is pushing up the cost of food, housing and energy prices. A typical household spends one-third of their income on housing. Housing costs have increased by 8%, roughly equal to the overall rate of inflation. Nonetheless, wages in the US climbed by 5.28% in December 2022 compared to the same month the year before. This suggests that the majority of people's largest expense is increasing faster than their income. Likewise, food costs increased by 9.9% in 2022. Almost 12% of household spending goes toward food, making it clear that this is an essential expense that is rising faster than salaries. The price of diesel fuel, which has increased significantly more than the price of gasoline, is a hidden factor in food inflation. Many of the equipment used to produce food and the trucks that transport them run on diesel. The additional expense is being passed on to consumers by the producers.Story continuesAll consumers, even retirees, are directly impacted by inflation in terms of their income, savings, and spending. For many people, the main concern about retirement is the cost of living. It is not unexpected that more people are choosing to retire abroad to cheap countries with a low cost of living, affordable healthcare, better weather, low taxes and a higher quality of life. Living overseas is a significant retirement ambition for 12% of Americans, according to the Aegon Retirement Readiness Survey 2021. But, while choosing a cheap country to relocate to, safety is also quite important.We have produced a list of the cheapest countries in the world, but it is pertinent to note that due to the level of political unrest in most of them, they are also among the most dangerous nations in the world. Therefore, they are extremely unsuitable for retirees to choose while thinking about moving abroad. Having said that, let’s move to the 25 cheapest countries in the world. You can also check out 25 Best Countries For A Comfortable Retirement and 15 Biggest Retirement Mistakes You Will Regret Forever.Our MethodologyFor our list of 25 cheapest countries in the world, we’ve defined a cheap country as one with a low cost of living. For this purpose, we looked at the Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index by Country 2023. Numbeo is a crowd-sourced global database of statistics related to the quality of life, including information on housing indicators, perceived crime rates, healthcare quality, and transportation quality. In order to ascertain the cheapest countries in the world, we only shortlisted countries which ranked in the lower two quintiles of the report. Following that, we cross-referenced the resultant list with Economist Impact’s Global Food Security Index 2022 and averaged out the rankings to determine an average score for each country. For example, since Nigeria ranks 24th in the Numbeo’s Cost of Living Index and 7th in the Global Food Security Index, its average score for the purpose of this article is 15.5. We repeated the procedure for every country, then based on the average score, we selected the top 25 countries and ranked them from lowest to highest.10 Stocks Jim Cramer Is RecommendingStephen Bures / Shutterstock.comCheapest Countries in the World25.

It could also decide to make it easier for drug companies to muscle competitors out of some market areas with broad patents that cover more ground.Market research consultant Global Market Insights said the monoclonal antibodies market, which includes big-selling treatments for cancer, high cholesterol, COVID-19 and many other conditions, was worth $181 billion in 2021.Under U.S. patent law, drug companies can get 20 years of market exclusivity for publishing their inventions, but must describe them clearly enough so skilled people can copy and use them without too much trial and error. Companies that describe inventions too broadly run the risk of having their patents canceled.Amgen, supported at the Supreme Court by AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb and GSK, wants the high court to rule that it can use “genus claims,” which describe a set of characteristics or features common to a group, to describe what Repatha does in broad language.If successful, Amgen would claim ownership of all antibodies that inhibit the PCSK9 protein, the mechanism of action for both Repatha and Praluent. Other companies could then do the same with their own antibody treatments in other disease areas.Story continuesSanofi and Regeneron, backed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Eli Lilly &lt; LLY.N&gt; and at least six other companies, have argued that broad patent protection like Amgen is seeking is not allowed by U.S. patent law.Patent lawyer Irena Royzman of Kramer Levin said the companies taking Sanofi and Regeneron’s side are doing so because a win would allow them to keep bringing competitive drugs to market more easily.“The J&amp;Js, Eli Lillys and Pfizers recognize that if a particular company controls an entire therapeutic target, we’re all the poorer for it,” Royzman said.The case might also affect newer technologies used in medicine, such as CRISPR gene editing and messenger RNA, she said.Amgen's side says if forced to only claim the structural components of their drugs in patents, competitors could easily design around them, disincentivizing investment in monoclonal antibodies.Baird analyst Brian Skorney said the immediate financial impact of the decision is limited to the companies involved, although it could give some an advantage in future litigation.Regeneron made $130 million from Praluent in the U.S. last year, and Sanofi collected $400 million in the rest of the world.U.S. courts have so far sided with Sanofi. A Washington, D.C.-based federal appeals court that covers U.S. patent cases invalidated Amgen's patent claiming ownership of all PCSK9 inhibitors as a whole in 2021.Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron in 2014. Both drugs use lab-made antibodies to block PCSK9 proteins that inhibit removal of bad LDL cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve that result through different chemical combinations.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove Editing by Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot)]"

Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen sold nearly $1.3 billion worth of Repatha worldwide in 2022. Meanwhile, Sanofi and Regeneron last year sold $530 million worth worldwide of their rival drug Praluent, which works by a similar mechanism as Repatha.Amgen has sought to patent a group of antibodies that help reduce so-called ""bad"" cholesterol, though its patents disclosed only a subset of antibodies it claimed. At issue is whether a valid patent can cover all the members of an identified group, or if it is limited to only those members of the group specified by the patent owner.Amgen's lawyer, Jeffrey Lamken, and Sanofi's attorney, Paul Clement, both said a ruling against the company they represent would hurt innovation. Lamken argued that companies would not invest in research if they cannot receive patents for what they invent.Clement urged the court not to squeeze out competition from the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs.Story continues""We're better off with two competing independently developed therapies,"" Clement said.Clement said allowing Amgen's broad patents would freeze out other companies.The justices focused their questions on trying to determine how many antibodies Amgen's patents actually covered, whether dozens, hundreds or even millions. Amgen has argued that a patent need only to ""enable skilled artisans to 'make and use' the invention,"" not account for the full range of possible forms the invention might take.Amgen faced tough questions about why its patents described 26 specific examples of antibodies when the scope of its patents would cover a larger number.""Several times you referred to invention of the antibodies, and I think I'm somewhat confused as to exactly what your invention is. You said it's not just the 26 but it definitely is not millions. So what is it exactly?"" conservative Justice Clarence Thomas asked Lamken. ""We're not talking about what has been invented with any particular precision.""Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wondered how the company has ""satisfied enablement"" by claiming a patent covering a large group of antibodies but focusing its patents on a smaller group.If the number claimed in a patent could reach the millions, Jackson asked Amgen's lawyer, ""You think that gives others enough notice as to what you've claimed?""Amgen sued Sanofi and Regeneron in 2014 for patent infringement over Praluent. Both drugs use laboratory-made antibodies to block a protein called PCSK9 that inhibits the removal of bad cholesterol from the blood, but they achieve this result through different chemical combinations.Bad cholesterol, known LDL, can cause a buildup of plaque in blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears all patent appeals nationwide, invalidated Amgen's patents that covered PCSK9-blocking drugs as a group.President Joe Biden's administration, arguing in support of Sanofi, told the justices that Amgen had not disclosed the information needed to make to make its patents valid.A ruling in the case is expected by the end of June.(Reporting by John Kruzel and Andrew Chung, with additional reporting by Blake Brittain; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Sanofi SNY, Regeneron REGN, AbbVie ABBV, Roche RHHBY and Eli Lilly LLY.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Pharma Stock Roundup: Meeting Goals, Receiving CRLsThis week, Sanofi and partner Regeneron’s blockbuster medicine, Dupixent succeeded in a pivotal study for yet another new indication, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The FDA declined to approve AbbVie’s Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy, ABBV-951.Roche entered into a deal with Eli Lilly for the development of its blood test for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSanofi’s Dupixent Meets Primary Endpoint in COPD study: The pivotal phase III study, BOREAS, which evaluated Sanofi/Regeneron’s Dupixent for treating COPD, met both its primary and secondary endpoints. Data from the BOREAS study demonstrated that Dupixent led to a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction (30%) in exacerbations compared to placebo. In fact, treatment with the drug also led to significant improvement in lung function, quality of life and respiratory symptoms.Dupixent is currently approved in the United States and EU for five type II inflammatory diseases, namely severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, severe asthma, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis. The promising data from the COPD study opens up a new avenue for growth for this already highly successful medicine.Sanofi and Regeneron are also evaluating Dupixent in the COPD indication in an ongoing second replicate phase III study (NOTUS). Data from the same is expected next year, following which the companies plan to file for approval.Story continuesThe European Commission approved Dupixent for treating children six months to five years of age with severe atopic dermatitis, also called eczema, who are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent was approved by the FDA for atopic dermatitis in children in this age group in June 2022. In Europe, approximately 80,000 infants and young children have uncontrolled severe atopic dermatitis, which signifies the drug’s significant unmet need for kids under 5 years.FDA Gives CRL to AbbVie NDA for Parkinson’s Candidate: The FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) to AbbVie’s new drug application (“NDA”) seeking approval for ABBV-951 for the treatment of motor fluctuations in patients with advanced PD. ABBV-951 is a solution of carbidopa and levodopa prodrugs, which are the standard of care for PD patients. ABBV-951 has been designed to offer continuous subcutaneous delivery of CD/LD prodrugs through a pump device and offer a better patient experience. In the CRL, the FDA has asked for some extra information about the pump device used to administer the medicine. The FDA has not requested any additional efficacy/safety studies.AbbVie’s phase II study evaluating Rinvoq (upadacitinib) for patients with moderately to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) met the primary endpoint in the 30 mg group. The primary endpoint of the study was achieving SLE Responder Index (SRI-4) with a steroid dose less than or equal to 10 mg prednisone equivalent once daily at week 24. Based on the phase II positive data, AbbVie is advancing upadacitinib to phase III development for SLE.AbbVie also announced positive data from a phase III induction study evaluating Skyrizi (risankizumab) to treat moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The data showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients, 20.3% treated with risankizumab achieved the primary endpoint of clinical remission compared to 6.2% of patients on placebo at week 12. The study also met all secondary endpoints, including clinical, endoscopic and histologic outcomes. Skyrizi is presently approved for Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.Roche &amp; Lilly’s Alzheimer’s Collaboration: Roche announced a collaboration with Lilly for the development of Elecsys Amyloid Plasma Panel (EAPP), its blood test for earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The FDA had granted Breakthrough Device Designation to EAPP in July last year. Lilly has donanemab and remternetug in its Alzheimer’s pipeline. In January, the FDA issued a CRL to Lilly’s biologics license application for donanemab for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.8% in the last five trading sessions.In the last five trading sessions, AstraZeneca rose the most (1.9%), while Merck declined the most (2.9%).In the past six months, AstraZeneca has risen the most (26.9%), while Roche has declined the most (9.5%).(See the last pharma stock roundup here: M&amp;A Boom in Drug Industry With PFE &amp; SNY Deals, Other Updates)Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. In that time, it is up 42%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 61%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 32% drop, in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Union Pacific actually saw its EPS drop 3.1% per year.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the decline in earnings per share is not representative of how the business has changed over the years. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movements.We are not particularly impressed by the annual compound revenue growth of 0.9% over five years. So it seems one might have to take closer look at earnings and revenue trends to see how they might influence the share price.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthUnion Pacific is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. If you are thinking of buying or selling Union Pacific stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst consensus estimates for future profits.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Union Pacific, it has a TSR of 58% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 13% in the twelve months, Union Pacific shareholders did even worse, losing 30% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 10% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Union Pacific better, we need to consider many other factors.

Read the prospectus carefully before investing.Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. Value securities may be unprofitable if the market fails to recognize their intrinsic worth or the portfolio manager misgauged that worth. Investments in a limited number of companies subject the fund to greater risk of loss. The fund may invest significantly in issuers within a particular sector, which may be negatively affected by market, economic or other conditions, making the fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in the sector. There are risks associated with fixed-income investments, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer term securities. Foreign investments subject the fund to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Income from tax-exempt municipal bonds or municipal bond funds may be subject to state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the federal and/or state alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Federal and state income tax rules will apply to any capital gains.

At Cisco Networking Academy, our mission aligns with the company's purpose of powering an inclusive future for all.NOTE: View the Cisco video here on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-y33Mfp4BcSince its inception 25 years ago, the cumulative number of women participating in Cisco Networking Academy ​​​​​​​(calculated as a percent of the total number of students who identified their gender as male, female, or nonbinary) has grown over time, and now stands at 26 percent.Still, we can do more, especially as women comprise nearly half of the workforce.The reasons why women are underrepresented in technology may be multifaceted. Whether it is because of cultural norms or gender stereotypes-the fact is that technology touches every aspect of our lives. If women aren't better represented in technology as all industries digitize, we are missing their contributions and innovations.Positive role-models may help, and for that we don't need to look further than some of Networking Academy's own alumni.In educationIn education, people like Nancy not only achieved academically for themselves but realized they could help others, too. ""The skills I received during my time at a Cisco Networking Academy changed my life course forever,"" says Nancy. ""I am a first-generation college student and found my passion of teaching through being a student of the Networking Academy. I started my career in the IT industry implementing and supporting networks all over the United States.""""After attending Networking Academy courses, I knew I wanted to be a college professor and make a difference in the lives of others. I have been teaching Cisco Networking Academy courses for over 22 years and have touched the lives of thousands of students and I am forever grateful for this opportunity.""Story continuesIn India, Matilda has a similar story to tell. ""In 2004, networking courses were highly sought after. It was during this time that I graduated as an instructor for a CCNA course and established a local Networking Academy in IFET College of Engineering, Tamil Nadu,"" she says. Now a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Matilda has continued to help students gain real-world tech skills that have also led to fulfilling careers.Empowering underserved communitiesOther women use the opportunity to help underserved communities.Lawanda, from Oklahoma, says Networking Academy gave her confidence and opportunities that she never had before. ""I used to think only highly intelligent people could work or understand IT and now I'm doing this work,"" she says. As an Indigenous American, Lawanda is now, ""looking forward to working within the Indian Health Services as a System Network Technician while still serving Indigenous communities to give back to my people, as I'd always dreamed of doing.""Kutlwano, from South Africa has a similar story of empowerment to tell. ""I have learnt to be fearless as a woman in IT firstly, and to believe that I can be whatever I want and achieve it all,"" she says.""Since 2015, I went from being a Desktop Support Technician, to an IT Administrator, SOC Analyst, Network and Systems Engineer, and now in Risk and Compliance. Networking Academy and TCM Academy was my starting point and opened all those doors for me. This is only the beginning, there's still more to explore and achieve.""""My success story also has made other girls and young women see that they too can achieve all they set their mind to and that's all it takes, changing the world by inspiring and giving hope to more women in IT and to continue being fearless.""As technology touches every aspect of life, we need to see more inspiring stories like this from women in tech and related fields. According to a report by UNESCO, ""women remain a minority in digital information technology, computing, physics, mathematics and engineering, the very fields that are driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution and, thus, many of the jobs of tomorrow.""The tech-driven Fourth Industrial Revolution could be ""a complement to the best parts of human nature-creativity, empathy, stewardship-it can also lift humanity into a new collective and moral consciousness based on a shared sense of destiny,"" according to Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum. And the world needs women to lead and help shape that future.What actions can we take now?On April 27, we will celebrate Girls in ICT Day, with the theme of ""Digital Skills for Life."" Our Cisco Women Rock-IT program will host a range of inspiring speakers who are using tech to help address something important in all of our lives-climate change.Cisco hosts events through our Women Rock-IT program, which began in 2014 and has seen more than two million participants with over half enrolling in one of our Cisco Networking Academy courses. Cisco employees also volunteer to support events on Girls in ICT Day in Cisco offices, and on-campus at local schools, colleges, and universities.Our panelists will discuss their work and inspirations in globally-broadcast sessions over four different time zones. Whether you are already a fearless woman in IT, or at the beginning of your education journey, I'm certain you'll find inspiration in these women's stories.Do you know a high school, college, university, or organization that might like to host an event? Share this form with them to register schools now!And save the date to encourage young people in your life to tune-in. Registrations for the virtual event open March 24 and free courses will be offered to attendees over the age of 14.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/746190/Cisco-Women-Use-Technology-to-Solve-the-Issues-Facing-HumanityAnd-the-World-Needs-More]"
