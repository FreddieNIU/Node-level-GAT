By comparing the survey results to Capstone's annual Middle Market (MM) Business Owners Survey, the report seeks to identify and elevate key differences and challenges that female founders face."", ""Women entrepreneurs' current growth strategies have largely included organic initiatives, with more than half increasing market penetration (59%) and expanding product or service portfolios (53.8%). Of note, market penetration tactics have been more pertinent to women CEOs compared to the broader MM business owner audience, of which only 47.5% have increased market penetration."", ""Regarding current growth strategies, only 18.1% of women entrepreneurs have enacted inorganic initiatives through M&A. However, M&A as an exit strategy is likely to be more prevalent, with 36.7% considering a merger or acquisition. This is especially true for women CEOs aged 18-34, as many plan to participate in multiple business ventures throughout their careers. Among female CEOs in this age group, 48% have considered M&A as an exit strategy compared to 33.6% of 35 to 54-year-olds and 17.9% of 55+ year-olds. Elevated private equity interest in businesses owned by Gen Z founders may have also contributed to 18 to 34-year-olds' M&A exit considerations. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of women CEOs ages 18-34 have been contacted by a sponsor looking to buy their company."", 'According to our results, women entrepreneurs are more prepared for an exit than they perceive. When prompted directly, 43.3% of female CEOs noted they have started to plan a business exit. However, when provided a list of exit preparation steps, 74.8% identified that they have completed at least one step. Many women entrepreneurs have built a strong executive leadership team (37.1%), determined financial needs (34.3%), and maximized growth strategies (31.9%) in 2023 to prepare for a future exit.', ""When it came to top concerns for the future growth of their company, inflation headlined the chart, comprising 55% of responses. Customer retention was the next highest concern at 35%. These figures mirrored the top two concerns in Capstone's MM Business Owner Survey. At the same time, increased workload or stress appeared third on female founders' list compared to seventh for overall MM business owners. Funding for growth and credit availability were also more heavily weighted."", ""Nearly one in four respondents to Capstone's WE Survey indicated that they required help raising debt and equity capital. The absence of growth funds allocated to female founders and the lack of sizeable loans approved for women-owned businesses are known hurdles for women entrepreneurs seeking to expand their business operations. Access to early-stage, or venture capital (VC), funding has been historically low for women, with incremental gains over the past 15 years. In 2008, 3.4% of VC deals went to female-founded companies compared to 6.1% in 2023, according to PitchBook. In addition to limited deal volume for female founders, the average deal size remains far below those awarded to male counterparts.

While investors shouldn't expect multibagger returns, these companies are ideal for those who prefer a slow and steady approach to long-term investing. "", ""With a low valuation and consistent profits, MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) fits the bill. Let's explore why it could have a place in your investment portfolio. "", ""Anyone who has been to Las Vegas should be familiar with MGM Resorts. The casino operator is known for its iconic properties like the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, and its namesake, the MGM Grand. The company also has a footprint in America's regional casino markets and the Chinese market via that nation's famed gaming hub, Macau. "", 'Like many in-person entertainment companies, MGM was hit hard by the pandemic at the start of the decade. However, it managed to navigate this challenging time without destroying its balance sheet because of the well-timed $4.25 billion leaseback sale of the Bellagio in 2019. ', ""Leaseback sales involve selling a casino's real estate assets to a third party in return for cash while renting it back to use for operations. The Bellagio deal gave MGM the extra cash it needed to deal with the pandemic without over-relying on debt financing or selling new stock. In 2021, management completed an additional $3.89 billion leaseback sale of its Aria and Vdara properties to free up more capital to pursue new growth opportunities. "", ""These moves highlight MGM's transition to a more nimble, asset-light business model and its commitment to source capital without potentially shareholder-unfriendly tactics like debt issuance or equity dilution, which can reduce investors' claims on future earnings. "", ""MGM Resorts is a mature blue chip company, so investors shouldn't expect breakneck growth. That said, its recent performance looks encouraging. Net revenue increased by 13% year over year to $4.4 billion, mainly because of the strength in MGM China, which is still recovering from the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions in Macau. Over the next five years, the company will enjoy some potentially transformational growth drivers."", ""MGM is partnering with the financial services company Orix Corporation to build a new $10 billion integrated resort in Osaka, Japan. Despite being a large, wealthy economy, Japan's gambling industry is virtually untapped, as most casino games were banned until 2018. Industry watchers believe the Osaka resort could generate a whopping $3.9 billion in annual revenue when fully operational in the mid-2030s. "", 'To put these numbers in context, MGM generated sales of around $16.2 billion in the full year of 2023. So, the Japanese resort could represent a substantial boost to its top-line growth over the long term while providing much-needed diversification outside of the U.S. and China.', 'With a solid and steadily growing top line, MGM Resort is an attractive investment. But its rock-bottom valuation is icing on the cake. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 19, which is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average of 27. ', ""And while the company doesn't pay a dividend, management returns value to investors via a generous buyback program that has reduced shares outstanding by a whopping 36% since 2021. Investors generally like buybacks because they can increase investors' claims on future earnings and cash flow by reducing the number of shares outstanding."", 'Before you buy stock in MGM Resorts International, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MGM Resorts International wasn’t one of them.

Designers require electronic components that meet stringent radiation and reliability standards to operate in the harsh environments found in space. Microchip Technology (Nasdaq: MCHP) today announces the SAMD21RT, a radiation-tolerant (RT) Arm® Cortex®-M0+ based 32-bit microcontroller (MCU) in a 64-pin ceramic and plastic package with 128 KB Flash and 16 KB SRAM.', 'Designed for space-constrained applications where size and weight are of critical importance, the SAMD21RT is available in a small footprint of 10 mm × 10 mm.

We also continue to provide higher computing performance and integration of newer technologies into smaller packages, reducing weight and size.”', 'The low-power SAMD21RT features idle and standby sleep modes and sleepwalking peripherals. Other peripherals include a 12-channel Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC), a 12-channel event system, various Timer/Counters for Control (TCC), a 32-bit Real Time Counter (RTC), a Watchdog Timer (WDT) and a USB 2.0 interface. Communication options include Serial Communication (SERCOM), I2C, SPI and LIN.', 'With tens of thousands of parts in orbit, Microchip has been a significant part of space exploration history and is critical to the missions of today and tomorrow.

Calendar-year S&P 500 per-share earnings are now seen near $244, actually rising in recent weeks, bucking the normal trend of declining earnings per share forecasts during a given year."", 'Continued decent consumer spending, heavy corporate capital expenditure trends (thank you, artificial intelligence) and beefy profit margins all contribute to an environment conducive to both resilient economic output and record company profits.

(Alas, we are merely data analysts and researchers!) But things are fine on that front, too, as the unemployment rate in the U.S. remains not far from multidecade lows while the inflation trajectory is generally heading in the right direction. There are even better consumer price trends in overseas markets with the potential for rate cuts sooner rather than later in some developed ex-U.S. economies.[3]"", 'In terms of the markets, equities seemed to have gotten through a dose of April malaise.

More than 240 Salesforce alumni were hired at ServiceNow in the last year, and over 820 in the last five years, the data show.', 'ServiceNow initially focused on tools to support information technology operations, but has moved into categories like customer service, bringing it into more direct competition with Salesforce, the top maker of customer management software. In the most-recent fiscal year, ServiceNow’s total product revenue of $8.97 billion passed that of Salesforce’s comparable product line, Service Cloud, which generated $8.25 billion.', 'ServiceNow’s stock has jumped fourfold since the start of 2019 — pushing the company’s market value to almost $155 billion, compared with Salesforce’s $277 billion.', 'It’s not just rank-and-file workers switching over at the San Francisco Bay area companies — ServiceNow has poached senior leadership, including those who have helped define Salesforce’s unique corporate personality.', 'Colin Fleming, who shaped Salesforce’s marketing through high-profile deals with Matthew McConaughey and the estate of Albert Einstein, earlier this month became ServiceNow’s chief marketing officer. Along with his hiring, the company announced an ad campaign with actor Idris Elba. Amy Regan Morehouse, who built Salesforce’s Trailhead user education program, was hired at ServiceNow last year to build a similar training ecosystem.', 'The executive who used to run Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference, Debbie Brewer, joined ServiceNow in 2022, according to her LinkedIn listing. Even former Salesforce Co-Chief Executive Officer Keith Block has partnered with ServiceNow through his venture firm, Smith Point Capital.', '“We’re a very aspirational company that a lot of people want to pull talent from,” said Bill Patterson, executive vice president of corporate strategy at San Francisco-based Salesforce, in an interview. “If other people make moves to come into our domain, it’s quite flattering honestly that they want to aspire to be more like us.”', 'ServiceNow, based in Santa Clara, California, has taken an increasingly aggressive tone toward its larger software peer. During an analyst event last year, Chief Executive Officer Bill McDermott bragged about hiring top AI and product talent from Salesforce. He’s also taken thinly veiled swipes at Salesforce’s lower margins and large acquisitions, saying they lead to technical difficulty for customers.', 'Of course, McDermott’s tenure as CEO at German-software company SAP SE was marked by large acquisitions, such as an $8 billion deal for Qualtrics International Inc., which weren’t always popular with investors. In 2016, Salesforce considered acquiring ServiceNow, according to leaked emails.', 'When Salesforce purchased workplace communication app Slack in 2021, ServiceNow switched to Microsoft Corp.’s Teams. The change was tied to an expanding relationship with Microsoft as well as the ownership transition, a spokesperson said.', 'Salesforce’s Patterson downplayed any competition, saying that when companies try using ServiceNow for customer service management, “they don’t do well for long,” due to a lack of capabilities.', 'Disproportionate hiring from Salesforce could signal ServiceNow is trying to bulk up its ability to sell software beyond IT departments, said Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. ServiceNow also may just be the flashier company now, he said. “Clearly the growth and excitement around Salesforce is a lot different than it was several years ago — you’ve seen a lot of people leave.”', 'The flow of employees to ServiceNow also reflects retrenchment in the rest of the industry. Like many other large tech companies, Salesforce announced in early 2023 that it would lay off thousands of workers. It cut 6,700 employees last year to about 72,700 as of the end of January. McDermott, by contrast, has vowed to avoid widespread job cuts and has increased the company’s headcount about 2,300 in the past year to more than 23,300, as of the end of March.', 'About half of the workers who’ve joined ServiceNow from Salesforce over the last five years were in sales and marketing, according to the figures from Live Data Technologies. Roughly 30% were in product and engineering.', '“We’re grateful that more than 1 million people applied to ServiceNow last year, and that we have the culture and success to attract a world-class team,” Sarah Tilley, senior vice president of talent at ServiceNow, said in a statement.', 'More than 2 million people applied for jobs at Salesforce last year, said a company spokesperson.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Google’s Moonshot Factory Falls Back Down to Earth', 'Netflix Had a Password-Sharing Problem.

Exciting new products built from generative AI models are just beginning to come to market and will continue to change the way we interact with technology.', 'Just this week there were two significant releases from both Microsoft’s, OpenAI and Alphabet.', 'Additionally, now that broad markets have traded sideways for the better part of two months, energy has been built for a major breakout in the leading names. These product releases should be a valuable catalyst for the next big rally.', 'OpenAI introduced the newest iteration of their primary AI model, GPT-4o. The demonstrations of GPT-4o were extremely impressive, with one video showing the AI model interacting with and tutoring a young boy on his math homework.', 'The GPT, young boy and father were all in conversation with each other, and the GPT helped him through the process in a supportive and logical way. It was really something, and I recommend those interested seek out some of the most recent demonstrations released online.', 'Then, at Google I/O, Alphabet’s annual developer conference, the company introduced its newest AI enabled “Agents,” built throughout its platforms. This product is built on Gemini, Alphabet’s response to OpenAI’s GPT.', 'In one demo, the presenter wanted to return a pair of shoes they bought online. They took a picture of them, and said to the agent, “I want to return these shoes, they don’t fit.” Gemini proceeded to find the order info in Gmail, fill out a return form, and scheduled a pickup from UPS. It really functioned like a personal assistant.', 'The presentation also showed Gemini agents planning detailed trips catered to specific interests, summarizing long email chains, and working across multiple external websites to really simplify workflow.', 'Again, I recommend those interested go watch the demo videos.', ""For this next bull run in AI stocks, my favorite player is Alphabet. Many analysts and commentators have been very loud about how Google is playing catch up in AI, or that GPTs are going to disrupt Google's search engine."", 'They have forgotten just how deeply entrenched Alphabet’s products are in daily life. Alphabet has nine products with more than 1 billion users along with the epic amounts of data and engineers to implement the new technology.', 'Furthermore, Alphabet enjoys both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, and a compelling technical trading setup.', 'GOOGL stock just broke out from a bull flag and looks ready to make new YTD highs.', 'Alphabet also has a very reasonable valuation, trading at 22.5x forward earnings, which is in line with the market average and below its 10-year median of 26.2x.', 'My next AI stock recommendation is not very original. Nvidia, has been and is the name to own for the trend in AI. The company is simply years ahead of other semiconductor producers, and its data center chips remain the key piece of infrastructure for technology being built with generative AI.', 'Nvidia also jumped back onto the Zacks Rank this morning with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates, with FY25 increasing by 7% in the last two months.', 'And even with all the talk of Nvidia being wildly overpriced, the stock remains reasonably valued thanks to the massive growth of sales and earnings. Today, Nvidia is trading at 40x forward earnings, just below the industry average and its 10-year median.', 'EPS are also forecast to grow at an incredible 30% annually over the next 3-5 years.', 'NVDA stock, like GOOGL, also just broke out from a clean bull flag. As the leading name in AI, I would expect Nvidia to run to new highs in no time.', 'My final AI stock pick for the next leg higher is Arista Networks. Lesser known than the other two tech giants shared, Arista Networks is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions for large data centers. The company specializes in designing and delivering high-performance network switches and software-defined networking (SDN) solutions that offer scalability, reliability, and programmability.', 'Arista Networks plays a crucial role in providing the networking infrastructure necessary to support AI workloads and applications. As AI models become increasingly complex and data-intensive, they require robust and high-speed network connections to transfer data between servers, storage systems, and other components of the AI infrastructure.', 'The Artificial Intelligence boom has been and will continue to be a major boon to Arista’s core business.', 'Like the others, ANET also has a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflected by strongly upward trending earnings revisions.', 'Arista Networks stock has actually shown relative strength during the recent selloff, and over the last two and a half months it has gained more than both Nvidia and Alphabet. Because I am a fan of momentum, I consider this relative strength to be very bullish, especially in this AI context.', 'Don’t sleep on the AI boom, because we are still early days. Keen investors will continue to be given opportunities to profit from this new technology, so keep your ears to the ground, focus on stocks with top Zacks Ranks, and be a prudent risk manager.', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

It shows why ServiceNow is the gold standard in the digital workflow market. Most of ServiceNow's biggest deals in the quarter were for generative AI products."", ""Importantly, subscription-based businesses make for solid long-term investments because of their recurring revenue streams and high margins. This explains why analysts expect the company's earnings per share to grow faster than revenue at an annualized rate of 29% in the coming years. That is enough growth to potentially double your investment in five years or so, even if investors are paying a lower price-to-earnings multiple for the stock down the road, which is currently steep at 77 times trailing earnings."", ""AI will have a lasting impact on the economy, and nowhere will that be more evident than how people shop and find information online. This is why investors are increasingly looking at Alphabet as a major beneficiary of this revolutionary technology. Google has been investing in AI for many years, and it's starting to pay off."", 'Revenue and earnings grew 15% and 61% year over year in the first quarter. The company is delivering these impressive results while investing in its Gemini AI model to bring smarter search results and other features to billions of users that rely on Google products.', ""It's also seeing strong demand for AI services from enterprise customers in Google Cloud, which is turning into a profitable revenue source for Alphabet. Google Cloud hauled in $900 million of operating profit last quarter. That is up from just $191 million in the year-ago quarter. The company says its new AI models and algorithms are more than 100 times more efficient than they were just 18 months ago."", 'The stock has soared to new highs this year, but still trades at a reasonable valuation.

When stocks in this broad index go on sale, it could be a prime time for investors to consider investing in them. Three S&P 500 stocks that have been crashing this year are attracting the notice of bargain hunters: Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA), Boeing (NYSE: BA), and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). ', ""Let's take a look at why these three S&P 500 stocks are struggling and whether you should consider adding them to your portfolio today."", ""Pharmacy retailer Walgreens hasn't been a bad investment for just this year; over the past five years, the stock has lost two-thirds of its value. There are plenty of reasons to be bearish on the stock. Not only has it struggled to grow, but the company's razor-thin margins make it difficult to turn a profit. While it has been diversifying into healthcare with the launch of primary care clinics through its investment in VillageMD, that may only put greater strain on the business and its resources in the future."", 'Earlier this year, the company slashed its dividend in an effort to strengthen its financial position. The company is also rumored to be looking at selling off assets, including its Boots U.K. pharmacies.', ""In the trailing 12 months, the healthcare company has incurred an operating loss of more than $2 billion. And with plenty of challenges ahead, this is a stock that I would steer clear of as things can still get much worse for Walgreens, and there's no guarantee they will get better."", 'Boeing has had a nearly identical decline to Walgreens this year. The reasons for its struggles also go back multiple years. Its planes have been plagued with safety concerns. In 2019, the Boeing 737 Max was temporarily grounded after it was involved in multiple fatal crashes, and there were reports of issues with engines, wiring, and the flight control computer. Earlier this year, the company made headlines again after a door flew off during a flight. It was later discovered that bolts meant to hold the door in place were missing. ', ""The big issue with the company is trust. Trust that it can deliver quality planes which airlines and passengers can rely on. Changes are coming to the management with CEO Dave Calhoun stepping down this year. If the company makes significant improvements to its quality control, then there's hope that the business may regain the trust of all its stakeholders, including investors."", ""In the meantime, the business's financials are underwhelming, to say the least. In three of the past four quarters, Boeing has incurred an operating loss. Revenue for the first three months of 2024 declined by 8% to $16.6 billion. "", 'The company faces a tough road ahead, and with a potential slowdown in travel demand amid a recession, there are plenty of reasons why things could still get worse for Boeing. Investors may be better off taking a wait-and-see approach with the stock as the risk surrounding Boeing makes it a bit too risky to invest in the business just yet. ', 'The S&P 500\'s worst-performing stock thus far is Intel, as shares of the chipmaker are down 38% this year. The tech company is positioning itself as a big player in next-gen chipmaking, but that isn\'t enough to win over investors. CEO Pat Gelsinger says, ""We are one of two, maybe three, companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies.""', ""The problem is that generating those chips may not be easy, despite what should be strong long-run demand. For the period ending March 30, Intel's foundry revenue declined by 10% year over year to $4.4 billion. And that area of its business also incurred a loss of $2.5 billion. "", ""Investors appear to doubt the tech company's ability to be a serious player in next-gen chips, given its underwhelming financials. But of the three stocks listed here, Intel may be the more intriguing contrarian play due to the need for the U.S. to reduce its dependence on foreign chipmakers. The U.S. government has agreed to give Intel up to $8.5 billion in grants to help increase chip production in the country, plus another $11 billion in loans."", ""Although Intel faces an uphill battle and it's still a risky buy right now, it could make for a good contrarian pick given the support it has from the government and the need for domestic chipmaking capabilities."", 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn’t one of them.

Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) had an absolutely terrific quarter, while Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) was down in the dumps."", ""But there is so much more to a company than one quarter's worth of earnings. When you put it all together, how do these two coffee shop chains stack up against each other? Let's find out."", 'Starbucks is the largest coffee chain in the world with nearly 39,000 stores, and if its expansion plans play out, it could become the largest restaurant chain in the world over the next few years.', 'It has incredible brand and pricing power, a proven track record, and a demonstrated model for getting new stores up and running quickly and profitably.', 'The fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended March 31) was unusually awful for the coffee king. Revenue decreased 2% from last year, and comparable sales (comps) were down 4%. Operating margin narrowed by 1.5 points to 12.8%, and earnings per share (EPS) were down 14% from last year to $0.68.', ""Even worse, it's facing challenges that you can't simply chalk up to inflation. It's already more expensive than most of its competition, including Dutch Bros and Luckin Coffee in China, which limits its ability to keep raising prices without turning away customers. It's also losing ground to Luckin, which has nearly 18,600 stores as of the end of the first quarter, as compared with Starbucks' almost 7,100 stores in the region. And it's still in the process of becoming a more digital-first company with smaller, more agile stores that can meet today's to-go environment."", 'Starbucks launched a reinvention strategy almost two years ago, and two years should be enough time to demonstrate progress. At the same time, with inflation, it makes sense that things get worse before they get better. The new plan addresses some of its problems, particularly the question of how it will change into a mobile and delivery center with speed and agility. Starbucks has successfully reinvented itself before, and it has no match globally.', ""Starbucks stock is down 28% over the past year, seriously underperforming the S&P 500 index. It's trading at a cheap price-to-earnings ratio of 21, and it pays a dividend that yields 2.9%, more than double the S&P 500."", ""Even though Dutch Bros' concept and beverages aren't all that different from Starbucks', it offers a different draw for investors."", ""It operates only 876 stores as of the end of the first quarter, a minuscule percentage of Starbucks' count. It's been opening around 40 stores per quarter, which is slower than Starbucks but higher as an overall percentage of its count. That's leading to high sales growth. It's doing an excellent job of staying efficient and demonstrating profitability at scale, so while it's not yet sustainably profitable, it's heading in that direction."", ""In stark contrast to Starbucks, it reported excellent first-quarter results. Sales increased 39% year over year, and comps growth made a big comeback at 10%. This has been one of the main red flags for investors, so it's a welcome update. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) jumped from $24 million to $53 million, and it swung to positive net income of $16 million after a $9 million loss last year."", 'There are many factors working together toward this success. Customers really like its stores, which are focused on speed and a friendly and fun atmosphere. Beverages are customized and innovative, and ""broistas"" walk through drive-thrus for faster, personal service.', ""Dutch Bros is based in Oregon and has a heavy presence in California, but it's been expanding across the country. It sees the opportunity to reach about 4,000 stores over the next few years. While still a drop in the bucket compared with Starbucks, that's more than quadruple today's store count. That's not a growth goal Starbucks can reasonably achieve."", ""The question of which stock is a better buy often boils down to what kind of stock you're looking for. If you're looking for an established leader with reliable and growing passive income, Starbucks is your stock. It's trading at a low price, making now an especially good time to buy in, and it's likely to rebound and create shareholder value."", 'If you have some risk tolerance and are looking for a growth stock, you would want to choose Dutch Bros.', ""I would point out that valuation isn't an exact science, because no two stocks are exactly the same, which makes comparisons tricky. So while Dutch Bros trades at a high forward one-year price-to-earnings ratio of 72 vs. 18 for Starbucks, they trade at the same price-to-sales ratio, even though Dutch Bros is growing sales much faster. That makes it look like a bargain today."", ""I see the risk for Dutch Bros as low right now. It's demonstrating that it can reach high comps growth and profits, and its model is working across regions. So I would choose Dutch Bros."", 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

Although the S&P 500 has historically grown from May to October, it has only increased by 2% compared to 7% from November to April.

Well, with interest rates remaining elevated, investors continue to shift their focus towards higher-yielding fixed-income investments such as T-bills due to their improved risk-to-reward ratios.

But the energy drink market is forecast to grow by 1.4% annually over the same period. This presents a big opportunity for investors.', 'Red Bull is not included among the energy drink stocks listed in this article because it is a private company. We instead focus on three appealing publicly traded stocks with exposure to the high-growth energy drink category.', 'Rising health consciousness among Millennials and Gen Z has fueled demand for fortified energy drinks.

The first-quarter earnings season has been strong. With 92% of S&P 500 companies reporting, the earnings per share beat rate is 78%, near the five-year average. More impressive is the updated first-quarter year-over-year earnings growth rate, which, according to FactSet, now stands at 5.40%, significantly above the 3.40% figure from the end of March.[1] What's more, year-over-year earnings growth estimates for the second quarter have ticked up, from 9% on March 31 to 9.60% as of May 3. Calendar-year S&P 500 per-share earnings are now seen near $244, actually rising in recent weeks, bucking the normal trend of declining earnings per share forecasts during a given year."", 'Continued decent consumer spending, heavy corporate capital expenditure trends (thank you, artificial intelligence) and beefy profit margins all contribute to an environment conducive to both resilient economic output and record company profits. And though the first-quarter U.S. GDP print came in lower than expected, mainly due to weak net export activity and a decline in business inventory, early signs point to an acceleration in the economic expansion rate this quarter.[2]', ""So, despite some dire predictions of tepid U.S. real GDP growth in 2024, particularly during the middle of the year, it appears to be a pretty good time if you're a CEO at a multinational corporation. (Alas, we are merely data analysts and researchers!) But things are fine on that front, too, as the unemployment rate in the U.S. remains not far from multidecade lows while the inflation trajectory is generally heading in the right direction. There are even better consumer price trends in overseas markets with the potential for rate cuts sooner rather than later in some developed ex-U.S. economies.[3]"", 'In terms of the markets, equities seemed to have gotten through a dose of April malaise.

There are clearly some macro tailwinds at play, but investors surely know that volatility can lurk right around the corner. There was a similar feeling of optimism early last summer before a 10% correction reset the playing field before year-end.', 'With the bulk of first-quarter earnings reports in the bag, the focus shifts to reading between the lines at corporate conferences.

The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.', 'Netflix is rebuilding the cable bundle, sans one important ingredient: news.', 'The company, having blown up the decades-old linear television business and ushered in the costly and destabilizing era of streaming, is inching closer and closer to resembling the entertainment behemoths of yesteryear.', 'Netflix has added advertisements to its plans, a move it initially resisted for several years, touting more than 40 million monthly active users on its ad-supported tier on Wednesday. It has added live late-night comedy, most recently with the roast of Tom Brady and John Mulaney’s “Everybody’s In L.A.” And it has made great strides into the live-sports arena, despite public statements asserting it does not wish to wade far into such waters.', 'On Wednesday, the streaming giant announced that it had struck a groundbreaking deal with the NFL to broadcast not one, but two games on Christmas Day this year. Those games add to the company’s ever-growing portfolio of live-sports offerings, including WWE “Raw,” which will air exclusively on the platform starting next year.', '“Last year, we decided to take a big bet on live — tapping into massive fandoms across comedy, reality TV, sports and more,” Bela Bajaria, Netflix chief content officer, said in a statement explaining the decision.', 'Notably absent from Bajaria’s statement and the company’s programming strategy, however, is news. Netflix has shown little-to-no interest in investing in either live-news or pre-taped programming (a la, a show akin to “Vice News Tonight” or “60 Minutes”). To date, it has neither publicly discussed nor launched any such projects. And in conversations with talent agents, it has made clear that the streamer has no interest in even dabbling in the news business.', '“The entertainment platforms are not interested in news,” one talent agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told me. “Their audiences don’t want it and it can be polarizing. It’s just not worth it for them.”', 'In actively avoiding the news, Netflix joins Meta as a pioneering technology and media company that has upended the business models news organizations have relied on for decades, only to turn its back on the industry.', 'To be fair to these companies, there are plenty of business reasons to avoid dabbling in the news. First, news reporting is simply not as popular as entertainment content. Second, and perhaps more importantly for these companies, news has become incredibly polarizing in recent years.', 'Simply stating that the 2020 presidential election was not stolen — a proven fact — alienates Republicans. That polarizing factor means that not only is it more difficult to sell advertisements around the content, but that by carrying such programming, there is a chance a swath of the customer base will be turned off by the brand and motivated to unsubscribe.', 'Which is all to say that Netflix investing in news programming would translate into spending money on content that is not as popular as other genres, but far more risky to the overall business. From a purely business standpoint, avoiding that type of programming makes sense.', 'Of course, the counterargument is that these companies perhaps have a civic responsibility to invest in news and public affairs programming — especially since they contributed greatly to the destruction of the business model that had supported television newsrooms for so long. Journalists are crucial to thriving democracies and the hollowing out of the news industry has vast implications for the future of the free world.', 'It’s anything but unprecedented for large media companies to invest money in journalism. Warner Bros. Discovery has CNN. Comcast has NBC News. Disney has ABC News. Paramount has CBS News. The list goes on. And, back when cable was ascendant and disruptive, as Netflix is today, the major carriers financed the birth of C-SPAN, offering the public a continuous feed of its government at work. So, is it really out of the question to wonder whether a streamer like Netflix should consider a similar move to offer news programming that informs and enriches the public?', 'Rebuilding the traditional cable package without news is akin to putting together a meal that includes steak, potatoes and ice cream, but not the broccoli. The vegetables might not be the tastiest, most popular item on the menu, but neglecting them would not be healthy. Likewise, only investing in comedy and sports might be more satisfying for its audience, but it certainly isn’t a healthy choice for society.', 'That is the destination, though, where the current decisions are leading. And as the streaming revolution continues to take the wind out of the traditional cable bundle by poaching the rights to live sports, the once-towering television news outlets will be further diminished, turning the situation even more dire.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Hulu and Disney+, which make up its entertainment streaming business, notched $47 million in operating income.', 'DISNEY SHARES SINK AS STREAMING BUSINESS FALLS SHY OF PROFITABILITY', 'Iger, speaking at the conference, said Disney’s marketing expenses for its streaming business were ""too high"" because the entertainment giant ""didn’t build in technology to have not only the algorithms but the ability to send very, very highly customized messages to our subscribers where we believe they’re potentially at risk"" of canceling their membership.', 'One of Disney’s biggest streaming rival – Netflix – is ""brilliant at this,"" according to Iger. He has previously described Netflix as representing the ""gold standard"" and said Disney needed to make its streaming service technological capabilities comparable with those of its competitor.', 'READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP', 'Making investments in technology will help cut down how much Disney spends on marketing, per Iger.', ""DISNEY'S IGER TO HAVE HAND IN MARVEL'S MAKEOVER"", 'The entertainment giant must invest in technology ""to basically create much more to serve the user, to serve the customers, really, and it’s something that is really subtle, but really important, which is that first screen experience needs to be really customizable and dynamic and constantly changing"" each time subscribers use the Disney+ platform, the Disney CEO also said.', 'Artificial intelligence, Iger said, will play a significant role in that.', 'Other factors the Disney CEO highlighted as ""critical"" moves the company was working on to bring its streaming business to profitability included engagement and curbing password-sharing among users.', 'The entertainment giant recently incorporated Hulu into Disney+ for certain users and, later in the year, aims to start similarly putting ESPN+ in the platform.

But before you rush to scoop up this top streaming stock, first take the time to understand my three biggest bear cases for this industry-leading enterprise."", ""Netflix's ascent throughout the 2010s was nothing short of amazing. The business was able to add new subscribers in remarkable fashion primarily because it was a much better experience for consumers. "", 'Being able to choose from a massive list of shows and movies to watch what you want and when you want completely upended the traditional cable TV industry. Plus, it was cheaper.', ""But capitalism invites competition. And other media businesses didn't sit around resting on their laurels. These days, there are many streaming choices for viewers. This will continue to make it increasingly difficult for Netflix to stand out from a crowded pack. All streamers provide a superior user experience."", ""Netflix must deal with some deep-pocketed rivals like Walt Disney, Apple, and Amazon, all of which have compelling streaming services. There's also Alphabet's YouTube, which has an estimated 2.5 billion monthly active users."", 'Netflix will have to stay on top of its game if it wants to maintain its lead in a very competitive industry. If management slips up in any way, the business could find it difficult to add new members and keep its existing ones satisfied.', 'In the past 10 years, Netflix saw its quarterly revenue surge from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2014 to $9.4 billion in the same quarter of 2024. And the current subscriber base of 270 million is almost six times higher than it was back then. These are truly outstanding growth rates.', ""It's safe to assume that these gains aren't going to continue. Besides the competitive forces that I just talked about, Netflix has made substantial progress at penetrating its key markets, which limits expansion potential over the long run."", 'With 83 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada, Netflix is a mature service in these key markets. And with the company about a year into its password-sharing crackdown, a strategy that has helped boost customer additions, the incremental benefits could be coming to an end soon.', 'So, most of the member growth will likely come from emerging markets, particularly India. But the business has much less pricing power there, as GDP per capita pales in comparison to here in the U.S.', 'Investors with a critical eye might think that the current forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33.7 is too expensive given that growth will certainly decelerate in the years ahead.', ""There's one unique challenge that a company like Netflix faces, and that's what content to invest in. Contrast this with a business such as Chipotle, which has a proven playbook of opening new restaurants that generate revenue and cash flows that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy based on historical data."", ""Netflix essentially invests in art. Even if you have huge budgets and a long list of star actors and actresses for productions, the show or movie could still end up being a flop. Of course, Netflix's management team deserves credit for having built up some level of skill at content creation. "", ""It is concerning, however, that not only is developing and acquiring fresh content extremely expensive (something that isn't going to change), but its ultimate success is also unpredictable since no one really knows what viewers will gravitate toward."", ""Perhaps there's the chance that Netflix's return on these cash outlays starts to diminish over time.

OLLI."", 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Nvidia is the global leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Though Nvidia has been growing for years due to revenue streams from PC graphics and gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms, the company has experienced exploding, “hockey stick” like growth for its artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that support high-performance computing (HPC). Revenue from Nvidia’s complex and powerful chips has lifted NVDA to a more than $2 trillion market cap and has solidified the company as the undisputed leader in the AI space, far ahead of semiconductor competitors like Inteland Advanced Micro Devices.', 'Though Nvidia is already the dominant player in the AI space, visionary CEO Jensen Huang is not sitting back and enjoying the success. Instead, NVDA recently announced the Blackwell platform, “enabling organizations everywhere to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25x less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.” ', 'As mega-cap tech companies race to AI dominance, large language models like Open AI and Microsoft’sChatGPT will require efficiency for two reasons. First, large language models like ChatGPT require GPUs to “train” their models. Presently, companies like OpenAI and Alphabetare engaged in an AI arms race. Furthermore, by 2030 the data center share of electricity will be the equivalent of the electricity consumption of one-third of U.S. homes (which explains the recent bull trends in utility stocks like Vistra.', 'Earnings, which have already been growing like a weed, are expected to increase by a triple-digit clip over the next two quarters and juicy 84.72% next year.', 'Price is the ultimate “tell” in investing because it represents real supply and demand. From this standpoint, Nvidia is bullish for two reasons:', 'Relative Strength: While some AI-related stocks like Arm Holdingsand Super Micro Computerare well off their 52-week highs, NVDA is suffering a mild correction and is within 10% of its all-time high – a sign of relative strength.', 'Shakeout + Regain of 10-week MA: If investing were easy, everybody would be rich. Every so often stocks need to “shake the tree” and get rid of “weak hands” before resuming higher. NVDA plunged nearly 10% in mid-May before ripping back above the 10-week moving average (a level that has contained most of the stock’s multiyear move).', 'Our extensive, in-house back test shows that stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #3 or better and have a positive Earnings Surprise Prediction (ESP) score tend to beat earnings and outperform. Furthermore, while Wall Street is bullish on the stock, NVDA has beaten consensus estimates in 18 of the past 20 quarters.', 'Data center demand is not only due to AI, but also to cloud growth. Companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms and Baiduare all investing billions in expanding their cloud presence.', 'As automakers strive for autonomous vehicles, Nvidia stands to benefit. The company is working with more than 320 automakers, suppliers, and automotive research institutions to develop AI systems for self-driving vehicles.', 'Data center and AI growth, top-tier fundamentals, and new product offerings are just a few reasons to own Nvidia, the true market leader.', 'Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Peabody Energy is a preeminent coal producer engaged in the mining, processing, and the sale of coal through 17 operations, mainly in the United States and Australia. Peabody Energy mostly mines and processes thermal coal, which is utilized for power generation, and metallurgical coal, which is utilized in steel production.', 'In 2020, Coal stocks like BTU, Arch Resources and Warrior Met Coal were on the brink of collapse as demand plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and investor concerns about investors attempting to replace the entire industry with clean energy alternatives. Since then, several coal companies have gone bankrupt. Nevertheless, the ones that survived enjoyed recovering earnings and soaring stock prices.', 'However, despite the impressive recovery in coal demand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees global coal demand leveling off and cooling over the next few years and into 2026. The late 2023 report marks the first time the IEA has predicted a drop in global coal consumption. The reasons for the lower expectations include:', 'Though demand in developing nations like India and China is growing in the single digits, slowing demand in the European Union and the United States will likely outweigh the demand.', 'The IEA expects global demand to fall by 2.3% by 2026,“even in the absence of governments announcing and implementing stronger clean energy and climate policies.

This move aligns with the company's ongoing efforts to streamline operations, as it aims for approximately 65% of its stores to be automated by the end of fiscal 2026."", 'All said, the decision to invest in Walmart ahead of its quarterly earnings release demands a thoughtful evaluation of both potential rewards and inherent risks.', 'Walmart Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Walmart Inc.

As the most frequently mutated oncogene, KRAS has been a target of cancer scientists for decades, but the lack of accessible drug-binding sites kept it from being a druggable target.', 'This changed when scientists from the University of California San Francisco developed a KRAS G12C inhibitor in 2013, tapping into a targetable switch II pocket within the KRAS protein structure. Switch II pocket is a region where inhibitors can block the activity of G12C. This breakthrough is significant given that KRAS G12C mutations are found in approximately 13% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.', 'It then took nearly 10 years until the approval of Bristol Myers Squibb’s (BMS’s) Krazati (adagrasib) and Amgen’s Lumakras (sotarasbib), both of which are KRAS G12C inhibitors indicated to treat NSCLC. Their FDA approvals, which occurred in 2021 and 2022, respectively, were a breakthrough for the scientific community.', 'Soon afterwards, many other pharmaceutical companies began to develop their own KRAS-targeting drugs and therapeutics. The potential sales with these drugs are a big driver of development for companies, considering Krazati and Lumakras are forecast to reach combined sales of up to $3 billion in 2029, according to a GlobalData analysis.', 'The next frontier in the NSCLC space appears to be drugs that go beyond targeting the G12C domain and can treat other types of cancers, even potentially cross the blood-brain barrier. “This is the decade for RAS,” says Shubham Pant, professor of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Asfar Azmi, leader of the Molecular Therapeutics Research Program at Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, Michigan, explains that Krazati has shown early signs of some central nervous system (CNS) activity in ongoing trials. However, in completed studies, patients with active, untreated brain metastases have been usually excluded from participation, meaning little is known about the CNS efficacy of Krazati.', ""This is significant due to the amount of NSCLC patients who present with brain metastasis at the time of diagnosis. “About 40% of lung cancer patients have brain metastasis. That's a big number,” says Azmi."", '“Now, if you have a drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier as being shown by adagrasib, and to some extent sotarasib as well, then that would definitely be a game changer. [You] would now involve the 40% of patients who were earlier neglected or ignored in these trials,” Azmi adds.', 'Amgen and BMS are not the only companies with active programs in this space. AstraZeneca has developed a molecule called AZD4747, a potent and selective inhibitor of KRAS G12C that is designed to cross the blood-brain barrier.', 'In a presentation at the European Laboratory Research & Innovation Group’s (ELRIG’s) Research & Innovation 2024 conference in Manchester, UK, Jason Kettle, senior scientific director at AstraZeneca, said that AZD4747 has demonstrated high CNS exposure in dogs and primates. He concluded that the molecule “is uniquely positioned to treat CNS metastases relative to approved agents based on monkey positron emission tomography (PET) data.”', 'Azmi added that chemists designing KRAS inhibitors may aim for compounds that penetrate the blood-brain barrier and exhibit brain activity.', 'The replacement of the amino acid glycine at position 12 on KRAS leads to mutations that have been dubbed G12C, G12D, G12R, or others, depending on which amino acid replaces the glycine. Krazati and Lumakras both target KRAS G12C, which is a prominent mutation seen in NSCLC. However, certain cancers such as pancreatic cancer most commonly have the G12D mutation in the KRAS gene.', ""“Pancreatic cancer is one of the high priorities. It's a deadly disease. There is no cure for it. Now 80–90% of patients with pancreatic cancer have KRAS mutations, with the most prominent being G12D,” says Azmi."", 'Redwood City, California-based Revolution Medicines is taking a broader approach and developing a pan-RAS inhibitor, RMC-6236. The drug is a multi-selective non-covalent inhibitor designed to treat patients with cancers driven by a wide range of common RAS mutations. Pan-RAS inhibition means that all RAS isozymes co-expressed in the tumour cell population are targeted by a single inhibitor to block constitutively activated RAS regardless of the underlying mutation.', 'Despite the efficacy, a KRAS G12C inhibitor by itself is not a simple, guaranteed solution. KRAS G12C inhibitor monotherapies have demonstrated limited clinical efficacy due to primary and acquired resistance mechanisms. Therefore, even if the treatment initially appears to work, the cancer can relapse.', 'Multiple combinations of KRAS G12C inhibitors with other targeted therapies, such as receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, are being investigated in clinical trials to overcome the resistance, demonstrating promising efficacy.', 'For example, in April 2024, BMS reported positive data from its Phase I/II KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating Krazati plus Erbitux (cetuximab), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor developed by Eli Lilly. The trial met its primary endpoint, with 34% of the 94 metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients reaching a median progression-free survival of 6.9 months. The FDA accepted a supplemental new drug application for the combination treatment in February 2024 for previously treated KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic CRC for priority review, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date set for June 21, 2024.', '“Combination is the way to go forward. You cannot kill a tumour by just blocking KRAS. But what that combination is has to be very cautiously evaluated,” Azmi added.', 'Krazati and Lumakras are currently approved for use in metastatic NSCLC after cancer progression on chemotherapy and immunotherapy. However, new inhibitors are now being developed in the early cancer space, and away from primary treatments. “The success in the lung [cancer] area has propelled the field to explore more and has given us innovators. Not just small molecule drugs, but now vaccines,” says Azmi.', 'Pant is leading a clinical trial testing an adjuvant vaccine ELI-002 2P, developed by Boston, Massachusetts-based Elicio Therapeutics, with the potential to prevent the relapse of KRAS-mutated pancreatic cancers.', 'In the trial (NCT04853017), patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancer who were considered to be at high risk of relapse received a maximum of 10 doses of the ELI-002 vaccine targeted toward KRAS G12D and G12R mutations. T cell responses were seen in 84% of all patients and in 100% of those in the two highest-dose cohorts, including those who received the recommended Phase II dose of 10mg. The data from this trial has led to a Phase II trial, which is currently ongoing.', ""Cancer vaccines as an adjuvant treatment can stimulate the immune system to recognise and attack cancer cells after primary treatment like surgery or chemotherapy. Pant says there is a high risk of relapse in this setting, but the potential for effecting a change is also high. “I think that's where we can truly achieve the cure,” says Pant."", '""KRAS inhibitors: The next frontier beckons"" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Rules are in place to ensure these investment vehicles are the playground only for the rich. Small investors need not apply.', 'But you can still invest alongside the so-called “smart money.” Every three months investment managers have to file a Form 13F with the Securities & Exchange Commission. They detail the stocks they have bought and sold over the previous quarter. Scouring these reports gives you an idea of where billionaires are putting their money to work.', 'While you might not get the same price for the hedge fund stock picks, that can work to your advantage. No investor, not even Warren Buffett, regularly nails the exact bottom for a stock. By buying in later than the smart money can often get you better prices. Of course, a stock can runaway after it’s purchased, too. So let’s see where the three latest big hedge fund stock picks below sit.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sasima / Shutterstock.com', 'Three of the most influential names on Wall Street were piling into Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The vast majority of first quarter 13F’s haven’t been filed yet, but in the fourth quarter, the smart money bought over $16 billion worth of the second-largest artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker behind Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Of that amount, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT) and Vanguard purchased $8 billion, or half the total.', 'They haven’t done bad, as Broadcom stock is up 16% in 2024 and some 45% over the last six months (hedge funds could have acquired their stock anytime in Q4). Still, don’t feel you’ve missed the boat on the AI chip stock.', 'Although Broadcom is best known for the semiconductors it makes for mobile handsets, the chipmaker pivoted to data center infrastructure and its custom accelerators are in high demand. Broadcom reported first-quarter AI revenue surged 300% to $2.3 billion. It now expects AI will account for 35% of 2024 total revenue, or $10 billion. That’s up from its previous forecast of $8 billion. As data centers are a major growth market for the foreseeable future, there is still plenty of time to buy into AVGO stock.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Ride-share leader Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) was another target of the hedge fund triumvirate. Of the $10 billion worth of UBER stock purchased in Q4, Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard were responsible for buying 57% of it, or $6.2 billion.', 'Although Uber Technologies stock took a hit yesterday after reporting earnings and losing 6% of its value for the day, shares are up 37% over the last six months. Although CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah says Uber’s “multi-year growth framework is on track,” the market was disappointed with gross bookings which fell short of expectations. Still, the ride-share specialist expects to generate between $38.75 billion and $40.25 billion in gross bookings next quarter. That is an 18% to 23% year-over-year increase, suggesting this quarter was a one-off.', 'There is good reason to believe Uber Technologies’ stock will continue on its growth trajectory. The ride-share leader is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles. The goal is to eventually squeeze out its human drivers so it no longer has to share a fare with them. While CEO Dara Khosrowshahi noted driver earnings are “continuing to grow faster than our topline,” being able to keep all the money to itself will boost both revenue and profits. That is still well into the future but provides a growth target for Uber to aim for.', 'Source: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock', 'With inflation refusing to go away, it is not surprising to see gold miner Newmont (NYSE:NEM) on the radar of hedge funds. Over $5.1 billion was invested in Newmont stock in the fourth quarter, and Blackrock and Vanguard were big buyers again. Van Eck Associates was the third major private equity firm buying last quarter. Together, they purchased more than 61% of the total.', 'Newmont, though, has had a rocky ride. Shares are essentially unchanged in 2024 and up just 10% over the past six months. Considering an ounce of gold is up 18% in that time frame and this is one of those situations where retail investors can get just as good of a deal as the smart money, if not better.', 'Newmont is certainly benefiting from the higher prices. First-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.7 billion was 71% higher as year-ago sales volumes rose following its acquisition of Newcrest last November. It’s only going to get better as the year progresses.', 'The gold miner should see sales volumes continue trekking higher as its Pennasquito, Ahafo and Pueblo Viejo mines increase production after numerous setbacks last year.

A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns."", 'The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in Focus', ""The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector.

In the past five-year period, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.89%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend.

A key component of those returns was selected investments in stocks of strong companies in its $300-plus-billion equity portfolio. Let's look at two of its top stock holdings that can grow for decades."", 'Warren Buffett has a long history of betting big on strong consumer brands. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a loyal customer base that is willing to give up many other things before their iPhones.

It tends to come in cycles, such as when the company releases a popular new version of the iPhone. But even in years when Apple reports a slight decline in revenue, it's still seeing the active installed base of devices continue to grow."", ""A growing installed base is very valuable to Apple, as people who own more than one Apple device tend to spend more on apps and subscriptions in the App Store. Although services make up a small percentage of the company's total revenue, it generates higher margins."", 'Across all products and services, Apple raked in $100 billion in profit last year.

These results reflect management's ongoing push to grow the adoption of electronic payments and displace cash and checks. The traditional credit cards specialist is adapting to the increasingly digital global economy."", ""On that note, Mastercard secured more new deals in the quarter in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and Europe. It's also making progress in contactless transactions, such as Tap to Phone, which allows businesses to accept payment from a mobile wallet or contactless card on an NFC-enabled device. Mastercard is already accepted in over 100 million locations worldwide, but management believes Tap to Phone can extend that opportunity even further."", ""The company's strong brand and huge growth opportunities explain why Berkshire Hathaway held nearly 4 million shares worth $1.7 billion at the end of 2023.

The symptoms of asthma - coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing - are caused by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Genetic and environmental factors have been linked to asthma development, and triggers, such as allergens and infections can start or worsen asthma symptoms. Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening and may require emergency room visits and hospitalizations. While asthma can be managed by medications and avoiding triggers for most patients, there is currently no cure, and the burden of asthma on patients’ quality of life and on health resource utilization remains high.5', 'About the Merger Agreement', 'Under the terms of the transaction Johnson & Johnson (the Company) will acquire Proteologix.

And those that can last 30 years or more are rare. Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is close to accomplishing that sort of longevity."", ""Created in 1995, the medical device specialist hasn't just survived over the years, it has thrived. That's not to say Intuitive Surgical hasn't faced issues, but even with a range of headwinds coming its way, the healthcare pioneer should be able to deliver outsize returns for at least 10 more years. Here is why."", 'Surgeons typically make open incisions to reach the area they need to operate on. Minimally invasive surgeries, however, use tiny and highly maneuverable instruments that require far less skin cutting. The result is that patients typically experience less bleeding, recover more quickly, and spend less time in the hospital.', ""Intuitive Surgical's crown jewel, the da Vinci system, allows surgeons to perform robotic-assisted procedures that are minimally invasive. The healthcare company is the leader in this niche."", 'Although it makes money from the sale of da Vinci systems, most of its revenue comes from sales of the instruments and other accessories that need to be replaced after procedures. So the more operations that hospitals perform with a da Vinci, the more replacement instruments they need -- and the more sales Intuitive Surgical makes.', 'The increasing adoption of robotic-assisted surgery has led to growing revenue and earnings for Intuitive, and there are important long-term tailwinds that should allow it to thrive in the next decade and beyond.', ""First, according to some estimates, robotic surgeries are used in fewer than 5% of the possible procedures. Second, people are living longer thanks to medical advances, so the world's population is aging. Older people need more medical care, including more of the types of operations da Vinci robots perform."", ""Intuitive Surgical ended the first quarter with an installed base of 8,887 robots, a 14% increase year over year. Given the cost of these devices -- between $700,000 and $2.5 million -- and the time it takes to train surgeons on them, most hospitals that own one won't want to switch to another. That gives Intuitive Surgical a wide competitive most, along with a reputation that should attract many new healthcare facilities looking for a robotic device."", ""Let's turn to the risks. During the early COVID years, the company's procedure volume dropped substantially because of pandemic-related disruptions.

The core reason is investors have an abundance of low-risk, high-yield income options when interest rates spike.', 'Conversely, fund managers have historically pivoted to top-tier dividend stocks when interest rates fall. The logic behind this trend is that dividend stocks ought to deliver superior returns to risk-free assets like U.S. T-bills in low-rate environments.', ""Which dividend stocks should investors load up on before the Federal Reserve starts to cut rates? Although there are scores of options, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) have proven for decades to be an investor's best friend in terms of dependable dividend checks that keep increasing in size every year.

This feature makes this blue chip medtech stock a worthwhile addition to almost any type of portfolio.', ""Medtronic, a global medical device company, has consistently rewarded its shareholders with dividends. Speaking to this point, the company has increased its dividend for the past 46 consecutive years. This remarkable streak underscores the company's commitment to creating value for shareholders."", ""Medtronic stock pays a sizable yield of 3.27% on an annualized basis. However, the medical device titan's payout ratio is 87.2%, meaning that future raises to the payout may be constrained by earnings growth."", ""Indeed, Medtronic's five-year dividend growth rate of about 5% falls below its peer average (see above). The good news is the medtech company's shares are trading in bargain territory at 15.4x forward earnings, and its top-line growth is poised to accelerate in the coming years, thanks to its strong cardiac device pipeline."", 'Bargain hunters may want to stock up on this blue chip dividend equity before interest rates start moving down.

There are plenty of reasons to be bearish on the stock. Not only has it struggled to grow, but the company's razor-thin margins make it difficult to turn a profit. While it has been diversifying into healthcare with the launch of primary care clinics through its investment in VillageMD, that may only put greater strain on the business and its resources in the future."", 'Earlier this year, the company slashed its dividend in an effort to strengthen its financial position.

The reasons for its struggles also go back multiple years. Its planes have been plagued with safety concerns. In 2019, the Boeing 737 Max was temporarily grounded after it was involved in multiple fatal crashes, and there were reports of issues with engines, wiring, and the flight control computer. Earlier this year, the company made headlines again after a door flew off during a flight. It was later discovered that bolts meant to hold the door in place were missing.

Multiple industry sources familiar with the process said FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS), via surrogates, joined Boeing in lobbying Congress for a reprieve from the Jan. 1, 2028, production deadline. The legislation previously passed the Senate and will be sent to President Joe Biden to sign into law.', 'At face value, a split from international consensus would limit operation of freighters produced between 2028 and 2033 to the domestic U.S. market, but it’s possible some countries could permit access, according to experts. Freighters delivered before the end of 2027 aren’t covered by the enhanced carbon emission rules and won’t face any restrictions.', 'Under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreements, commercial aircraft manufacturers effectively can’t sell aircraft that don’t meet the 2028 carbon emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted the fuel efficiency standard in 2021 with the FAA following suit in February.', '', 'Even if post-2027 freighters end up being limited to domestic flying, it makes sense for FedEx and UPS to buy them, said Tom Crabtree, a Seattle-based industry consultant and former Boeing market analyst, in an interview.', '“The 767-300 production and converted freighter provides the lowest trip costs of any widebody freighter in production today while simultaneously allowing service to smaller markets where 50 metric tons of payload, or more, simply isn’t needed. They also have sufficient range to serve international markets to/from Europe and/or northern South America from the US,” he said.', 'Boeing stopped making the 767 as a passenger jet many years ago. It also supplies a tanker variant for militaries. FedEx and UPS are the only customers for the 767-300 freighter. Traditional cargo airlines opt for used 767s that have been converted to a cargo configuration because they don’t have the consistent, daily volumes of integrated express carriers and can’t afford more expensive new models.', 'UPS was the launch customer for the Boeing 767 freighter in 1995. The parcel logistics giant has 88 B767-300s in its fleet, including 10 converted freighters, and 19 additional factory aircraft on order from Boeing.', '', '“We expect to receive all outstanding orders before that time,” said UPS spokeswoman Michelle Polk.', 'FedEx has 137 B767s flying in its network, with 15 more deliveries scheduled through mid-2026, according to the company’s latest statistics.', 'Aviation publication The Air Current was first to unearth the 767 freighter waiver, tucked away on page 1,038 of the FAA bill. The language doesn’t mention the 767 by name, but the maximum takeoff weight of 180,000 kilograms to 240,000 kilograms squarely fits the 767.', 'Boeing officials have increasingly signaled that they plan to develop a freighter version of the 787 Dreamliner as a replacement for the 767F, but the first delivery is expected to take at least eight to 10 years.', '“The 767F continues to be the most environmentally sound mid-size freighter available. We are working with our customers and are in communication with regulators regarding the requirements for this market segment,” Boeing said in a statement before the vote. “As we look ahead to future medium-widebody freighter options, the 787 is a natural place for us to look. We continue to evaluate our options in this space and are listening to our customers. Any future decisions regarding whether to launch a new program, will be largely driven by customer needs and market demand.”', 'Without the exemption, FedEx and UPS could be limited to Airbus A330 converted cargo jets, a model neither currently operates, if they need more medium-widebody aircraft in four or five years. The feedstock for 767 conversions is drying up because passenger airlines like Delta and United are holding on to aircraft longer than anticipated in response to supply chain, manufacturing and engine-related problems that have delayed delivery of replacement aircraft. The airlines probably won’t be ready to let go of the 767s until “they are well beyond the age of conversion or have too many flight cycles and flight hours accumulated on them to make it worth a while to convert,” said Crabtree.', 'The new law will enable Boeing to compete with Israel Aircraft Industries, which installs 767 conversion kits, and an Airbus subsidiary that rebuilds A330s into freighters, and give it time to bring a 787 freighter to market, said the former chief editor of the biennial Boeing World Air Cargo Forecast. And A330 conversion providers would be able to demand higher pricing without that competition.', '“Express firms like the certainty of production freighters even though they are more expensive than conversions of the same airplane models,” he added. That certainty takes the form of more consistent delivery schedules and meeting of specifications.', '', 'FedEx and UPS put pressure on Congress to keep the 767 option open and keep the playing field level until Boeing brings out the 787 freighter, the sources said.', 'Many have interpreted the carve-out to the international fuel efficiency standards to mean that noncompliant aircraft will be prohibited from flying outside the United States. But there is no universal enforcement mechanism. ICAO’s carbon emission standard will be implemented by individual countries as new domestic regulations updating their system for certifying aircraft types. Production will essentially be banned starting in 2028 because noncompliant models will not be certified for sale by civil aviation authorities in their area of jurisdiction.', 'Countries that ban the sale of noncompliant models are likely to ban aircraft with an exemption from entering their airspace on the basis of having an unfair advantage.', 'But an aviation industry source, who didn’t want to be identified because of the political sensitivity of the topic, said FedEx and UPS access to airspace in foreign countries would depend on what individual governments are willing to accept. Smaller countries that typically follow FAA and European Union regulations rather than certify aircraft themselves might have fewer qualms with allowing exempted 767s to operate.', 'Boeing also continues to deliver 777 cargo jets to FedEx and other airlines around the world. The FAA reauthorization doesn’t provide a waiver for the 777 because Boeing expects to have a next-generation 777-X ready sometime in 2027.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Sign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\xa0', 'Boeing CEO says 787 freighter remains strong candidate to succeed 767F', 'Boeing certification troubles in Canada ground 1st WestJet freighters', 'The post Congress exempts Boeing 767 freighter from 2028 production cutoff appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

LMT recently clinched a contract involving High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). The award has been provided by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.', 'Valued at $861.3 million, the contract is expected to be completed by May 31, 2026.\xa0 Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will manufacture HIMARS and provide the supporting services associated with it.', 'Nations are reinforcing their military capabilities to strengthen their defense structure in the growing threat environment. In this context, increased spending has been witnessed on missile capabilities, resulting in a significant order inflow for companies like Lockheed Martin, which enjoy a dominant position in the development of missiles.', 'To this end, it is imperative to mention that LMT’s HIMARS is the most technically advanced, affordable and sustainable artillery solution that provides cutting-edge technology on an indigenous platform. HIMARS provides unmatched long-range mobile firepower to support Joint All-Domain Operations. It can launch the entire Multiple Launch Rocket System family of munitions.', 'Such remarkable features of the HIMARS are likely to have been boosting its demand significantly. This can be gauged from the fact that Lockheed has already increased the production capacity of HIMARS from 48 per year to 60 per year.', 'The global peace index reflects an unstable environment worldwide with the Russia-Ukraine war continuing for more than two years now, in addition to the ongoing hostility prevalent in different parts of the Middle East. This has set the stage for the defense sector to witness rising demand for military products, particularly missiles, as nations worldwide strive to protect their borders from unprecedented attacks. As the demand for missiles is on the rise, so is the demand for missile launchers like HIMARS.', 'Therefore, the growth prospect for the missile and missile defense systems market remains solid. To this end, the Mordor Intelligence firm projects the missile and missile defense systems market to witness a CAGR of 5% over the 2024-2029 period.', 'LMT’s proficiency in manufacturing missiles and associated missile launchers, particularly that of HIMARS, positions it favorably to capitalize on the growth opportunities offered by the aforementioned market. The fact that Lockheed Martin remains on track to double the production of its HIMARS to 96 per year by the end of 2024, makes us confident that the company will witness more order flows for this product, like the latest one. Such contract wins, in turn, are likely to boost revenue growth for the company’s MFC unit, which witnessed a solid 25.3% year-over-year growth in its top line in the first quarter.', 'LMT apart, other prominent defense contractors that stand to benefit from the expanding missile and missile defense systems market are as follows:Northrop Grumman NOC: Northrop is a prominent developer of missile systems and counter systems, including strategic deterrents, subsystems and components. Its product portfolio includes the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System, the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System propulsion and warhead subsystems, the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile and a few other combat-proven products that support missile defense systems.', 'NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northrop’s 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 4.6% from the 2023 reported figure.', 'General Dynamics GD: General Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the system integrator of the 2.75-inch Hydra-70 family of rockets. It is a key supplier of major strategic and tactical missile programs ranging from warheads to missile housings, structural components to solid rocket motor cases.', 'GD has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11%. The consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 10.5% from the 2023 reported figure.RTX Corp. RTX: RTX’s business unit, Missiles and Defense, is a prominent U.S. missile maker. Its portfolio includes the AIM-9X Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X Block II missile, RAM-guided missile weapon system, etc. In a partnership with BAE Systems, RTX has built the Excalibur artillery projectile, which increases precision, minimizes collateral damage and reduces the logistical burden for artillery forces.', 'RTX boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2024 sales indicates an improvement of 6.2% from the 2023 reported figure.', 'In the past year, shares of Lockheed Martin have risen 3.4% against the industry’s 7.8% decline.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Nike introduced in December a cost-saving plan not only to reduce its workforce, but to tighten supply, increase use of automation, and restructure its management. CFO Matt Friend said spending slowdowns were responsible for the strategy shift as the company reported just 1% quarterly revenue growth to $13.4 billion compared to the same period a year before. While the American company has a market capitalization of $137.5 billion, making it the biggest sneaker brand in the world, it’s beginning to lose ground to a wealth of stiff competition.', '""We are seeing indications of more cautious consumer behavior around the world,"" Friend told analysts in December. ""We know in an environment like this, when the consumer is under pressure and the promotional activity is higher, it\'s newness and it\'s innovation which causes the consumer to act.”', 'Though wholly owned by Nike, Converse has its own marketing, development, and supply chain that operates discretely from its parent, but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t contributed to Nike’s woes. Making up 5% of the company’s sales, Converse’s revenue slumped almost 20% to $495 million in its third quarter, the company reported in March earnings.', 'Converse owes its struggles in part to being late in adopting trends appealing to younger generations in a crowded sea of shoe options, Jessica Ramírez, senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates, told Fortune. It’s a similar problem to what Nike as a whole is experiencing.', ""“There's just an endless amount of options for the consumer today,” Ramírez said. “That's really what has dented part of Nike…They need excitement.”"", 'Pandemic-era habits have been a boon for the running industry, boosting brands like On and Hoka that have dominated the sector because they’ve appealed to the growing crowd of casual runners, Ramírez argued. On, a Roger Federer-based Swiss brand, posted a 29% leap in first-quarter year-over-year sales worth $560 on Tuesday, the first time the company passed the half-billion milestone. Hoka made similar strides with 21.9% sales growth to $429.3 million from the same quarter a year before.', 'For lifestyle shoes, consumers have picked Adidas’ Sambas and Gazelles over Nike’s once-reliable Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1 designs after the German sneaker brand heavily marketed the shoe’s nostalgia-factor. Adidas sales in Europe rocketed 14% in its most recent quarter, in large part because of the popularity of the classic shoe.', 'Nike has responded to the competition by introducing a new Pegasus running shoe and scaling back its available Air Force designs. But what should be concerning Nike is not that Adidas is taking a bite out of its audience, Ramírez said, but rather that consumers are interested in sporting more than just those two big brands, lacing up running shoes for all occasions beyond just an early morning jog.', ""“If you look at people's feet today, you don't necessarily have either Adidas or Nike,” she said. “You have absolutely everyone playing in the field.”"", 'Nike has further been hurt by its recent investment in direct-to-consumer sales that have yielded inconsistent results. A way for the company to more directly engage with its consumer base, Nike’s DTC strategy was an initial success in 2022, generating $18.7 billion, but by February 2024, direct sales were beginning to stagnate at 42% of the company’s total sales. Digital sales for the company were down 3%, while wholesales were up 3%. Responding to wholesale interest, Nike has leaned more into retailers like Dick’s, which saw record-breaking fourth quarter sales in March that rose 7.8% to $3.9 billion.', 'Ramírez argued that Nike has set itself up to grow with its wide reach. Now it’s just up to the brand to stand out in the crowd.', '“Nike is still a premium brand, is still going to be that juggernaut,” she said. “But there is a lot more out there than there ever has before that is resonating with many consumers today.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

And that was certainly the case here.”', 'VF’s decision to jettison the jeans business was part of a company effort to focus on “retail-minded” and “activity-based lifestyle brands” like Vans and The North Face.', 'But the subtext was clear. While the powerhouse VF pushed on to new heights, the wholesale-heavy Lee and Wranger were being left behind. (Or at least VF shareholders, who received shares of Kontoor, had the option to leave them behind).', 'But, despite all of its advantages, VF stumbled hard with Vans, failed to keep up with consumers, loaded up on debt to buy Supreme and saw its market capitalization fall from more than $30 billion to $5 billion at the close on Wednesday.', 'Kontoor, meanwhile, has shown steady growth, with its market cap growing from about $2 billion to $3.8 billion over the past five years.', 'It was Baxter’s job to navigate Lee and Wrangler out into the public market and take the helm — and it wasn’t an easy assignment. But looking back, the CEO said the trials of the spin-off also helped solidify the Kontoor team and set the business up for success, even as it launched into the jaws of the pandemic.', '“Our parent company wanted to get us out of there as fast as possible,” Baxter said. “We did it in 10 months, which is too fast. You have to make too many concessions. To hit the goal, to go ahead and spin, you had to just continually move the ball forward. It didn’t give you enough time for true analyzation in planning.', '“That’s the key to a really successful spin-off from the very beginning — really analyze the business, really analyze the spin, and then really establish the processes that are going to go forward,” he said.', 'To move fast, Kontoor basically cloned VF, adopting the larger company’s structure and approach, from supply chain to hiring practices, Baxter said, giving the company an infrastructure designed for a business four times the size.', '“You end up with maybe people in the wrong places, people with the wrong titles, people working on the wrong projects,” Baxter said.', 'Kontoor also spun out without the right IT system and relied on access to VF’s system while it installed its own enterprise resource planning system, which controls everything from the supply chain to how vendors get paid.', '“Ours, it was stable, it was just old,” Baxter said. “We needed the new ERP system. So we did two things that are the hardest things to do in business: spin off and then put it in the ERP system.”', 'Meanwhile, Baxter was trying to create a new corporate culture and identity for the company.', '“Most of your employees came from the old culture,” he said. “They were long tenured employees used to doing things a certain way. So you’ve got to start retraining and you’ve got to start reprogramming and rethinking about how you want your culture to look.”', 'That reset was important as the mission had changed and the jeans businesses no longer had to send the cash they generated to the larger company.', '“We were a cash cow and we referred to that often as a cash cow for the rest of the company,” Baxter said. “Now we were finally able to use our own money for ourselves. The brands hadn’t been invested in really, we hadn’t been building new product, designing new product or going after other channels.', '“We started investing behind the brands and to, I guess, the surprise of a lot of people, the brands started responding really well, and the consumer started responding really well, and we started hiring some good people and all of a sudden a little bit of success and a little bit more success. And here we are today doing fairly well.”', 'In a tough time for budget consumers wracked by inflation, Kontoor saw revenues dip 1 percent to $2.6 billion — slightly above the $2.5 billion in revenues seen in 2019. Net income last year totaled $231 million. And the journey continues with “Project Jeanius,” the company’s new effort to simplify and transform its processes further, creating $50 million and $100 million in gross profit improvement and cost savings.', 'Kontoor has gone beyond establishing itself and is reshaping for the future. Baxter said there’s no playbook on how to spin off a business — “you learn along the way” — but having done it once, he now sees more opportunities to set brands free from their portfolios.', '“When I look at a big business, when I look at a house of brands, I sit and I think about, ‘Wow, that doesn’t fit. That might perform better if it was spun off or if it was somewhere else.’”', 'Once is enough for Baxter, but he did have a few tips for anyone looking to bring a brand out on its own.', '“Establish a really good process, have open communication, and don’t allow the parent company to win every single battle,” he said. “We got hit pretty hard.”', 'The Bottom Line is a business analysis column written by Evan Clark, deputy managing editor, who has covered the fashion industry since 2000.

Stranded on a metal platform, he and a colleague crouched low as black smoke engulfed them. “I couldn’t see my coworker,” Guillen said. “I couldn’t even see the sun.”', 'Most Read from Bloomberg', 'Slovak Premier Fighting for Life After Assassination Attempt', 'US Inflation Data Was Accidentally Released 30 Minutes Early', 'US Inflation Ebbs for First Time in Six Months in Relief for Fed', 'China Considers Government Buying of Unsold Homes to Save Property Market', 'F1 Mogul’s Ex-Wife Builds Family Office to Manage Divorce Riches', 'When the men were finally able to scramble down three flights of cage ladders — the soles of their boots liquefying on the hot metal — they emerged with burns on their wrists, hands, faces and ears. “I saw my coworker’s nose basically melt off,” said Guillen.', 'They were relatively lucky. Scott Higgins, a 55-year-old machinist, burned to death. It was the Texas refinery’s worst tragedy since 2005, when an explosion killed 15 and injured scores more.', 'The source of the blast was a leaking pump that the company had identified as needing maintenance, according to an internal Marathon investigation shown to refinery workers and described to Bloomberg. But the work, along with other vital upkeep, got pushed back amid the company’s drive to maximize production.', 'Marathon, the largest fuel producer in the US, had for two years been deferring maintenance at its plants, in part to take advantage of historically high refining margins. They weren’t alone. When gasoline consumption rebounded after the worst of the pandemic, many refiners postponed maintenance as profits to turn oil into fuel shot to a record high.', '“When margins are high, there’s a lot of financial pressure not to shut the refinery down for maintenance,” said Daniel Horowitz, a former managing director at the US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. “That can lead to accidents.”', 'Marathon, which is facing litigation related to the blast, declined to comment on the matter. But a spokesman said in a statement: “We are deeply saddened by the loss of our colleagues,” adding, “We operate our facilities with the highest commitment to the safety and health of our workers and the community.”', 'What happened at Galveston Bay highlights a challenge faced by fuelmakers across the country. The US refining system — already stretched to the limit after the pandemic shuttered more than 1 million barrels a day of capacity — is scrambling to meet ever-higher fuel demand with an aging fleet of plants that require costly and regular overhauls. Maximizing fuel production when margins are high is common industry practice, with refiners trying to ensure worker safety while maintaining their fiscal responsibility to their shareholders.', 'They don’t always strike that balance. Deferred maintenance is a root cause of refinery deaths in the US, according to a 2006 report from insurer Swiss Re. But while the pattern is well-documented, US oversight is floundering: Government data on injuries and deaths is patchy, and penalties for violating safety regulations often amount to little more than a rounding error in company balance sheets.', 'In the lead-up to the Galveston Bay explosion, Marathon deferred a type of maintenance that, according to the company’s internal investigation, would have helped to catch a crack on a pump near a gasoline-making unit. Instead, the pump continued running — and eventually leaking — highly flammable chemicals. A nearby sprinkler system was also broken, an OSHA inspection showed.', 'Marathon, in a statement, characterized its internal investigation as “part of our comprehensive process for continuously improving personal and process safety across our operations.”', '“We strive to provide a work environment where our employees and teams are empowered to take whatever action is necessary to achieve our goal of an injury-free workplace,” the company said.', 'Yet days before the May 15 explosion last year, the company’s then-Chief Financial Officer Maryann T. Mannen characterized delayed repairs as “good decisions” that enabled Marathon to meet rising fuel demand after the pandemic. Indeed, Marathon’s refining profits, as well as its annual net income, were the highest on record the year before the explosion.', 'Legacy of Deadly Cost-Cutting', 'To be sure, the Galveston Bay refinery had a deadly record well before Marathon purchased the plant in 2013. It was also the site of the 2005 Texas City explosion that killed 15 workers and injured 180. The cause of that blast, according to a CSB investigation, was cost-cutting by then-owner BP Plc.', 'The BP explosion, known as one of the worst refinery disasters in US history, became the first in a string of major incidents that forever marred the company’s safety and environmental record. Just months after the Texas City fire, while BP was still contending with the fallout, company pipelines spilled more than 5,000 barrels of crude in Alaska. In 2010, an explosion at the offshore Deepwater Horizon drilling rig killed 11. The company eventually sold the Texas City refinery to Marathon – which renamed it Galveston Bay – to help cover the costs of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.', 'After Marathon acquired the refinery, the company made strides in improving safety, according to current and former workers. But after the pandemic decimated fuel demand, the cost-cutting began again. Post-pandemic, Marathon eliminated dozens of refinery operator positions and combined processing units to consolidate supervision, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named for fear of retribution. The gasoline-making ultraformer that blew up on May 15, 2023, was one such unit, said the people. Before 2021, the ultraformer was monitored by a single operator. After that, it was combined with two other units, meaning a single operator had to manage all three simultaneously.', 'The cutbacks came at a time when workers were already leaving the industry at a faster-than-usual pace according to Faisal Khan, director of the Mary Kay O’Connor Process Safety Center at Texas A&M. Many senior operators retired early in 2020, and the industry is struggling to replace them with younger workers. Workforce shortages, along with deferred maintenance, are the top two risk factors for deadly accidents, he added.', 'To fill the gap, companies are increasingly relying on third-party contractors such as Guillen. Contractors are cheaper than employees — they’re usually not unionized and they aren’t full-time. But they do some of the most dangerous work in the plants.', 'Meanwhile, the Galveston Bay plant has recorded more emissions events than any other Texas refinery last year, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality data compiled by Bloomberg. Those are often the result of unit breakdowns that can lead to unsafe conditions for workers.', '“Every time you have a breakdown, eventually, it’s going to cause a fatality,” said Norman Lieberman, an engineering consultant who worked at Galveston Bay in the 1970s.', 'Failing Oversight', 'Deaths in the refining sector are relatively rare compared with professions like logging. But the data are deceiving, according to Jordan Barab, former deputy assistant director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, called OSHA, under the Obama administration, and a vocal critic of the oil industry.', 'Bureau of Labor Statistics data, for example, show zero refinery deaths for 2005, although 15 workers died in the Texas City explosion that year. OSHA doesn’t keep refinery-specific injury and fatality statistics, and the data it does collect is often incomplete. In order to find those 15 fatalities in the OSHA database, one must know which contractor employed each worker, and under which regional OSHA office the reports were filed.', 'Enforcement is an issue, too. OSHA’s refinery safety rules were written in 1992 and haven’t kept up with changes to plant operations, said Mini Kapoor, a partner at Haynes & Boone who’s an expert on OSHA. And while the agency hired more inspectors and issued new directives for the industry under President Barack Obama, some of those changes were reversed under President Donald Trump.', 'Even when plants are found in violation of the rules, the fines levied often do little to change how companies operate.', 'Marathon’s Galveston Bay was among the most heavily fined refineries by OSHA last year. For last year’s deadly fire, OSHA initially fined the refinery $62,500 but after Marathon disputed the penalties, OSHA withdrew two of four citations, along with half the fines, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg through a Freedom of Information Act request. Before that, the plant hadn’t paid a fine since 2018.', 'OSHA declined to comment.', 'No Choice But to Go Back', 'It’s only through a fluke that Guillen and his colleagues are able to sue Marathon for their injuries.', 'Marathon, like most Texas refiners, asks contractors to sign onto an owner-controlled insurance program, called an OCIP, which ties the contractor’s insurance to the refinery’s workers’ compensation program. Under Texas law, workers’ comp precludes litigation, except in certain extreme circumstances. So contractors under OCIP can’t sue even if they’ve been gravely injured.', 'The system “severely limits the rights of contractors to pursue a claim against the property owner even if it’s entirely the property owner’s fault,” said Muhammad Aziz, a lawyer representing Guillen and other workers injured in last year’s blast.', 'But Guillen’s contract company, Mistras Group, hadn’t yet signed an OCIP with Galveston Bay when the fire occurred. Guillen and five other injured coworkers will seek more than $1 million each in damages.', 'Three months after the fire, Marathon’s Mannen acknowledged the event in an earnings call. “An incident that occurred at one of the refinery’s catalytic reformers,” she said, “resulted in approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude throughput reduction and an approximate 1% reduction to capture.” She did not mention Higgins’ death, or the injured workers.', 'Marathon’s margins that year fell from a record high, but only slightly. This year, margins have remained elevated.', 'Guillen is still not fully healed. Aside from the burns, he says he has chronic back pain and a throbbing in his ears. He also has nightmares, although they’ve gotten better. “I used to try to go to sleep and close my eyes and all I could see was red around,” he said.', 'But he’s still planning to return to refinery work. Shortly after the fire, he had a baby, and the bills are piling up. “I feel like I have no choice but to go back,” he said. “But, honestly, I’m very frightened.”', '--With assistance from Mia Gindis and Lucia Kassai.', 'Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek', 'How the ‘Harvard of Trading’ Ruined Thousands of Young People’s Lives', 'The DNA Test Delusion', 'Kids Hooked on Video Games Prompt a Flurry of Lawsuits', 'Silicon Valley Is Searching for Its Piece of the AI Action', 'Europe’s Banks Find Breaking Up With Russia Is Hard to Do', '©2024 Bloomberg L.P.']"

However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price."", 'When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price.

One way you can find deals is by looking at stocks which are trading below their book values. Depending on the industry and the risk a company is facing, investors may not be willing to pay even book value for a stock. And in some cases, that risk is overblown, and it could make for a great buying opportunity.', ""Three stocks that are trading below their book values today are Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Citigroup (NYSE: C), and General Motors (NYSE: GM). Let's take a closer look at these stocks to see if they are too risky to invest in, or if they are bargain buys."", 'Kraft Heinz is a popular consumer goods company. It has many top brands in its portfolio such as Oscar Mayer and Kool-Aid, in addition to Kraft and Heinz. ', 'Over the years, however, the company has faced challenges. In 2018, it wrote down its assets to the tune of $15.4 billion. And in 2019, it also slashed its dividend. In short, the company has lost the trust of its shareholders over the years. Over a five-year period, the stock is up just 11%. The S&P 500, meanwhile, has generated returns of more than 80% during that same stretch.', ""And while the company has been relying on price increases to boost its growth, that strategy may be running out of steam. In its most recent quarter, for the period ended March 30, Kraft's sales declined by 1.2% to $6.4 billion, and profits fell by 4% to $801 million. There could be more headwinds ahead for the business as inflation remains a problem, and as long as that's the case, private-label products may be more attractive to consumers than Kraft's big brands."", ""In the long run, however, it still may be an attractive buy. At 4.4%, the stock's high dividend yield is one of the main reasons for investing in Kraft right now. As long as you temper your expectations, this could make for a sound long-term investment."", ""It's not uncommon for bank stocks to trade at or around their book values. But in Citigroup's case, it's trading nowhere near its book value. Investors are hesitant with Citigroup, as the company is in the midst of a restructuring effort to become leaner and more efficient. Over the next two years, the top bank is planning to shed 20,000 jobs from a global workforce of 239,000. In 2021, the company announced it would be exiting more than a dozen consumer banking markets in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. "", ""While scaling down its operations may improve margins, it also limits the growth opportunities for the business in the long run. In its most recent quarter (for the first three months of 2024), the company's net income fell by 27% to less than $3.4 billion. Credit costs rose by 20%, with Citigroup incurring net credit losses of $2.3 billion during the period versus just $1.3 billion a year ago. And with potentially tougher economic conditions ahead, things may not get much easier for Citigroup as the year goes on."", ""Down 6% in five years, Citigroup's returns have been even worse than Kraft's. While the stock does appear to be cheap, and it does pay an above-average yield of 3.3% (the S&P 500 average is 1.5%), this is another stock that investors should be careful with here. While there is a good margin of safety with the stock right now, and it too could be a good buy for the long term, investors should prepare for what could still be a bumpy ride ahead with Citigroup."", ""Automaker General Motors rounds out this list of discounted stocks. Its five-year return of 21% is the highest of the stocks on this list, which is still far below the S&P's performance. "", ""Trading at low multiples is nothing new for the car company, as its massive debt load is a big reason investors aren't eager to pay a high price for the stock. As of the end of March, the company's total non-current liabilities (including long-term debt and other liabilities) were $114.2 billion -- more than its current assets of $106.5 billion. While GM doesn't need to worry about paying all that in the short term, it's still a risk that hovers over the company, especially as interest rates remain high."", 'The positive is that the business is still generating strong operating results. Last quarter, revenue totaled $43 billion and rose nearly 8% year over year. The net income of nearly $3 billion also improved by 24% from the prior-year period. However, with consumer demand potentially softening as economic conditions worsen, GM may face no shortage of challenges. ', 'With interest rates likely to come down at some point within the next year, GM could soon become a much more attractive option to risk-averse investors. At a discounted valuation, this is another stock you may want to consider adding to your portfolio.', 'Before you buy stock in Kraft Heinz, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Kraft Heinz wasn’t one of them.

Other Pride-related products were moved to less prominent locations in its stores.', 'More from WWD', ""Gen Alpha's Influence on Millennial Spending Power Predicted to Be Swift and Impactful"", 'Pride Month Celebrates Its 25th Anniversary: The 2024 Collections From Brands That Give Back to Support LGBTQIA+ Community', 'Equality Fashion Week Returns to L.A., Focusing on Fashion, Small Businesses and Education', 'Typically held throughout the month of June, Pride commemorates and celebrates lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride and the LGBTQIA+ community at large.', 'Unlike last year, when children’s Pride apparel was in the mix, this year’s Pride offerings at Target will include adult apparel, home products and food and beverages, which have been “curated based on guest insights and consumer research,” according to a statement issued by Target Wednesday, in response to an interview request from WWD. Those items will retail starting at $3, and will be available in select stores and on\xa0target.com.', 'That distribution is reportedly going to be significantly less than last year.', 'The Target statement continued, “Target is committed to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and year-round. Most importantly, we want to create a welcoming and supportive environment for our LGBTQIA+ team members, which reflects our culture of care for the over 400,000 people who work at Target. We have long offered benefits and resources for the community, and we will have internal programs to celebrate Pride 2024.”', 'The company will also have a presence at local Pride events in Minneapolis and around the country, and will continue to support a number of LGBTQIA+ organizations.', 'After\xa0Target\xa0removed Pride-related merchandise from its stores last year following a social media backlash and pushback from conservative consumers and advocates, 100 LGBTQIA+ organizations joined forces to appeal to the national chain. They asked that Target provide necessary security measures for employees’ safety while also showing support for the LGBTQIA+ community by denouncing extremists.', 'Humankind’s manufacturing partner informed Marzullo that Target would not be carrying the brand’s swimwear for Pride, according to Marzullo. She claimed to have had “dozens of phone calls and emails” with Target’s “highest leadership talking about future years. There was no way to change what this year was going to be because you need to order by August-September to get things in time for Pride. But they were working on something bigger. They wanted a year-round assortment,” she said.', 'Marzullo said the retailer wanted to leverage Humankind, because it has the authenticity that the chain needs and recognizes. “But I haven’t heard a single thing. At this point, Target is just capitalizing off the community,” the founder and CEO said.', 'The Target spokesperson disregarded questions about Humankind.', 'From Marzullo’s standpoint, the best part about Humankind’s business and the LGBTQIA+ community is customers’ loyalty and that is expected to strengthen with the introduction of new products that don’t exist in the market. Five years ago, Marzullo started Humankind as an inclusive swimwear brand with the goal of making everyone feel comfortable and confident. It now generates annual sales in the seven figures and is produced overseas.', 'Last year’s controversy with Target hasn’t deterred her in any way. “We continue doing business like we always have. Pride is six or eight weeks out of the year depending on how people want to share their support. But for us as a company, we celebrate inclusivity year-round with different products and collections that go beyond swimwear and Pride,” Marzullo said.', 'Set up “to really grow,” Humankind is not for sale but its founder said she is focused on what’s next. With a background in brand development and marketing, Marzullo previously ran her own consulting businesses working with Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics, Buck Mason and a handful of others.', 'Humankind aims to expand by selling to other retailers, provided they are inclusive 365 days a year. “As a company, we’re going to be incredibly cautious about who we partner with moving forward during Pride based on this experience [with Target],” Marzullo said. “This is a warning basically to a lot of other brands, who aren’t supportive year-round. They use queer-owned brands to show their allyship, during June. But they just drop the ball afterward.”', 'From 2010 to 2019, U.S. states with the highest proportions of LGBTQIA+ residents were associated with more pronounced economic growth, according to a study released last year by Wells Fargo. The community contributes more than $1.7 trillion to the U.S. economy, based on data from the National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce. There are also 1.4 million LGBTQIA+ business owners nationwide.', 'Having had a partnership with Target the past few years, Marzullo said she has known for the last eight months that Humankind would not be featured in Target’s Pride assortment and that the overall assortment would be a lot smaller. “I’m pretty disappointed about that but I can’t really do very much about that.', '“It’s unfortunate that inclusive clothing and Pride in general is being politicized. We needed Target to double down this year after what happened in 2023. Instead Target is choosing to play it safe, which is not how you show your support,” Marzullo said.', 'Having bootstrapped the business by herself, Marzullo said she is its only employee. She said what is disappointing about Target’s decision is that the plan was to expand beyond swimwear, which is still in the works, but being in a national retailer made Humankind’s products more accessible. “We were able to be in every door nationwide, sell hundreds of thousands of units and our product helped so many people feel comfortable and confident in swimwear that was something that they did not normally feel. What’s incredibly disappointing is that we’re taking one step back now and asking, ‘What’s the next move to make sure that our product is accessible?’”', 'In addition, Marzullo said she is asking, “’How do we do that in a world where there is a lot of controversy and a lot of people, who don’t necessarily want a lot of inclusive products? I don’t understand why.”', 'Being tied to a national retailer also can introduce some to the LGBQTIA+ community, raise awareness about issues and offer accessibility including from a pricepoint standpoint, but now “all of that has been taken away from a community that so desperately needs that,” Marzullo said. “What I would love to see is awareness that goes past June. Everyone is talking about this now. I’ve been talking about this for the last eight months. This stuff doesn’t just go away because the media stops reporting on it.”', 'Claiming that Target had “led Humankind on for the last year with this idea that they would build this year-round assortment” of inclusive category on the sales floor and online 365 days a year, Marzullo does not expect to see that happen in the next year and claimed that Target does not have a team in place for that.', 'Best of WWD', 'Confidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?', 'San Francisco Authorities Seize Nearly $2 Million in Suspected Stolen Merchandise', 'Year in Review: The IPO Rush Transforming Fashion']"

And those that can last 30 years or more are rare. Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) is close to accomplishing that sort of longevity."", ""Created in 1995, the medical device specialist hasn't just survived over the years, it has thrived. That's not to say Intuitive Surgical hasn't faced issues, but even with a range of headwinds coming its way, the healthcare pioneer should be able to deliver outsize returns for at least 10 more years. Here is why."", 'Surgeons typically make open incisions to reach the area they need to operate on. Minimally invasive surgeries, however, use tiny and highly maneuverable instruments that require far less skin cutting. The result is that patients typically experience less bleeding, recover more quickly, and spend less time in the hospital.', ""Intuitive Surgical's crown jewel, the da Vinci system, allows surgeons to perform robotic-assisted procedures that are minimally invasive. The healthcare company is the leader in this niche."", 'Although it makes money from the sale of da Vinci systems, most of its revenue comes from sales of the instruments and other accessories that need to be replaced after procedures. So the more operations that hospitals perform with a da Vinci, the more replacement instruments they need -- and the more sales Intuitive Surgical makes.', 'The increasing adoption of robotic-assisted surgery has led to growing revenue and earnings for Intuitive, and there are important long-term tailwinds that should allow it to thrive in the next decade and beyond.', ""First, according to some estimates, robotic surgeries are used in fewer than 5% of the possible procedures. Second, people are living longer thanks to medical advances, so the world's population is aging. Older people need more medical care, including more of the types of operations da Vinci robots perform."", ""Intuitive Surgical ended the first quarter with an installed base of 8,887 robots, a 14% increase year over year. Given the cost of these devices -- between $700,000 and $2.5 million -- and the time it takes to train surgeons on them, most hospitals that own one won't want to switch to another. That gives Intuitive Surgical a wide competitive most, along with a reputation that should attract many new healthcare facilities looking for a robotic device."", ""Let's turn to the risks. During the early COVID years, the company's procedure volume dropped substantially because of pandemic-related disruptions. Though a global pandemic won't happen often (hopefully), could the increasing competition in the robotic-assisted surgery market have a similar impact on Intuitive Surgical? Companies including Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson want to enter this field."", ""That shouldn't be too much of a problem. Neither Medtronic's Hugo system nor Johnson & Johnson's Ottava is approved in the U.S. yet (and that could still take some time), but considering how severely underpenetrated this market is, there should be more than enough room for all three."", ""Something else that is threatening Intuitive's procedure volume is the increased popularity of weight-loss medicines. The da Vinci system is used to perform bariatric surgery to help with obesity, but if patients opt for these therapies instead, that means fewer such procedures."", ""The company has said that it is already seeing this dynamic play out, but bariatric surgery accounts for only about 4% to 5% of total worldwide procedures, according to management. And it isn't as if obesity medicines are taking over in this type of care. So given the vast runway ahead, this should mean very little to long-term investors."", ""Intuitive Surgical has many qualities of a stock worth owning for a decade or more. It is a leader in an industry ripe for growth, it has a strong competitive advantage, it delivers solid and consistent revenue and earnings, and it has an excellent track record.

The market seems to be sleeping on Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL), Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), and Sleep Number (NASDAQ: SNBR). This is your wake-up call.', ""Chewy and Sleep Number have been disappointing lately, but their weak stock charts are dismissing where the two companies could be in a year or two. Royal Caribbean's stock chart looks great, but the market is still pricing the class act of the cruising industry at a mere 13 times this year's projected earnings. Let's take a closer look at three stocks the market is snoozing on right now."", 'It may seem odd to kick off this list with Royal Caribbean. The stock has nearly tripled since the beginning of last year, now trading just 2% from the all-time high it hit last week. I still argue that the market is snoozing on the cruise line operator because it should be trading higher.', ""Despite achieving an industry-best 29% revenue growth in its latest quarter and nearly tripling its operating profit, Royal Caribbean shares are fetching just 13 times the midpoint of its recently raised earnings guidance for 2024. The stock's a bargain, trading at a discount to its growth, and the story is even better than its conservative valuation."", ""This is a great time to be a fleet operator. Cruise line stocks may have been dealt the worst hand in the travel industry's poker table when the pandemic hit four years ago, but the major players have more than bounced back. Royal Caribbean's future bookings and customer deposits have never been higher. Margins are widening dramatically. Royal Caribbean is expecting to grow its adjusted earnings by 58% to 61% this year."", ""The money that seafarers are willing to pay for a high-end cruising experience on Royal Caribbean is far outpacing the operator's cost to provide the experience. Looking ahead to 2025 -- with analyst per-share profit targets rising from $11.42 to $12.67 in just the last three months -- Royal Caribbean is trading for 11 times next year's bottom line. Wall Street is sleepwalking on Royal Caribbean, and it's not sleepwalking the plank."", ""If you want a more conventional sleeper opportunity, don't dismiss Chewy's chance to be best in show. The online pet supplies retailer is no market darling these days. It has surrendered half its value over the past year."", ""Growth investors have set aside Chewy as top-line growth decelerates and its base of active customers gradually contracts. It's not a good look for a once fast-growing e-commerce platform to see its once consistent double-digit revenue slow to 8% and then 4% growth in its two latest quarters. The guidance calls for sales growth to be cut in half again, with a 2% showing in the current quarter. Its user base has also declined slightly in back-to-back fiscal years."", 'The future could be brighter as Chewy expands internationally and enters new pet-related businesses. Its more than 20 million active customers are an engaged lot, spending an average of 12% more than they were on the site a year ago. Pet ownership trends continue to be long-term bullish, and Chewy is in a prime position to continue gaining market share.', 'The company behind the unique Sleep Number bed with adjustable firmness settings has been a nightmare for investors in recent years. The shares are down 25% over the past year and a blistering 85% over the last three years.', ""After a dozen years of positive annual revenue growth, the business was rocked in early 2022 when it announced a pandemic-related chip shortage. Most beds don't require semiconductors, but Sleep Number does to monitor the firmness of its air-chambered mattresses. It also has high-end smart beds that monitor sleep and can change temperature, firmness, and elevation settings when sensing discomfort."", ""By the time the chip shortage was resolved, Sleep Number found itself with a bigger problem. Folks weren't buying premium mattresses in a climate with rising mortgage rates freezing the real estate market. Sales slipped 3% in 2022, accelerating to an 11% top-line slide last year. Revenue growth has been negative in eight of the last 10 quarters, including the last five reports."", ""The near-term outlook is still murky. The guidance calls for a third year of declining net sales. The same bedding leader that earned $6.16 a share in 2021 is likely to post an annual loss for the third consecutive year. However, the real estate resale market won't stay depressed forever. Residential transactions should return once the Fed starts lowering interest rates as soon as later this year.

On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This semiconductor maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.26 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -55.5%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $2.1 billion, down 35.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.25% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Analog Devices?', ""For Analog Devices, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.21%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Analog Devices will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Analog Devices would post earnings of $1.71 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.73, delivering a surprise of +1.17%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Analog Devices doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

As new data regulations create a guide for better consumer data privacy practices, and Gen AI transforms how we discover things online, Visa believes that payment data has a role to play in delivering these new and improved experiences - and that consumers should be empowered to have more control too. Using its tokenization infrastructure, Visa will offer a new way for people to control their data and receive better shopping experiences, powered by AI.', 'Visa data tokens let consumers, whose financial institution participates in the program, consent to sharing their data as they shop online, then see where it’s been shared and revoke access right from their banking app. With data tokens, Visa and participating banks can enable an experience where a merchant can request consent from the consumer to get more personalized offers as they shop. If the consumer agrees, behind-the-scenes, Visa issues a private data token to the merchant complete with AI-generated insights based on the consumer’s transaction data. The data token can be used with the merchant’s AI models to deliver real-time recommendations for the shopper. Visa will also pass the data token to the consumer’s bank to capture where the data has been shared, so the consumer can easily review where it has been shared in their mobile banking app and revoke access if they choose.', 'About Visa', 'Visa (NYSE: V) is a world leader in digital payments, facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities across more than 200 countries and territories. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, convenient, reliable and secure payments network, enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.

That doesn't mean it's complete, not by a long shot. But if you have $500 burning a hole in your pocket and you don't mind taking on a little risk, you'll want to examine this iconic toolmaker and Dividend King and its historically high 3.6% dividend yield. Here's why."", ""From a big-picture perspective, Stanley Black & Decker's earnings imploded after reaching record levels in 2021, when people were upgrading their homes as they worked from home because of the pandemic. Back then, adjusted earnings rose 30% year over year to $10.48 per share. Over the next two years, however, the industrial company's adjusted earnings plunged to end 2023 at a much less impressive $1.45 per share."", ""There were a number of problems. The sales boost from the pandemic ended. Supply chains got upended as the world moved beyond COVID, increasing the company's costs. Inflationary pressures also resulted in higher salary expenses. Interest rates started to rise, leading to higher interest costs. And, this is the real lynchpin, a series of debt-funded acquisitions in prior years left the company in a weakened state to deal with all of these problems."", 'Management quickly got to work trying to fix the core issues it faced. That involved selling assets to reduce leverage and strengthen the balance sheet. The company also worked to streamline its business, culling redundant products and combining manufacturing facilities to make better use of its assets.', ""Meanwhile, it undertook a painful inventory reduction process that involved moving higher-cost products through the system even though it meant pressuring operating margins. There's still more to do, but much of the heavy lifting has been completed."", 'In the first quarter of 2024, Stanley Black & Decker reported what would best be described as mixed results. For starters, quarterly adjusted earnings rose from a loss of $0.41 per share in the first quarter of 2023 to a profit of $0.56 per share this year. That is pretty clearly good news, but management tempered that story with an outlook that was less than positive, explaining that ""we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses in 2024.""', ""And yet, at the same time, management stood behind its full-year adjusted earnings target range of $3.50 to $4.50 per share. That's a big reversal from the nadir reached in 2023. And it is backed by ongoing progress the company is achieving in expanding its gross margin. The company expects adjusted gross margin to improve further as the year progresses."", 'The steady improvement in the company margin is what shows that Stanley Black & Decker has probably turned the corner. Meanwhile, it remains a powerhouse in the tool segment, with iconic brands (such as DeWalt, Stanley, Black & Decker, and Craftsman) and an ongoing product innovation platform that is leaning into in-demand cordless products.', ""Stanley Black & Decker's stock price hit a low point in late 2022, since then it has trended largely sideways. Assuming that the company's business continues to improve, however, it could break out of its recent range and start to move higher again."", ""Even if the stock remains moribund for longer, the business appears to be past the worst of the overhaul. So the downside looks like it would be collecting a historically high yield from a Dividend King that's still in recovery mode. Getting paid well to wait for Wall Street to catch on to the improvements taking shape isn't all that bad an outcome."", 'Before you buy stock in Stanley Black & Decker, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Stanley Black & Decker wasn’t one of them.

They have the ability to be reprogrammed using software to allow engineers to change the FPGA's function -- even after the chip has been manufactured and put into use. This makes FPGAs different from application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or even many CPUs and GPUs, which are designed and pre-programmed to behave a certain way."", 'Lattice may be small, but it has been quietly winning a market share battle with its two larger competitors, Intel and AMD. As the semiconductor industry readies for a new growth cycle later in 2024, powered by new needs for artificial intelligence (AI), Lattice could be in an exceptional position to keep winning.', 'When excluding the big data center AI systems that Nvidia is producing, much of the semiconductor industry is actually still in the midst of a cyclical slump. While signs point to the new Nvidia- and big tech-fueled bull market thawing out this downturn, perhaps during the second half of 2024, Lattice just released some disappointing financials for the first quarter of 2024.', 'Metric', 'Q1 2024', '% Change (YOY)', 'Revenue', '$141 million', '(24%)', 'GAAP earnings per share (EPS)', '$0.11', '(73%)', 'Free cash flow (FCF)', '$26.1 million', '(28%)', 'Data source: Lattice Semiconductor.', ""These results effectively bring Lattice's multi-year spate of growth to an end."", 'As ugly as the recent results may appear, though, Lattice is faring far better than the comparable FPGA segments at Intel and AMD. For Intel, that\'s primarily Altera, the big FPGA company it acquired in 2015, and the name of which it recently resurrected with plans to eventually spin it off as a publicly traded company once more. And for AMD, that\'s the ""Embedded"" revenue segment, acquired primarily via the megamerger with FPGA market leader Xilinx in early 2022.', ""Both Intel's Altera and AMD's Embedded segments fell by far more than Lattice's FPGA-focused revenue did to kick off 2024. This means Lattice is scooping up FPGA chip market share at the expense of its two larger peers."", 'Company', 'Q1 2024 Revenue', 'YOY % Change', 'Intel Altera', '$846 million', '(46%)', 'AMD Embedded', '$342 million', '(58%)', 'Data source: Intel and AMD.', ""There's often tremendous value in having singular focus as a business, especially when that singular focus is paired with financial discipline. While Intel and AMD have both struggled to maintain profitability during the chip industry downturn in the last year-plus (Intel much more so than AMD), Lattice has remained profitable by all counts."", 'What\'s Lattice\'s secret? Historically, it has focused on low-end and ""small"" FPGAs, those with fewer logic cells that can be reprogrammed. These small FPGAs are used in things like industrial equipment and sensors, critical applications for things like factory automation and for control of many simple functionality features in modern cars.', 'Lattice has also been moving into mid-sized FPGAs with new product launches in recent quarters. These ""bigger"" FPGAs with more logic blocks are used in more complex functions, like in some parts of data centers, high-end networking and telecom equipment, and more advanced self-driving features in cars.', 'In recent years, in search of better financial efficiency, both Intel and AMD have sunsetted some of their small- and mid-sized FPGA product lines. This has left the door open for Lattice to expand its customer base and sell a broader range of FPGA chips to existing customers once this current industry downtrend is over.', ""It's not just Lattice benefiting either. In its latest earnings call, Microchip also called out Intel and AMD's sunsetting of mid-sized FPGAs, an area of the industry that Microchip has been making waves in."", 'Now, while it may make financial sense for Intel and AMD to try and tighten up their product lineups and cede some share for Lattice, this has a jointly positive effect for Lattice. Less competition means Lattice could sell more and boost its profit margins, too. And, of course, with all sorts of AI applications beginning to proliferate across multiple industries, Lattice small- and mid-sized FPGAs could be more important than ever before.', ""The stock does trade for a premium of nearly 60 times current-year expected EPS. However, bear in mind that includes the steep falloff in earnings in Q1 and expected earnings in the next few quarters as Lattice rallies out of the chip industry downturn.

Finance. Fiscal Q2 2025 ends in late July 2024. Data as of May 15, 2024.', 'The first reason Nvidia looks poised to beat Wall Street\'s estimates has to do with management ""visibility."" Nvidia\'s top management team has said on the company\'s recent quarterly analyst earnings calls that it has good visibility into near-term sales in its data center business. That\'s because the company has a backlog of orders to fulfill due to demand being so strong for its AI-enabling data center chips and related products.', ""Management probably has less of a handle on near-term demand for products in some of its other businesses. But that doesn't matter much because data center is by far Nvidia's largest market platform, and so it drives overall results."", ""The better management's visibility into near-term sales, the better idea it has of its near-term financial results. You can be sure Nvidia's savvy top management team set fiscal Q1 guidance at levels it feels very confident the company will exceed. Wall Street analysts use Nvidia's guidance to help establish their estimates. For many years analysts have underestimated the company's growth potential, and my bet is this dynamic will continue."", ""The second reason that Nvidia's upcoming report -- including from a fiscal Q2 guidance standpoint -- seems poised to be better than analysts expect stems from the recent quarterly reports of several of Nvidia's biggest customers. Companies such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Microsoft are continuing to ramp up their already significant spending on AI initiatives, which is a positive for Nvidia."", 'For instance, Meta now expects its full-year 2024 capital expenditures to range from $35 million to $40 million, up from its prior plan of $30 million to $37 billion. This is due to the company continuing to ""accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap,"" CFO Susan Li said on the Q1 earnings call.', ""Of course, there are no guarantees, but I think it's more likely than not that Nvidia stock will rise after the upcoming earnings release for the reasons just outlined. And there's another possible catalyst: The timing seems good for the company to announce a stock split."", ""That said, if you're a long-term investor, you don't need to concern yourself with trying to time your stock buys. Over the long term, if your bullish thesis is correct for Nvidia, it shouldn't make that much difference if you paid a bit more or less for its stock many years back."", ""Let's look at an example. Nvidia stock closed at $946.30 per share on May 15. Exactly five years ago, the stock closed at $39.90, adjusted for stock splits. If you invested $1,000 in Nvidia stock five years ago, your investment would now be worth $23,717. Had you invested in the stock about five years ago and its price per share was, say, 15% higher than $39.90, or $45.89, your investment would now be worth $20,621. I'm guessing you'd be thrilled to have turned your $1,000 into nearly $21,000 in five years, and not kicking yourself for not doing a little better."", ""A smart way to build your position in any stock is to invest the same dollar amount at regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly. This method eliminates the potential that you'll invest your entire amount at what turns out to be a near-term peak for the stock price."", 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Discovery WBD, among others, to streamline consumer options, retain subscribers and achieve profitability in an increasingly saturated market.With the average U.S. consumer subscribing to four streaming services and spending around $61 per month, according to Deloitte's Digital Media Trends report, retaining loyal subscribers has become a challenge.Apple AAPL, for instance, has been offering Apple One since late 2020. It combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. Disney, which has also been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, both of which merged their respective services last year.While the concept of bundling is not new, the partnership between competing media companies is gaining traction. Bundling multiple services into a single offering aims to provide a more convenient and cost-effective solution for users."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Recently, Comcast announced the upcoming launch of a new bundled offering called StreamSaver. This bundle will combine the company's own Peacock platform with popular services like Netflix NFLX and Apple TV+. Comcast’s forthcoming package is an effort to reduce cancellation rates and provide a more efficient means of subscriber acquisition as the traditional cable TV business continues to deteriorate.The StreamSaver package will be available later this month exclusively for Comcast's broadband Internet customers, ahead of another price hike for the standalone Peacock service, which goes into effect for new customers starting Jul 18 prior to the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games. Beginning in mid-July, the price for Peacock Premium (with ads) will increase by $2 to $7.99 per month and that for Peacock Premium Plus (mostly ad-free) will go up by $2 to $13.99 per month.This strategic move comes amid growing pressure on media companies to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability in an increasingly competitive market dominated by tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet-owned YouTube, among others.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMCSA's 2024 revenues is pegged at $123.16 billion, indicating 1.3% year-over-year growth.

The new bundle will be available for purchase on any of the three streaming platform’s websites and offered as both an ad-supported and ad-free plan.The easiest way to boost revenues is to raise prices, but it comes with the risk of more people cancelling their subscriptions. The lowest-priced Max plan is currently $9.99 a month with advertisements. Disney+ with Hulu is also offered with ads for $9.99 a month.Among other things, the collaborative effort is likely to put the two major comic-book rivals, Disney’s Marvel and Warner Bros.’ DC, together in a cooperative venture, beginning this summer in the United States. Disney+ has more than 100 million subscribers, while Hulu reaches another 50 million. Including the linear version of HBO, Max reaches more than 97 million homes.Earlier this year, Warner Bros. announced a sports streaming partnership with Disney's ESPN and Fox, set to debut later this fall.

Multiple industry sources familiar with the process said FedEx (NYSE: FDX) and UPS (NYSE: UPS), via surrogates, joined Boeing in lobbying Congress for a reprieve from the Jan. 1, 2028, production deadline. The legislation previously passed the Senate and will be sent to President Joe Biden to sign into law.', 'At face value, a split from international consensus would limit operation of freighters produced between 2028 and 2033 to the domestic U.S. market, but it’s possible some countries could permit access, according to experts. Freighters delivered before the end of 2027 aren’t covered by the enhanced carbon emission rules and won’t face any restrictions.', 'Under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreements, commercial aircraft manufacturers effectively can’t sell aircraft that don’t meet the 2028 carbon emissions standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted the fuel efficiency standard in 2021 with the FAA following suit in February.', '', 'Even if post-2027 freighters end up being limited to domestic flying, it makes sense for FedEx and UPS to buy them, said Tom Crabtree, a Seattle-based industry consultant and former Boeing market analyst, in an interview.', '“The 767-300 production and converted freighter provides the lowest trip costs of any widebody freighter in production today while simultaneously allowing service to smaller markets where 50 metric tons of payload, or more, simply isn’t needed. They also have sufficient range to serve international markets to/from Europe and/or northern South America from the US,” he said.', 'Boeing stopped making the 767 as a passenger jet many years ago. It also supplies a tanker variant for militaries. FedEx and UPS are the only customers for the 767-300 freighter. Traditional cargo airlines opt for used 767s that have been converted to a cargo configuration because they don’t have the consistent, daily volumes of integrated express carriers and can’t afford more expensive new models.', 'UPS was the launch customer for the Boeing 767 freighter in 1995. The parcel logistics giant has 88 B767-300s in its fleet, including 10 converted freighters, and 19 additional factory aircraft on order from Boeing.', '', '“We expect to receive all outstanding orders before that time,” said UPS spokeswoman Michelle Polk.', 'FedEx has 137 B767s flying in its network, with 15 more deliveries scheduled through mid-2026, according to the company’s latest statistics.', 'Aviation publication The Air Current was first to unearth the 767 freighter waiver, tucked away on page 1,038 of the FAA bill. The language doesn’t mention the 767 by name, but the maximum takeoff weight of 180,000 kilograms to 240,000 kilograms squarely fits the 767.', 'Boeing officials have increasingly signaled that they plan to develop a freighter version of the 787 Dreamliner as a replacement for the 767F, but the first delivery is expected to take at least eight to 10 years.', '“The 767F continues to be the most environmentally sound mid-size freighter available. We are working with our customers and are in communication with regulators regarding the requirements for this market segment,” Boeing said in a statement before the vote. “As we look ahead to future medium-widebody freighter options, the 787 is a natural place for us to look. We continue to evaluate our options in this space and are listening to our customers. Any future decisions regarding whether to launch a new program, will be largely driven by customer needs and market demand.”', 'Without the exemption, FedEx and UPS could be limited to Airbus A330 converted cargo jets, a model neither currently operates, if they need more medium-widebody aircraft in four or five years. The feedstock for 767 conversions is drying up because passenger airlines like Delta and United are holding on to aircraft longer than anticipated in response to supply chain, manufacturing and engine-related problems that have delayed delivery of replacement aircraft. The airlines probably won’t be ready to let go of the 767s until “they are well beyond the age of conversion or have too many flight cycles and flight hours accumulated on them to make it worth a while to convert,” said Crabtree.', 'The new law will enable Boeing to compete with Israel Aircraft Industries, which installs 767 conversion kits, and an Airbus subsidiary that rebuilds A330s into freighters, and give it time to bring a 787 freighter to market, said the former chief editor of the biennial Boeing World Air Cargo Forecast. And A330 conversion providers would be able to demand higher pricing without that competition.', '“Express firms like the certainty of production freighters even though they are more expensive than conversions of the same airplane models,” he added. That certainty takes the form of more consistent delivery schedules and meeting of specifications.', '', 'FedEx and UPS put pressure on Congress to keep the 767 option open and keep the playing field level until Boeing brings out the 787 freighter, the sources said.', 'Many have interpreted the carve-out to the international fuel efficiency standards to mean that noncompliant aircraft will be prohibited from flying outside the United States. But there is no universal enforcement mechanism. ICAO’s carbon emission standard will be implemented by individual countries as new domestic regulations updating their system for certifying aircraft types. Production will essentially be banned starting in 2028 because noncompliant models will not be certified for sale by civil aviation authorities in their area of jurisdiction.', 'Countries that ban the sale of noncompliant models are likely to ban aircraft with an exemption from entering their airspace on the basis of having an unfair advantage.', 'But an aviation industry source, who didn’t want to be identified because of the political sensitivity of the topic, said FedEx and UPS access to airspace in foreign countries would depend on what individual governments are willing to accept. Smaller countries that typically follow FAA and European Union regulations rather than certify aircraft themselves might have fewer qualms with allowing exempted 767s to operate.', 'Boeing also continues to deliver 777 cargo jets to FedEx and other airlines around the world. The FAA reauthorization doesn’t provide a waiver for the 777 because Boeing expects to have a next-generation 777-X ready sometime in 2027.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.', 'Sign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\xa0', 'Boeing CEO says 787 freighter remains strong candidate to succeed 767F', 'Boeing certification troubles in Canada ground 1st WestJet freighters', 'The post Congress exempts Boeing 767 freighter from 2028 production cutoff appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

The spring RV selling season has seen a boost in the demand for new vehicles at many RV dealerships (the first sequential uptick since 2022 with shipments rising 9%) but the growth of units seems to be focused on the lower-end towable market. While total RV shipments did grow by 9% in the first quarter, all of that growth came from towable RVs (up 15.8%) while larger, more expensive motorhomes that historically have been the biggest market for Expion360’s batteries fell 22% in the first quarter.', 'Revenues were down 36% versus the first quarter of 2023 but did manage to post 13% growth from the fourth quarter when revenues had dipped to just $859 thousand. The company’s core market remains the recreational vehicle and marine markets which are still struggling to find their footing in today’s high interest rate environment. Most RV retailers have cited that affordability rules the day with their customers and Expion360 batteries are viewed as a premium product in the market where price is dominating today.', 'Home Energy ', 'The company highlighted that it released the data sheets for its e360 home energy storage systems on April 30th and they’ve been in discussions with dealers and installers since then to roll the product out to the market. The company’s first two offerings in this market – a DC coupled expandable server rack style system (expandable to 80 kW) and an AC coupled all-in-one 10 kW system (expandable to 40 W) – compare favorably to the industry-leading offering from LG and Tesla (the Powerwall). Many of the technical specifications are identical and the Expion360 product has a lower ticket price.', 'Edge Battery ', 'The company’s management also highlighted a new product for the RV and van market that has been received well by the market due to its unique configuration. The slim profile battery (just 4.2 inches tall) enables users to place a battery in unique spaces that otherwise wouldn’t work for a standard battery. While the market for a product like the Edge Battery is fairly small, we think it will address some of the problems that custom builders have when trying to build battery systems into a living space.', 'Tractor Supply Distribution Agreement', 'Perhaps the most exciting news of the call for investors though was the news that the company has signed a distribution agreement for some of its battery lineup to be offered on the website for Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO). Tractor Supply has annual revenues of $14.5 billion and more than 2,200 retail locations across the country. A quick review of the Tractor Supply website indicates that they do not currently have any LiFePO4 battery offerings and its only storage batteries are gel or lead acid batteries. Given that many of Tractor Supply’s customers may need or want long-term energy storage solutions we think this has the potential to be a very significant deal for Expion360 (particularly if they could get on the shelves of retail locations). We will hold off adjusting our model until we get some hard evidence of sell-through but this is a step in the right direction for Expion360.', 'Operating expenses continue to exceed total revenues as the company invests in the sales infrastructure to target new markets. Expion360 ended the quarter with just $2.3 million in cash after burning $1.7 million in operating activities in the first quarter. With less than 6 months of cash on the balance, it is likely that the company will continue to tap its equity line of credit in 2024 to fund operations which may significantly dilute existing investors (see the financial condition discussion below).', 'Model update', 'We remain concerned that the anticipated bounce back in the RV industry is weaker than hoped and skewing toward lower-end models that often opt for cheaper batteries LiFePO4 batteries or other alternatives like lead acid batteries. These concerns are partially offset by the opportunities available to the company in the home energy storage market and through the new distribution agreement with Tractor Supply. The company is entering its seasonally strongest period for the core RV and marine battery sales but it will be important for investors to see progress by the company establishing distribution and installation partnerships for the home energy storage systems over the next six months. Our 2024 revenue forecast is now $5.9 million which is roughly in line with 2023’s results.', 'We are maintaining our 2025 revenue estimate at $7.6 million but we will revisit that forecast as we progress through 2024 and we believe there is upside to this forecast if the home energy storage market demand accelerates or the Tractor Supply agreement surprises to the upside.', 'Key valuation considerations: ', '1)\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 The sharp downturn in the RV market has been deeper and longer lasting than expected. The company has diversified its product lineup to include Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) and home energy storage and the company’s success in these markets will be a key focus for investors in 2024.', '2)\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 We continue to value the company at 3x 2025 sales - forecast at $7.6 million – for a total market value of $22.8 million. Based on the current share count outstanding (7.45 million) this would produce a target of $3.05/share, but we believe that the share count will continue to grow throughout 2024 ending the year around between 8 and 9 million shares. Until we can get more clarity on the growth of the company’s total outstanding shares after the second quarter is reported, we are going to use the mid-point of that range or 8.5 million shares outstanding at the end of 2024. Thus, our new target is $22.8 million divided by 8.5 million shares or roughly $2.70/share.', 'SUBSCRIBE TO ZACKS SMALL CAP RESEARCH\xa0to\xa0receive our articles and reports emailed directly to you each morning.

In addition, the company has been gaining from the execution of the everyday low-price strategy and reduced transportation, which aided margins in first-quarter 2023.

We often had people asking about other products made by teams so we decided it would be a great idea to showcase all the manufacturing that takes place in the facility and display our shared mission of putting patients at the center of everything we do.', 'JD: Fostering good partnerships with universities is a very important way for us to find and nurture new talent. We work very closely with universities in the West of Ireland to help shape the courses that will generate the next wave of technical skills coming into the sector. Digitalisation is taking place across the manufacturing of the medical technology sector so the knowledge base needs to expand to accommodate this.', 'Overall, Ireland has very strong industry and academia partnerships which will be extremely important in steering companies through the changes that will occur in industry due to digitalisation. At Boston Scientific, we are also putting a focus on forming strong partnerships with data and technology companies to expand our technologies.', 'IDA Ireland is very supportive to us and we work closely to identify ways we can upskill the workforce and also improve our sustainability efforts.', 'JD: Cork is small enough to get around, but the interesting thing is that because of the nature of people, there is a feeling of interconnectedness. People may work across different companies in the region, but they keep in touch and that can be very useful as we have a good working relationship with all the companies in the life science ecosystem.', 'The Cork region is also very affordable for young people and families and we’re seeing a growth in diversity, with more nationalities and cultures arriving to work here which creates a vibrant atmosphere. There are more restaurants and entertainment for people to enjoy so the energy of the city is changing, and the locals certainly appreciate that.', '""Boston Scientific on the importance of positive company culture at Cork facility"" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

(NASDAQ:PEP) and the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) are among the best-known packaged food and beverage companies in the world. In addition, they share quite a bit of similarities, from their target markets to their business models to their financial profiles.', 'But as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. As I will argue below, a closer look at a few key operating and financial metrics suggests that PepsiCo might be the best dividend stock to own.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PEP.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'When it comes to dividend stock investing, the yield is considered by many to be the most important number. Yield is the ratio of the dividend per share payment, usually annualized based on the disbursements made in the last 12 months, by the share price. In other words, yield is what investors get to pocket relative to how much the stock is currently worth in the market.', 'As the chart below depicts, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola yield virtually the same today: 3.10%. The yield is enticing, in my view, even if not stratospheric, beating core PCE inflation by about 30 basis points.', 'Source: Koyfin', ""Notice, however, that PepsiCo has historically and consistently yielded less than Coca-Cola going back at least five years. In my view, this has been the case due to PepsiCo's higher growth and perceived better quality."", 'So despite PepsiCo and Coca-Cola yielding the same today, I believe this is a positive for the former. Simply put, I believe investors now have a chance to own a stock that rarely offers a yield that is better than (or even equal to) its key Atlanta-based competitor.', 'While some dividend investors emphasize (sometimes too much) the yield when deciding which stock to buy, other factors should be considered as well. Dividend growth is one of them.', ""Looking back since the peak of the Covid-19 crisis (see chart below), PepsiCo has increased its per-share dividend payments at a substantially faster pace than Coca-Cola: 10% today on a trailing 12-month basis versus Coke's 5%."", ""All else held equal, investors are better off owning a stock whose company tends to increase the dividend payments over time - and likely will continue to do so going forward. At the risk of oversimplifying the analysis, 10% annual growth in PepsiCo's dividend projected over the next five years suggests a dividend yield of 4.90% by 2029, assuming an unchanged share price. In the case of Coca-Cola, the projected yield would be a less enticing 3.90% assuming the current dividend growth rate of 5%."", 'Source: Koyfin', 'Of course, paying a dividend alone is not enough: the company needs to be able to sustain that dividend payment in the future, if not grow it above the inflation rate at least. This is where financial robustness comes into play.', 'I define financial robustness from two different angles: free cash flow generation and the strength of the balance sheet.', 'In 2023, PepsiCo produced $7.90 billion in free cash flow, a drastic improvement of 41% year over year and 10% annualized from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Last year, the FCF generated was 19% higher than the total dividend payments made. With constant-currency earnings per share projected to rise by 8% in 2024, the dividend payments seem to be well covered.', ""Coca-Cola looks slightly better. While FCF has grown by only 4% per year since 2019, last year's $9.70 billion was 23% higher than the $8 billion in dividend payments made, suggesting a modestly higher dividend coverage ratio."", ""On the balance sheet side, PepsiCo's net debt of $37.1 billion represents a less-than-concerning 37% of total assets. Coca-Cola looks better, with $30.9 billion in net debt adding up to 32% of its total assets."", ""While I believe Coca-Cola wins the financial robustness battle against PepsiCo based on the above, I think it barely does so. In the end, PepsiCo's dividend coverage and balance sheet seem to be good enough to support the yield and dividend payment growth."", 'Lastly, and turning to a more qualitative discussion, I think PepsiCo runs a more balanced, more stable business model.', 'The New York-based company generates about 27% of its revenue and 56% of its operating profits from its snack division (Frito Lay) in North America, which provides better top- and bottom-line diversification. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is almost exclusively a beverage business that, granted, finds slightly better geographical diversification than its key peer.', ""In addition, PepsiCo's business is better distributed across at-home and away-from-home channels, in part due to Frito Lay and Quaker. This helps to explain why its revenues increased by 5% in the first pandemic year, while Coca-Cola saw its sales decline by a painful 11% in 2020 due to the lockdowns."", 'All things held equal, I would rather invest in a company whose business model is better balanced if the goal is to reliably collect dividend payments along the way.', ""While I believe PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are both good dividend stocks to own, I think the former is a better bet today. Supporting the argument are a historically low dividend yield premium that usually favors Coke, PepsiCo's history of increasing the dividend payments more aggressively and PepsiCo's more stable business model, despite Coca-Cola seemingly having an edge over its competitor on financial robustness."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

From that last traded price, I’d like to see NVDA run well above $1,000 a share this year.', 'Strong results from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are also making a bullish case.

These are phenomenal growth rates for a mature blue-chip firm.', 'Intuit also earns a high score in both Portfolio Grader (where it scores a “B”), signaling long-term gains to come.

However, as far as its direct peers are concerned, the only consumer base that features a higher average income is the one undergirding Costco.', 'Second, Target is also better shielded from the yo-yo demand that has put firms like Starbucks on the defensive. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target, and as the saying goes, “we’ve all got to eat.”', 'Finally, InvestorPlace.com’s Will Ashworth writes that Target is one of the few firms that has added significant headcount over the past five years and maintained strong returns on invested capital.

During the last four years, car insurance has soared by 57% to an average annual premium of nearly $2,300, according to Bankrate."", 'Yet there’s no profit windfall like those energy companies enjoy when the price of gasoline skyrockets. Instead, US auto insurers have endured three consecutive years of underwriting losses, which means they paid out more in claims and expenses than they took in through the premiums we pay.', 'These losses totaled $33.2 billion in 2022, according to AM Best, a ratings agency focused on the insurance industry. The underwriting loss narrowed in 2023 to $16.9 billion, but S&P Global Ratings expects another year of red ink in 2024 before premiums once again exceed costs in 2025.', ""The insurance industry overall is still profitable. Auto insurance is only about one-third of all the insurance carriers provide in addition to home insurance and other types of coverage. The industry’s overall profit margin dipped from 10.9% in 2021 to 4.7% in 2022, according to S&P Capital IQ. It may have rebounded to 9.5% in 2023, but that's still below the 11.1% average for the S&P 500 as a whole."", 'So, as aggravating as soaring premiums are for drivers, insurers are largely blameless.', '“They’re not price gouging,” Patricia Kwan of S&P Global Ratings told Yahoo Finance. “What caught the insurance industry by surprise is supply chain issues; there were a lot of shortages, the cost of repairs got more expensive, and labor costs also went up.”', 'Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.', 'The industry’s woes began with the COVID pandemic in 2020, which kinked global supply chains and caused shortages of many goods, including auto parts needed for repairs and new cars themselves. Newer cars are also increasingly sophisticated, with suites of sensors and electronics that are more expensive to repair. The cost of motor vehicle repair has risen 45% in the last four years.', 'Perhaps the most unforeseen factor affecting auto insurance costs has been a jump in fatality rates. There’s been a long-term improvement in auto safety, driven by better technology and other factors. But car crash fatality rates jumped in 2020 due to a variety of potential reasons and have remained above pre-COVID levels ever since.', 'The higher fatality rates indicate that crashes are becoming more severe, pushing up the costs of repair and replacement as well as legal liability. Insurers base premiums on historical patterns and forecasts of future behavior, but when real-world trends bring surprises, it throws insurance pricing models out of whack.', 'In most markets, prices adjust quickly to disruptions. Not in insurance. Most drivers have either a six- or a 12-month policy, so insurers can change a given customer’s price only once or twice per year.', 'Auto insurance is also heavily regulated, with carriers in most states requiring permission to raise premiums above certain levels. It can take months or even years for insurance regulators to allow carriers to raise premiums to levels that cover losses. Those are some of the reasons insurance premiums are only now adjusting to costs that started to rise beyond normal levels at least three years ago.', 'Insurance regulators could try forcing insurers to accept smaller profits by keeping premiums lower. The risk, however, is that insurers will simply withdraw from a given market if it’s not profitable enough, leaving less competition, which could have the adverse effect of pushing consumer costs higher. Florida has struggled with exactly that dynamic in its home insurance market, which has suffered from an exodus of insurers and soaring costs.', 'The good news is that the worst of the consumer price hikes may soon be over. Insurers are cutting costs by advertising less and tightening up other expenses. Loss ratios and fatality rates are improving and car prices have flattened out after surging for three years.', 'Insurers also have an incentive to lower rates if costs allow them to — because people shop around and it costs a lot more to acquire new customers than to keep existing ones.', '“If they overcharge, they lose efficiency and people will start dropping their policies,” Kwan says. “It’s a delicate balance.”', 'Same for drivers trying to afford their cars.', 'Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

The contracts begin January 2025 and run through 2027, with the option to renew for up to two one-year extensions.', 'The earnings impact on plans from the changes will be relatively small, according to analysts, though the contract loss represents a slight challenge for CVS, which could dispute\xa0the decision. On the flip side, the award suggests reprocurement momentum for Medicaid giant Centene, which is coming off recent contract wins in a number of states.', 'KanCare has granted contracts to Centene’s Sunflower Health Plan, UnitedHealth’s United Healthcare Community Plan and Healthy Blue. Healthy Blue is a collaboration of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City and Anthem Partnership Holding Company, a subsidiary of Elevance.', 'The troika launched Healthy Blue in 2021 to make a run at Kansas’ Medicaid contract — a run that has now proved successful.', 'KanCare, however, jilted CVS’ Better Health of Kansas, a plan run by its health insurance business Aetna. KanCare did not specify why Better Health was not selected for the contract. However, Aetna was censured by the state for not complying with the terms of its contract and providing inadequate service in 2019.', 'Aetna also has the highest rate of claims denials out of Kansas’ three managed care organizations, according to KanCare’s annual report to the CMS in 2022, the most recent year the report is available.', 'A CVS spokesperson said the company is “disappointed” with the decision “given the strength of our proposal and the excellent support we provide to our members in the state.”', '“We’re currently reviewing our options,” the spokesperson said.', 'KanCare selected UnitedHealth, Centene and Healthy Blue out of seven bidders, including CVS.

Molina has already said it plans to challenge the decision, while UnitedHealth signaled it would move to protest as well. Molina is also challenging a recent Medicaid contract loss in Virginia.', 'New Hampshire and Michigan also reprocured bids earlier this year, with Centene renewing its contract in New Hampshire. The Michigan awards essentially preserved the status quo in the state, with Centene, CVS, Molina and UnitedHealth reprocuring contracts with minor membership changes.', 'Nearly all states have some form of managed care in place, viewing the arrangements as a way to ensure more budget predictability, while putting plans on the hook for controlling the medical costs of their members.', 'However, divvying out capitated payments also creates an incentive for MCOs to deny or limit medical services to pocket a larger portion of the healthcare dollar.', 'That incentive has underpinned recent concerns about the adequacy of Medicaid managed care plans.

And it isn’t a fad; artificial intelligence will be with us for decades. Let’s highlight some under-the-radar AI stocks to profit from this revolution.', 'Investors have increased their exposure to AI investments as the payoffs of the innovation become clearer. A major focus has been on semiconductor companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and software stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While these industries might still have more upside, the AI impact is likely priced in.', 'Instead, other companies in adjacent industries could have material upside as AI investment goes into overdrive. During Q1 2024 earnings, hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) disclosed increasing their capital expenditures to support their AI efforts.

According to McKinsey estimates, U.S. demand based on power consumption could grow from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 35 GW by 2030.

Therefore, management is confident that they will capitalize on the AI trend.', 'Notably, the company saw 60% organic order growth related to large-scale AI data center projects in Q1 2024. Pipeline velocity surged in the quarter, leading to an $800 million backlog increase, pushing the total to a record $6.3 billion.', 'Due to the robust demand, Vertiv is ramping up production.

Cummings provides a range of power generators that guarantee unlimited operation hours without limit on the average variable load factor. These backup solutions are critical, especially during power grid outages.', 'Due to the robust demand, Cummings posted a 21% revenue increase in the North American power generation segment. Similarly, it revealed accelerating data center demand in the Chinese market.', 'In the Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the robust demand from the data center market.

Firstly, interest rates have reached record highs, with the Federal Reserve not backing down on lowering rates for the short term. This has increased borrowing costs for companies, putting pressure on their profit margins and making it more expensive to fund expansion projects.Also, the U.S. economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2024, with the gross domestic product (GDP) growing at an annual rate of 1.6%. This deceleration from the 3.4% growth rate in the previous quarter was attributed to factors such as a surge in imports, which reduced growth by nearly one percentage point, and businesses reducing their inventories.', 'This puts a negative backdrop in place for these materials stocks to sell, which are also struggling with their poor fundamentals.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'So here are three materials stocks for investors to consider selling in May.', 'Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) faces challenges from a constrained copper supply, which might not keep up with demand, potentially affecting stock performance.', 'However, despite this, FCX reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, showing a total revenue of $7.1 billion, an increase from $6.2 billion in the same period the previous year. The company’s net income for Q4 2023 was $1.4 billion, significantly higher than $224 million in Q4 2022.

(NASDAQ:PEP) and the Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO) are among the best-known packaged food and beverage companies in the world. In addition, they share quite a bit of similarities, from their target markets to their business models to their financial profiles.', 'But as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. As I will argue below, a closer look at a few key operating and financial metrics suggests that PepsiCo might be the best dividend stock to own.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with PEP.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'When it comes to dividend stock investing, the yield is considered by many to be the most important number. Yield is the ratio of the dividend per share payment, usually annualized based on the disbursements made in the last 12 months, by the share price. In other words, yield is what investors get to pocket relative to how much the stock is currently worth in the market.', 'As the chart below depicts, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola yield virtually the same today: 3.10%. The yield is enticing, in my view, even if not stratospheric, beating core PCE inflation by about 30 basis points.', 'Source: Koyfin', ""Notice, however, that PepsiCo has historically and consistently yielded less than Coca-Cola going back at least five years. In my view, this has been the case due to PepsiCo's higher growth and perceived better quality."", 'So despite PepsiCo and Coca-Cola yielding the same today, I believe this is a positive for the former. Simply put, I believe investors now have a chance to own a stock that rarely offers a yield that is better than (or even equal to) its key Atlanta-based competitor.', 'While some dividend investors emphasize (sometimes too much) the yield when deciding which stock to buy, other factors should be considered as well. Dividend growth is one of them.', ""Looking back since the peak of the Covid-19 crisis (see chart below), PepsiCo has increased its per-share dividend payments at a substantially faster pace than Coca-Cola: 10% today on a trailing 12-month basis versus Coke's 5%."", ""All else held equal, investors are better off owning a stock whose company tends to increase the dividend payments over time - and likely will continue to do so going forward. At the risk of oversimplifying the analysis, 10% annual growth in PepsiCo's dividend projected over the next five years suggests a dividend yield of 4.90% by 2029, assuming an unchanged share price. In the case of Coca-Cola, the projected yield would be a less enticing 3.90% assuming the current dividend growth rate of 5%."", 'Source: Koyfin', 'Of course, paying a dividend alone is not enough: the company needs to be able to sustain that dividend payment in the future, if not grow it above the inflation rate at least. This is where financial robustness comes into play.', 'I define financial robustness from two different angles: free cash flow generation and the strength of the balance sheet.', 'In 2023, PepsiCo produced $7.90 billion in free cash flow, a drastic improvement of 41% year over year and 10% annualized from the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. Last year, the FCF generated was 19% higher than the total dividend payments made. With constant-currency earnings per share projected to rise by 8% in 2024, the dividend payments seem to be well covered.', ""Coca-Cola looks slightly better. While FCF has grown by only 4% per year since 2019, last year's $9.70 billion was 23% higher than the $8 billion in dividend payments made, suggesting a modestly higher dividend coverage ratio."", ""On the balance sheet side, PepsiCo's net debt of $37.1 billion represents a less-than-concerning 37% of total assets. Coca-Cola looks better, with $30.9 billion in net debt adding up to 32% of its total assets."", ""While I believe Coca-Cola wins the financial robustness battle against PepsiCo based on the above, I think it barely does so. In the end, PepsiCo's dividend coverage and balance sheet seem to be good enough to support the yield and dividend payment growth."", 'Lastly, and turning to a more qualitative discussion, I think PepsiCo runs a more balanced, more stable business model.', 'The New York-based company generates about 27% of its revenue and 56% of its operating profits from its snack division (Frito Lay) in North America, which provides better top- and bottom-line diversification. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola is almost exclusively a beverage business that, granted, finds slightly better geographical diversification than its key peer.', ""In addition, PepsiCo's business is better distributed across at-home and away-from-home channels, in part due to Frito Lay and Quaker. This helps to explain why its revenues increased by 5% in the first pandemic year, while Coca-Cola saw its sales decline by a painful 11% in 2020 due to the lockdowns."", 'All things held equal, I would rather invest in a company whose business model is better balanced if the goal is to reliably collect dividend payments along the way.', ""While I believe PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are both good dividend stocks to own, I think the former is a better bet today. Supporting the argument are a historically low dividend yield premium that usually favors Coke, PepsiCo's history of increasing the dividend payments more aggressively and PepsiCo's more stable business model, despite Coca-Cola seemingly having an edge over its competitor on financial robustness."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is PEP a Good Investment?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for PepsiCo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $8.16.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for PepsiCo.

That's why they are among the most prominent players in the game."", ""Can Eli Lilly and Regeneron keep this up? Recent developments suggest that the answer is yes. Both companies have announced early positive results for potential groundbreaking therapies for a difficult target: hearing loss. Let's look deeper into these results and their significance for investors."", 'Lilly and Regeneron are targeting deafness caused by variations in the otoferlin gene, which is crucial for proper hearing. Children who suffer from deafness due to this defect can sometimes rely on hearing aids, but approved therapies that can restore hearing due to mutations in the otoferlin gene do not yet exist.', 'In January, Eli Lilly shared early data from a phase 1/2 clinical trial for a gene therapy designed to do exactly that, called AK-OTOF. The pharmaceutical company\xa0reported that an 11-year-old patient, deaf since birth, was administered the medicine and experienced hearing restoration within 30 days of receiving treatment with AK-OTOF.', ""Though that's just data from a single patient, it is already quite an impressive feat. Regeneron's results are also noteworthy. The biotech's candidate, also a gene therapy, is called DB-OTO. Regeneron is running a phase 1/2 study for this investigational medicine."", 'It released results from two patients, one dosed at 11 months of age and the other at four years old.

Probably not. Since these are still early-stage clinical trials, a lot could happen in the coming months and years to derail their plans. Perhaps efficacy data won't hold up. Perhaps safety issues will arise."", ""However, these developments again show these two leaders' innovative potential, a better reason to invest in these stocks."", ""The two are currently benefiting from earlier successes. In the first quarter, Eli Lilly's revenue came in at $8.8 billion, 26% higher than the year-ago period."", 'Unsurprisingly, Zepbound and Mounjaro were the stars of the show.

Both medicines should see their sales grow by leaps and bounds for years to come, driving Lilly's revenue ever higher."", ""The company's lineup also features other growth drivers, such as cancer medicine Verzenio. Lilly's pipeline is solid, too. It could soon earn approval for donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy. The stock has crushed the market in recent years for a good reason. There is plenty of upside left."", ""Turning to Regeneron, the company's two main growth drivers, Eylea and Dupixent, can still generate sales. Although the company's revenue declined by 1% year over year to $3.15 billion in the first quarter, that was due to its coronavirus-related sales dropping. Excluding its COVID-19 antibody, Regeneron's revenue increased by 7%."", 'Eylea treats wet age-related macular degeneration.\xa0Last year, Regeneron earned approval for a high-dose formulation of the medicine that requires fewer annual doses and does not sacrifice efficacy.', ""Meanwhile, Dupixent, a medicine for eczema, is racing toward a major approval in treating COPD, one that should add well over $1 billion in sales to the medicine's total."", ""Regeneron's pipeline is also bright. The company is looking to ramp up its oncology unit and is awaiting approval for linvoseltamab in treating multiple myeloma. It also has what it takes to beat the market over the long run.

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define.

Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. I will now turn it over to Chuck."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Sami, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid performance in Q3, with organic revenue coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Strong operating leverage across our business drove gross margins to exceed the high end of our expectations, resulting in better-than-anticipated earnings per share performance.We once again delivered good growth in annualized recurring revenue, remaining performance obligations and subscription revenue. We have transformed our business model with revenue from subscriptions now accounting for more than half of our total revenue even before the addition of Splunk. With the success of our transformation, we are well positioned to drive long-term growth, powered by innovation across the organization. I want to thank the entire Cisco team as it is through their dedicated efforts that our research and development engine has never been stronger across networking and silicon, observability, security, collaboration and AI. The strength of our core business continues to produce strong cash flows, reinforcing our ongoing commitment to delivering consistent capital returns. In Q3, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends in the quarter with a total of $8.5 billion in value returned year-to-date. Q3 was significant for us in two important ways. First, I couldn't be more excited about the successful close of our Splunk acquisition, Cisco's largest ever. Our acquisition of Splunk was completed midway through our Q3 on March 18, earlier than initially anticipated. Splunk significantly expands our portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing over $4 billion in annualized recurring revenue, and adds to our position as 1 of the largest software companies in the world. We are thrilled to welcome the Splunk team to Cisco and are very excited about what we can deliver for our customers as we integrate our complementary security and observability capabilities. Our unified platform will revolutionize how customers connect and protect their organizations, using data in new ways to enhance their entire digital footprint. Second, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, our most significant new security innovation with a groundbreaking AI-powered approach to highly distributed security, a first of its kind. Combining security and networking in a way only Cisco can, Hypershield is built in the very fabric of the network, bringing the power of hyperscaler security and connectivity to the enterprise. I will talk more about these developments and our innovation momentum in a few moments, but now I'd like to turn to our performance in Q3 and what we're seeing in terms of customer demand. The breadth of our portfolio, together with our many touch points with partners and customers around the world, provides us with differentiated insight into what's happening in our customer base. Based on activations to the cloud, which we track, as well as conversations with our customers and partners, we believe that the products customers have on hand are being steadily deployed in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter, meaning, we currently expect customers to complete the installation of the majority of their inventory by the end of our fiscal year in July. At a time where customers are ruthlessly prioritizing their IT investments, we saw product order growth in two of our largest product portfolios, data center switching and campus switching, as well as product order growth in our security and collaboration product categories. Overall, product orders were up 4% and, excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-on-year. In our customer markets, public sector was strong in EMEA and APJC, but continuing resolution discussions in the U.S. temporarily impacted public sector performance in the Americas. We believe this has since cleared with the subsequent signing of the most recent U.S. federal government funding legislation. While our telco and cable customer demand remained muted worldwide, we are encouraged to see early signs of stabilization and improved performance in web scale in terms of pipeline and orders. Overall, our win rates are stable, and we saw increased strength as we moved through the quarter. This reflects our competitive strength and successful execution and gives us confidence in the long term. We also know that the value of our portfolio is greater than ever as evidenced by recent sell-side research IT spending surveys, which show that Cisco is expected to be the only net share gainer within large network budgets over the next 12 months. Now let's look at our performance in Q3 in more detail. We saw revenue growth in security and double-digit growth in observability year-over-year, excluding Splunk, as customers look to enhance their digital resilience with Cisco's technologies. In the past year, we've accelerated our pace of innovation and security, and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. As I mentioned earlier, last month, we introduced Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed AI-native cybersecurity solution, which will be built into our networking fabric. This new innovation leverages the recently closed Isovalent acquisition to facilitate deployment and software, and the first shipment is scheduled for August this year. This launch furthers our vision for the Cisco Security Cloud, which is expected to deliver the industry's most comprehensive, unified platform with end-to-end solutions, making it easier for our customers to protect against the threats of today and tomorrow. Our newest available security solutions, XDR and Secure Access, continue to ramp quickly with strong customer feedback. Just last week at RSA, we also announced the integration of Cisco XDR with Splunk Enterprise Security, which will give our customers even more value and insights. The closing of the Splunk acquisition in Q3 will also enable us to begin driving revenue synergies in our security and observability markets. Upon closing the deal, we identified 5,000 existing Cisco customers who have the potential to become meaningful Splunk customers, and our sales teams are already making those connections. We also see significant opportunities for revenue synergies by leveraging Cisco's robust partner and customer ecosystem in markets where Splunk had limited or no presence. Earlier this week, Splunk was ranked as the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for security incident and event management, which is a testament to the strength of the offering and the continued business momentum that Splunk has delivered. We are working on a rapid integration, investing in both product integration and go-to-market resources, starting with aligning our Cisco and Splunk sales forces and accelerating channel enablement processes for cross-selling and upselling our combined solutions. We also continue to capitalize on the multibillion-dollar AI infrastructure opportunity. In web scale, we continue to see momentum with 3 of the top 4 hyperscalers deploying our Ethernet AI fabric, leveraging Cisco-validated designs for AI infrastructure. In the past two quarters, Cisco has been granted additional design awards based on our 51.2 terabit G200 Silicon One ASIC. We expect these awards to yield orders in fiscal year '25, reinforcing our confidence in our line of sight to $1 billion of AI product orders in fiscal '25. Additionally, for those leading-edge enterprise customers who seek to be the early adopters of AI, our partnership with NVIDIA will offer easy-to-deploy cloud-based and on-prem networking solutions for AI inferencing. We believe we are well positioned to be the key beneficiary of AI enterprise application proliferation with the breadth of our portfolio and the vast amounts of data we see. Before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to share one more update. Earlier today, we announced that Jeff Sharritts, our Chief Customer and Partner Officer, is departing Cisco, and that Gary Steele, Splunk's former CEO, has been named Cisco's new President of Go-to-Market. Gary is well known for his operational excellence. And in this new role, he will work closely with me to set and execute against our strategic plans and goals for the company. He will continue to lead the Splunk team through the integration process to ensure a seamless integration into Cisco. Gary's operational mindset, combined with his intense focus on simplicity and proven ability to drive growth, position him well in this role, and I look forward to working closely with him in this new capacity. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Jeff for all that he's helped Cisco achieve, which is quite a long list of accomplishments in his 24 years here. Moving back to Q3, let me briefly summarize. While our core product portfolio is trending towards normalization as we continue to see customer deployments of shipped equipment progress, we are pleased that our security and observability portfolios have continued to grow and are significantly enhanced by the acquisitions of Splunk and Isovalent. As our customers adopt and deploy AI, they need the infrastructure to power it, the data to develop it and the security to protect it. And we believe only Cisco can deliver and integrate all 3. With our unified platform approach, vast global partner ecosystem and ability to support hybrid and multi-cloud environments, we will deliver innovation at an unprecedented pace and scale to organizations around the globe. I'll now turn it over to Scott to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Thanks, Chuck. Our Q3 results reflect solid execution with strong margins and a stabilization of orders. Both including and excluding Splunk, our revenue, gross margin and non-GAAP earnings per share were at or above the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Total revenue was $12.7 billion, down 13% year-over-year. Splunk contributed $413 million in revenue in the partial quarter post close. Non-GAAP net income was $3.6 billion, down 14%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, down 12%. The interest cost of financing the Splunk acquisition slightly more than offset the positive operating impact of Splunk. The net effect was a negative impact of $0.01 on non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $9 billion, down 19%, and service revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%. Networking, our largest product category, was down 27%. We saw declines across all geographic segments due to the continued implementation of inventory by our customers. Bear in mind that our Q3 2023 networking revenues benefited from significant shipments of excess backlog. Security was up 36%, including the benefit received from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, Security grew 3% driven by growth in SASE and double-digit growth in our Zero Trust offering. Collaboration was flat driven by growth in our cloud calling and contact center offerings, offset by declines in meetings and devices. Observability was up 27% driven by growth in ThousandEyes network services and the benefit from the Splunk acquisition. Excluding Splunk, observability grew 14% for the quarter. As Chuck said, we have successfully transformed our business model. ARR ended the quarter at $29.2 billion, which increased 22% due to continued strong performance and contribution from Splunk. These factors also drove our product ARR growth of 44%. Without Splunk, ARR was $25 billion, up 5%, and product ARR was up 9%. Total subscription revenue increased 12% to $6.9 billion which now represents 54% of Cisco's total revenue. Without Splunk, total subscription revenue was up 5%, representing 53% of Cisco's total revenue. Total software revenue was up 5% at $4.5 billion with software subscription revenue up 17%. Without Splunk, total software revenue was down 4% and software subscription revenue was up 6%. 91% of our total software revenue was subscription-based. Total RPO was $38.8 billion, up 21%, due to both strong performance and the Splunk acquisition. Product RPO grew 29%. Total short-term RPO was $20.1 billion, up 19%. Without Splunk, RPO was $35.3 billion, up 10%, with product RPO also growing at 10%. Q3 product orders were up 4%. Excluding Splunk, product orders were flat year-over-year. We see customer product implementations progressing in line with our expectations and we expect these deployments to be largely complete by the end of our current fiscal year. Looking at our geographic segments year-over-year. The Americas was up 6%, EMEA was up 4%, and APJC was down 1%. In our customer markets, service provider and cloud was up 10%, public sector was up 6%, and enterprise was up 2%. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 68.3%, up 310 basis points year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 66.9%, up 240 basis points, of which Splunk contributed 70 basis points. The remaining improvement was driven primarily by favorable product mix and lower freight and other costs. Service gross margin was 71.6%, up 430 basis points. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 34.2%, up 30 basis points, driven by our continued commitment to disciplined spend management. Operating cash flow was $4 billion, down 24%. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $18.8 billion. Uses of cash during the quarter included a net outflow of $27.4 billion related to our acquisition of Splunk. In line with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $2.9 billion in value to our shareholders, including $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we've returned $8.5 billion in capital to our shareholders. To summarize, we successfully completed the acquisition of Splunk, drove strong non-GAAP margins, and increased our operating leverage in the quarter. Turning to our financial guidance that includes our integration of Splunk. For Q4, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 66.5% to 67.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to range from 31.5% to 32.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $0.84 to $0.86. Our Q4 guidance includes $950 million to $1 billion in revenue from Splunk and non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.03 as the interest impact more than offsets the operating benefit. In Q4, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18%. For fiscal year '24, our guidance is as follows. We expect revenue to be in the range of $53.6 million to $53.8 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is expected to range from $3.69 to $3.71. We're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19%. Looking beyond Q4 and into our fiscal 2025, in addition to the top line benefits from the Splunk acquisition, there are a few points to bear in mind as you build your models. First, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range next year. Second is the interest impact from the acquisition, which we expect to be a headwind of approximately $350 million per quarter, including both the foregone interest from cash off the balance sheet and the additional interest payments on debt. Third, we're working to quickly integrate Splunk into our product offerings, go-to-market engine, and expect to invest in OpEx in fiscal '25 to drive those revenue synergies. Given these points, we expect fiscal '25 operating margins to be in line with our Q4 guidance. We'll give more formal guidance as we get to the next earnings call, but I want to make sure you have those three thoughts in mind. And as we've stated, we expect the deal to be non-GAAP earnings per share accretive in fiscal 2016 and beyond. Sami, let's now move into the Q&A."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', 'Thank you, Scott. (Operator Instructions) Operator, can we move to the first analyst in the queue.', 'Operator', 'Amit Daryanani with Evercore.', 'Amit Jawaharlaz Daryanani', ""I have two. I'll ask them both at the same time. Chuck, it's really nice to hear about inventory digestion that are being done in order growth, getting back to flat, growing in some of the verticals. Some of the tech companies, I guess, have talked about a softer macro environment that's resulting in some positive spend. I'd love to understand kind of away from the inventory digestion that seems like it's happening, what are you seeing from a macro environment and if that's actually starting to improve as well for you folks? And then if I could just follow up on a different side, the $1 billion of AI orders that you believe you can get in fiscal '25, can you just talk about is these other wins more coming from the Silicon One side or Optical or on the switching solution? Just anything on kind of where do you expect to get these wins would be helpful."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thank you, Amit. I appreciate the questions. So from a macro perspective, what I would say is that ironically, we saw the quarter actually show slight improvement as we move through the quarter. So the end of the quarter was actually a little stronger than the beginning. And look, we obviously believe that our customers now are on track with the inventory digestion that we talked about last quarter. So that's positive. But we saw the Americas, excluding Splunk, was up 2%. So that was a positive sign. And Europe was flat, so that was good. And when you see campus switching and data center switching both positive -- and by the way, data center switching was in the mid-teens growth, so customers are investing in these private data centers, and collaboration being positive, security being high single digits on the order side. But we didn't see any different behavior from our customers during this quarter than we've seen. They still are ruthlessly prioritizing what projects they spend money on, where they spend their IT dollars, but we didn't see any fundamental shift in the macro. On the second question, on the $1 billion of AI, it is largely driven by the web scale infrastructure. As I said, we've got 3 out of 4 that are running our AI Ethernet fabric, and we also had 2 or 3 more design wins during the quarter, I believe, in the back-end networks inside these web scale players. So it's predominantly that. However, we are beginning to see enterprise pipeline materialize, as I said last quarter. So that's really what it's made up of. And it is both systems as well as optics across those customers."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Simon Leopold with Raymond James.', 'Simon Matthew Leopold', ""Great. I wanted to see if you can give us some metrics or some help trying to extrapolate the 5,000 customer opportunity for Splunk. Just give us a better idea of what that could mean from a dollars perspective if you're able to penetrate it.And my follow-up is really, I'm trying to seek a little bit more clarification on this $1 billion AI pipeline because there's been a lot of debate in the investment community regarding it. So I want to see if we can get some clarification that when we talk about the context of what's in there, it's explicitly in the back end that there's not some extrapolation to front-end data center applications. So explicitly back end, and I think, Chuck, you were saying that it is mostly switching in the back end with some optics and some Silicon One. I really would like to clarify this because we're getting a lot of questions."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""All right. Let me answer the second one first, if you don't mind, since I just went on that one. It's $1 billion of orders that we have line of sight to in next fiscal year is what I had said. And on one of the earlier calls, maybe last call, I think I said our pipeline was roughly 3x that we see, but we believe we have good visibility to $1 billion in orders in FY '25. That is primarily back end, and it is a combination of systems that are based on Silicon One, potentially some stand-alone Silicon One, but mostly systems, and then Optics as well. And then we're beginning to see some enterprise use cases, but it's predominantly back end in the hyperscaler space. On the 5,000 customers, we basically did an analysis of where we have -- Cisco has super strong relationships and Splunk doesn't have a presence of 5,000 customers, and we've now mapped those to the sales teams. And Gary, do you want to make a comment on that because you've been involved in that deeply?"", 'Gary L. Steele', ""Yes. So we're excited about the fact that basically, we've identified these 5,000 customers where Splunk traditionally has had no footprint. And the goal there is to have the Cisco sellers open the door for the Splunk team. There's also a financial incentive or SPIFF in place to incent the Cisco sellers to support this activity. And that's one aspect of where we see tremendous opportunity. And then second to that, obviously, there's a lot of overlap in our customers where the Cisco team may have hired more strategic relationships, where they can extend our footprint and insist in helping extend our footprint within the existing Splunk base. And we're already seeing that activity right out of the gate. So we feel like we're off to a very good start, and I'm super encouraged by the level of collaboration we've seen so far."", 'Operator', 'Our next caller is Tal Liani with Bank of America.', 'Tal Liani', ""I'm going to ask my two questions also together, they're linked. You have great motions in security with lots of new products, and you have Splunk introduction to the channel and you have also the AI opportunity for Ethernet. Can you give us a sense of timing? Security grew again only 3% ex Splunk. How long does it take to get all the benefits that you're talking about in these three main areas? Or in general, is it something we're going to see early in '25 or later in '25 or '26? If you can give just a sense of timing of all these initiatives. The second part related to it, if I remove Splunk from the numbers, and you give us enough data to completely remove Splunk from '24 and I can take consensus for '25, then your core Cisco, meaning your initial growth expectations for '25 is about 5% because we need to remove also the backlog contribution this year. So Cisco ex backlog contribution should grow 5%. It's higher than before. So the question is, are you comfortable with Cisco growing 5% next year, give or take? And what is the main component of this growth?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Tal, thanks for the question. So let's go with the first question. I'll say on the organic Cisco security front, you're right, revenue was up 3%. But as I said, our demand was the highest it's been in probably a couple of years, and it was high single digits. So we're seeing the traction on these new products. They're just ramping, right? They're new. Customers are testing. They're implementing. And by the way, a lot of it is ratable. So you take the orders. And like close to 80% of our security portfolio is ratable, so that actually impacts the time for it to transition into revenue. So that's on the security side. But I think on the security and Splunk side, I'll talk about it a little bit, and then I'll let Gary comment on some of the integration. But we announced our first integration last week at RSA. Our intent is just to continue pushing innovation out. We'll have more announcements at Cisco Live. So I think that you'll continue to see that happen. I've always said on the security front, even before Splunk, that we had brought in a new team. We've been building new innovation. The team has built 5 new products and solutions from the ground up over the last 12 months, as you alluded to, just done a phenomenal job, and I had always said that in the second half of '24, I expect that you would see an improvement. And then in '25, you'll see it get to where we really need it to be. And I think that still stands. Do you want to comment on the Cisco, the integration stuff, Gary?"", 'Gary L. Steele', ""You bet. So one of the things I'm super excited about is the progress we've made from an integration standpoint. So last week at RSA, for example, we announced the integration between the Cisco XDR solution and Splunk's Enterprise Security solutions, so bringing high telemetry alerts into Splunk Enterprise Security gives a Splunk customer that much more value in terms of threat detection. And this is just the start of the elements of integration that we can deliver that will ultimately drive growth for the security portfolio broadly, but also Splunk. And as we've described earlier, our integration strategy really is a strong ground game, meaning we want to move the ball 3 yards at a time, and we're going to demonstrate to the industry that we can continue to innovate at a rapid pace as a combined business. And we feel like we're on a really good track to do that."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Gary. And then on your AI timing question in '25, my suspicion is that that's going to start low at the beginning of the year, and it will ramp as we get through the year. So I would be thinking more back half. But we'll have to see how these pilots go. We'll probably know a more in the next 90 days on that. On your second question, first of all, I appreciate the fact that you recognize that several billion of backlog that we cleared last year because '25 will be a year where we're still going to have strange comparisons because we're just still coming out of the tail end of the supply chain situation and this whole digestion issue and the inventory shipments and everything. So '26 over '25 will be the year where we'll really hopefully get back to real apples-to-apples year-over-year comparisons. And while we aren't giving a breakdown today of the FY '25 Cisco or Splunk contribution, we'll obviously have an Analyst Day in June, and we'll go into more detail there. And Scott, do you have anything to add to that? Or is that good?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""No. I think you said it right. Tal, the fact that you recognize the backlog work-off, it clearly is a headwind on just the core Cisco when you look at year-on-year growth rate into fiscal '25. Bear in mind, too, obviously, Q3 was a tough compare. If you remember, we had those 3 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in the mid- to upper teens Q3 of '23 that we're comparing to now, Q4 and then Q1 of this year. And so in addition to doing the year-on-year growth rates the way you're doing it, you need to think of the backlog impact on the year-on-year growth rates in both this quarter, next quarter and again, a tough compare in Q1 of '25."", 'Operator', 'David Vogt with UBS.', 'David Vogt', ""So maybe, Scott, I want to follow up on that line of questioning from Tal. Now I recognize that you have that backlog headwind in '24, but if I just kind of run through what Splunk should be doing versus what they contributed this year, it certainly looks like the backlog headwind is going to cause core Cisco to be down next year. I know you said you're going to hold off on giving numbers. Is that the right math? And so basically, all of the low single to mid-single-digit growth comes from Splunk. And then from a gross margin perspective, obviously, Splunk is going to be a much bigger part of the business, you gave us an operating margin framework, but sort of what do you expect from a gross margin perspective given the stronger margin profile of Splunk, being a bigger part of the business next year versus this year?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. Thanks, David. If you remember, Q1 of this current fiscal year, fiscal '24, was really the last quarter where we shipped a lot of, I'll call it, excess backlog, right? There's always an ambient level of backlog, where we had a lot of excess backlog that built up during the supply constraints. So when you think about the growth rate from '24 to '25, clearly, Splunk is a positive on that, obviously, adding that to it. But you also have to think of this year, fiscal '24, having a nonrepeatable bit of excess backlog that was shipped in the first quarter of this year. Remember, first quarter this year, we grew in the mid-teens on revenue. So if you net that out, that's the math that Tal was doing to say the core business is actually growing in those mid-single digits in fiscal '25. And we can walk through, I know there's a lot of moving parts there. David, we can walk through that if you want. On the gross margins, I think the way to think about that, we had some benefit in the quarter. Splunk itself is a benefit, of course. We had some benefits in the quarter on product mix and some cost savings that I don't think are repeatable longer term. So I talked about the guide for Q4 being gross margins in the 66.5% to 67.5% range for Q4. I think that's the right range as you think about fiscal '25 as well."", 'Operator', 'Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.', 'Meta A. Marshall', 'Maybe first question, Chuck, if you could just kind of update where your kind of conversations with customers are around AI, either in kind of desire to invest on-premise or invest in kind of Cisco security products for preparedness or just impact to budgets.And then maybe second question for Scott, just as we think about kind of the OpEx investment that you guys noted for Splunk, how should we think of that versus kind of original targets to have Splunk be kind of accretive 1 year post close?', 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Meta. I would say the conversations, I think the web scaler is pretty well understood, so I'll talk about the enterprise. And I think most enterprises, there are some that are certainly running pilots that are doing some work today. And we actually had a handful of wins in the enterprise space for infrastructure that was supporting AI build-outs. I'd say they're still very, very, very early. We had our global Customer Advisory Board last week in Canada. And I think we had about 60 customers there, and they're all still trying to figure out exactly what their use cases are and how the architecture is going to play out. So I would say it's still super early on the enterprise side. Did you want to add something, Gary?"", 'Gary L. Steele', 'No.', 'Charles H. Robbins', 'Go ahead, Scott.', 'Richard Scott Herren', ""In terms of the way to think about the OpEx comment that I made, we talked, Meta, when we announced the acquisition of Splunk, that this is much more driven by revenue synergies than cost synergies. There's no question there will be cost synergies as we work our way through this. But we will spend from this point through fiscal '25 ensuring that we get both the product integration right, the organizational integration right. We have to do channel enablement. We have to train their sales team on Cisco, train the Cisco sales team on Splunk. There's investment that goes along with that integration. And this fiscal '25 is the year we'll do that.We said in the first year post acquisition that we would be accretive in cash flow, and we will. That we'll be accretive in gross margin from Splunk, and we will. And that we'll be accretive in earnings per share in the second year, so think of that as fiscal '26. I know this closed a little bit early, and I think there's this perception that it closed 6 months early, so those times ought to be accelerated. We thought the acquisition would close around the end of our fourth quarter. It closed around the middle of our third quarter. So round numbers, it was a little more than a quarter early. So I think the way to think about that is EPS accretive in fiscal '26 but still being cash flow and gross margin accretive in fiscal '25 as we invest in the integration."", 'Operator', 'James Fish with Piper Sandler.', 'James Edward Fish', ""I did want to double-click on Meta's question here because this is serious ramp on the OpEx side to get really earnings going down again in '25, if my math is right, somewhere around $3.50 a share. Can you elaborate a little bit further as to why it's going to go be that much? Should we be expecting revenue synergies starting in fiscal '25 with that initial kind of low to mid-single-digit growth rate? Or is that just going to take too much time, another year or so, to really get? And not to layer on the question here, but is some of the OpEx ramp due to the conversion of stock-based comp of Splunk to cash comp? Historically, Splunk and Cisco have had two totally different philosophies on compensation."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. Thanks, Jim. On the OpEx ramp, I know the Splunk team didn't put out guidance for this fiscal year, but you can look at where their OpEx was headed and layer that into the OpEx that we had. There is some growth year-on-year. There's some investment. It's not a substantial ramp-up, though, in the investment on integration. It's more a question of just pulling the Splunk team together with ours. As I said, there will be some cost synergies, they're likely to come more in the second half of the year. But this wasn't a deal that was motivated by cost synergies. It was much more motivated by revenue synergies. What you said, I think, is spot-on. We will see those revenue synergies begin to ramp in the second part of fiscal '25 as these are not short sales cycles, as we get our team ramped up on how to sell Splunk, as we get the Splunk team ramped up on how to sell Cisco, and as we get our channel fully enabled to sell that. So yes, you're going to see those revenue synergies, but you'll need to think about them more in the second half of the year."", 'Gary L. Steele', ""Yes. And I think the revenue synergies that we're focused on really are driven around the 5,000 accounts that we talked about earlier. The sales cycles on those are 6 to 9 months, and so you're not going to see that immediately, but that work is happening. And we're also seeing tremendous collaboration across the organization where our sales teams are working together to more broadly penetrated accounts. I think you'll start to see that in the first half, but it's going to layer in. You're going to see more momentum as we get to the middle part of the year."", 'Operator', 'Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.', 'Samik Chatterjee', ""I have a couple as well, if I may. I know you're talking about the deployments with your customers, enterprise customers being higher than what you're shipping to, and that implies you'll take a step-up in terms of revenue when that inventory digestion ends. I was just curious on sort of the order trends. You had mentioned you'll be back to a normal seasonality of orders, maybe more in fiscal '25. But how close are you seeing sort of order trends return on a sequential or quarterly basis to more normalized sort of seasonal trends? Is that pointing you in any direction in terms of whether that gap between deployment and your orders are starting to sort of compress?And for the second one, just a quick follow-up on the AI order, the $1 billion sort of target here. Just trying to understand if you feel like you need 1 or 2 more big wins in terms of customers or land and expand with the existing ones should be good enough to get you to that $1 million target that you have?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', 'Scott, do you want to take the sequential one?', 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. Well, on the enterprise deployments, we are seeing that progress, Samik, and one of the things that's been encouraging, and we've given you some of the data on this, is where we see it moving more quickly, we talked about WiFi and how our wireless business is growing, where the enterprise deployments of all the product that was pushed out has progressed more quickly, we're seeing demand return. Normal seasonality, if you're talking about year-on-year growth rates, is a lot tougher, right? You've got to get to a point where you actually have a normal quarter, which we're headed toward now once we get through this inventory consumption at the end of this quarter, and then you have to lap it by a year. To get to a year-on-year compare, that's an apples-to-apples compare. So think of the normal seasonality in terms of year-on-year growth rates beginning much more in fiscal '26. From a sequential standpoint, you'll see that start to happen in the second half of fiscal '25."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""And then on the AI, the $1 billion that we talked about, those are actually identified opportunities that our teams have a high degree of confidence. We didn't set a $1 billion target and tell people to go find deals. They're deals behind the $1 billion, and they're actual wins that we either have already won or we have a high degree of confidence that we will win. There's certainly execution that has to occur between now and when we get them done. We have to get through the pilots. There's a lot of testing that has to take place. There's power consumption testing that goes on. So a lot of that is going on. But based on what we know, this is what our teams believe today. So this is not some aspiration that we have to go find. These are opportunities that have been identified that our teams feel good about."", 'Operator', 'Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.', 'Matthew Niknam', ""One question, one small follow-up, and I think this has been the theme of the call. On the main question, actually for Scott, you've got leverage now that sits just under 1 turn, but the business now has a greater mix of recurring revenue, more visibility that, that naturally lends itself to. So I'm just wondering how you think about optimal leverage for the business and uses of excess cash from here? And then just on the follow-up, as we think about low to mid-singles growth next year, well aware of the backlog and the tougher comp that, that creates in fiscal 1Q of next year. Just as we unpack the networking assumptions, are you assuming normal demand and purchasing cadence returns next year once inventories have been digested? Or is there any incremental caution that's embedded there from a macro perspective?"", 'Charles H. Robbins', 'Scott, do you want to take the first one?', 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes. I'll talk about cash first, Matt. And yes, we moved obviously, with the acquisition of Splunk. And this data is out there. We raised about $13.5 billion of term debt that's out there. And we actually funded a lot of it with some cash off the balance sheet but also with commercial paper, with the expectation that as rates come down, obviously, commercial paper is a more real-time reflection of those lower rates, so it's a way of saving money on that. Moved to a net debt position for the first time certainly in my career and probably the first time here at Cisco, probably the first time in the last 2 decades here at Cisco. The use of cash, though, we talked about Splunk being cash flow accretive in its very first year, which is highly unusual for a transaction of this size. It will be. And so our capital allocation process is not going to change. And just to reiterate what it is, first and foremost, it's to support growth. Right behind that, if that's 1, 1A is, of course, continuing to support the dividend, and you see we've continued to grow the dividend on a year-on-year basis. Return cash to shareholders through share buybacks, that's been at a steady $1.25 billion per quarter for the last now several quarters. We'll continue to do that. And to the extent that we've met those three and there still is excess cash, we'll determine whether it makes sense to take that cash and delever or if it makes more sense to return that to shareholders at that time."", 'Charles H. Robbins', ""And Matt, on the demand normalization, based on what we see today, I think we would expect, starting in Q1 and beyond, we should see that normalize, obviously, with the caveat that there's a lot of hotspots around the world. There are a lot of potential risks out there that are happening. We've got elections all over the world and the most important one perhaps in the United States. So we're certainly going to have to see how all of this plays out. But so far, based on what we see, I think that's a decent assumption for FY '25."", 'Operator', 'George Notter with Jefferies.', 'George Charles Notter', ""I guess I wanted to ask about gross margin impacts from the inventory digestion. As we look around the space, we've seen companies use tools like stock rotation or rebates to try to push inventory through the channel. Sometimes that can certainly have an impact on margins. Are you guys seeing any of that in the gross margin results right now?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""No, we're not, George. There's very little inventory in the channel that is something that we continue to own. In other words, when we ship into the channel, it's sold at that point. There's very little stocking that happens inside our channel. So we're not seeing that benefit. What we are seeing is, of course, we've put in place the price increases to help offset the higher costs that we saw coming through the supply chain constraints, and we've lapped those. So there's actually a little bit, you'll see when our Q comes out, a little bit of pricing headwind back to the normal, what it had been kind of pre-pandemic, but big benefits, of course, with the product mix of Splunk coming in and some one-off things that we benefited from during the quarter."", 'Operator', 'Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.', 'Ittai Kidron', ""I had a question for Gary. I guess, off the press, Palo Alto just announced its acquisition of the SIEM business from IBM. Exabeam this morning announced the merger with LogRhythm. So it seems like the market you're operating in is moving at a very fast pace at consolidation. Maybe you can talk about the competitive landscape for your business. And why should we not assume that pricing pressures are going to significantly rise in this environment as everybody is trying to fight for footprint?"", 'Gary L. Steele', ""Yes. No, great question. There obviously is a lot of activity in this particular market. One of the things that we feel very good about, and Chuck referenced in his prepared remarks earlier, is our position in Gartner's Magic Quadrant where we stood out as the leader in the SIEM market. So we have a very strong established market position and our pace of innovation has fundamentally changed over the last couple of years. We continue to deliver very interesting innovative capability that we think is very high value.So for example, last week at RSA, we announced what we call Splunk Asset and Risk Intelligence. This is a critical capability to help organizations do self-discovery of assets across their environment and then understand the risks associated with those things. Coupled with that, we're now getting the broad benefit of the Cisco Security product line where we can bring in interesting capabilities like the integration with the XDR solution that we also announced. So we feel like while yes, it is competitive, we feel like we're incredibly well positioned to continue to drive very important innovation. And we've also taken a very different approach than our competitors, and we think broadly about how do you bring together on a single platform the security capabilities that customers want broadly all the way through observability. And it's very difficult across the industry to see anybody taking the position that we have and driving value. With respect to pricing, we don't have any fundamental change in our pricing strategy. We're very much focused on driving very good adoption across our customer base and ensuring that they feel like they're getting value every day. and the capabilities that we're offering are hard to match in the industry. So we're not shifting gears from a pricing point of view."", 'Operator', 'Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.', 'Benjamin Alexander Reitzes', ""In the spirit of the two, I wanted to ask, if we take, I would say, $1 billion to $2 billion of the hit from inventory in 2025 from the prior question, I just want to make sure that I heard it right that you underwrite that the real industry growth, the real networking growth, is in that mid-single-digit range that was mentioned in a prior question.And then if that's the case, I guess this is the second one, then does it mean at your Analyst Day, we'll hear more about how 2026 could be a higher single-digit growth business for Cisco overall? I mean you're mixing towards Splunk and software and therefore, the math would have you guys, on a normalized basis, after the organic growth is very muted in 2025, accelerating by several hundred basis points to the higher single digits in 2026, if that's true. Be happy to repeat any of this, but hopefully, you were able to follow that."", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Yes, I got it, Ben. And you're asking me now for fiscal '26 guide at the same time. Is that the right takeaway? Just kidding. You're thinking about it right. The underlying business, the core business of Cisco, net out the benefits of the Splunk acquisition when you look at fiscal '25, but also when you take '24, net out the impact of the excess backlog that we shipped early in fiscal '24, mostly in Q1, a small amount in Q2 as well, and you get to that mid-single-digit growth of the core business that we've had. So I think you're thinking about that right. We will talk more. I'm not going to do it on this call, but we will talk more about fiscal '26 and beyond at our Investor Day in June in Vegas. So hopefully, I'll see you there."", 'Operator', 'Atif Malik with Citi.', 'Atif Malik', 'The first one is for Gary. Gary, Splunk has been using AI/ML for the last 1.5 years with natural language assistant, SPL, and also event detection and response. Can you big picture talk about how Cisco data will improve your AI capabilities?', 'Gary L. Steele', ""You bet. And so if you look at the history with Splunk, we were very early driving capabilities with machine learning. We launched the MLTK package in 2017, and we've had 0.25 million users on that. So there's been broad adoption. We then extended that when we brought gen AI into the picture, delivering an SPL assistant, SPL being our proprietary search language, being able to use English to be able to do that. We're also bringing AI directly into the workflow. So think about SOAR as an example and how you can bring AI into the picture to drive better outcomes from a remediation point of view. So we've been investing across the product line. You're going to hear and see more announcements from us over at Cisco Live as well as at our user conference, which follows Cisco Live. And the benefit that we're getting, bringing it into Cisco is, Cisco has independently been making a whole set of investments. We get to leverage those assets in addition to the richness of data that we get. So where we benefit from Cisco is the broad, rich data sets that exist across networking. So think lateral movement, how can we leverage that data to do a better job from a detection point of view. And frankly, the data and insights that we have as a combined entity, I think, are second to none in terms of the competitive environment. So we just basically accelerate our AI efforts as part of Cisco and the outcomes we can deliver to be really important."", 'Operator', 'Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.', 'Michael Ng', ""I just have two as well. First, I think that the guidance this year implies 34% EBIT margins. You commented that fiscal '25 can look like the guide for fiscal 4Q. I think it's about $1 billion of OpEx investment. So I was just wondering if you could kind of qualitatively talk about where most of those OpEx investments will lie. And then secondly, last quarter, you characterized the fiscal '24 guidance as conservative, I believe. How would you characterize your initial financial outlook for fiscal '25?"", 'Richard Scott Herren', ""Okay. Michael, thanks for the question. The year-on-year, again, I think what you're struggling with on the fiscal '25 look is expectations if you just straight added where the run rate of Cisco spend to what your expectations are on the run rate of the Splunk spend. And I'd say a couple of things to bear in mind. There's some onetime benefits that we had this year in our OpEx for the core Cisco pre-Splunk acquisition, frankly, in our variable comp plans which has been a tough year, and we've come up short of our plan. And so there's some savings in variable comp for this year in fiscal '24 that obviously, I don't plan on repeating those in fiscal '25. Obviously, we'll do a merit increase as well. So there's some small increase that is just kind of the reset of the comp plans and ongoing merit. There is some investment as well in the integration, but it's not even approaching the number with the quick math that you just did. So that's kind of the way to think about that piece. Now if you look at the guide for next year, kind of how would I say it. What I'd say about the guide for next year is I feel, with a lot of the tailwinds that we're seeing right now, so let's just go back, consumption of all of the inventory that we ship to customers that they were working very hard to get implemented is going in line with our expectation. We think we work our way through that headwind, mostly by the end of this quarter, our fourth fiscal quarter, that's a tailwind for next year. Obviously, the AI opportunity that we've talked about being more second half of fiscal '25, but for the full year, that's a tailwind as we look ahead. Security business is doing what we said it's going to do, right? We've launched new products there even before the acquisition of Splunk, and those products are getting good traction. So that's a tailwind as we look at next year as well. So I think all in all, I feel like it's kind of a down-the-middle view of fiscal '25 at this point. It's not a formal guide. I just wanted to give you a sense of what that looks like, and we'll give you a better feel for what the longer term looks like at our Investor Day in June, and then we'll give you a more fulsome guidance when we get to our Q4 call in August."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', 'I now want to hand over back to Chuck for some closing remarks.', 'Charles H. Robbins', ""Thanks, Sami, and thanks to all of you for spending time with us today. I guess I'd say I'm pleased that we're getting to the tail end of this supply chain situation that we've been navigating for the last several years, on track to get this consumption issue behind us as we enter FY '25. Feel good about the overall demand environment we saw in Q4, which supports the fact that our customers are getting this digestion done. As we look to the future, we obviously are optimistic about AI, both from an infrastructure perspective, a data perspective as well as a cybersecurity perspective. Security, in general, we believe will continue to improve and obviously, we're super excited about the Splunk integration, and we're committed to deliver for both our customers and for you. Also I just want to quickly thank Jeff Sharritts for everything he's done at Cisco and also that we're very excited to have Gary taking on the new role here, and thank you all for being with us today."", 'Ahmed Sami Badri', ""As a reminder, we will be hosting our 2024 Investor Day as part of Cisco Live on June 4, 2024.
