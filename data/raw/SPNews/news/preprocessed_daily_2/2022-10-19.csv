But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) shareholders have seen the share price rise 65% over three years, well in excess of the market return (18%, not including dividends).While this past week has detracted from the company's three-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. View our latest analysis for Charles Schwab While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Charles Schwab was able to grow its EPS at 6.9% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Charles Schwab's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Charles Schwab's TSR for the last 3 years was 72%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Charles Schwab shares lost 15% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 10%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term.

7,4cc6bbb7-d42a-3e06-95e7-208c06c7b227,SCHW,2022-10-19,Is Schwab Small-Cap Index (SWSSX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-small-cap-index-swssx-110011290.html,1666090811,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Are you on the hunt for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? You should think about starting with Schwab Small-Cap Index (SWSSX). The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWSSX. Since Schwab Small-Cap Index made its debut in May of 1997, SWSSX has garnered more than $5.54 billion in assets. The fund is currently managed by a team of investment professionals.PerformanceOf course, investors look for strong performance in funds. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 3.63%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. But if you are looking for a shorter time frame, it is also worth looking at its 3-year annualized total return of 4.35%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Over the past three years, SWSSX's standard deviation comes in at 25.52%, compared to the category average of 24.62%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 22.85% compared to the category average of 22.3%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 1.13, so investors should note that it is hypothetically more volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. The fund has produced a negative alpha over the past 5 years of -5.38, which shows that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.HoldingsExploring the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is principally on equities that are traded in the United States.Story continuesCurrently, this mutual fund is holding 99.23% stock in stocks, which have an average market capitalization of $3.09 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:FinanceIndustrial CyclicalTechnologyTurnover is 8%, which means, on average, the fund makes fewer trades than its comparable peers.ExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWSSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.04% compared to the category average of 0.79%. Looking at the fund from a cost perspective, SWSSX is actually cheaper than its peers.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.Bottom LineWant even more information about SWSSX?

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.14%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.12%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.05%.Texas Instruments will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 25, 2022. On that day, Texas Instruments is projected to report earnings of $2.37 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 14.49%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $5.11 billion, up 10.16% from the year-ago period.TXN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.35 per share and revenue of $20.08 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +13.2% and +9.44%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Texas Instruments is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Texas Instruments is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 16.15. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 8.89, so we one might conclude that Texas Instruments is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesWe can also see that TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.73. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. TXN's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.69 as of yesterday's close.The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 207, which puts it in the bottom 18% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

9,eb7b1faf-97ab-372d-b68f-ff84afd1d58f,TXN,2022-10-19,STM or TXN: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stm-txn-better-value-stock-154003180.html,1666107603,STORY,"['TXN', 'STM']","[Investors interested in stocks from the Semiconductor - General sector have probably already heard of STMicroelectronics (STM) and Texas Instruments (TXN). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than TXN has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.STM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.18, while TXN has a forward P/E of 16.15. We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 1.64. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.73.Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P/B ratio of 2.82. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TXN has a P/B of 9.79.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help STM earn a Value grade of A, while TXN has been given a Value grade of C.STM stands above TXN thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that STM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

10,47d237a6-6535-34ea-a0ac-ff0db3533a1a,RRC,2022-10-19,Matador Resources (MTDR) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/matador-resources-mtdr-reports-next-140102103.html,1666101662,STORY,"['MTDR', 'RRC']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Matador Resources (MTDR) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +109.6%.Revenues are expected to be $765.18 million, up 62% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11.22% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Matador?For Matador, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Matador will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Matador would post earnings of $3.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.47, delivering a surprise of +9.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Matador doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, Range Resources (RRC) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +169.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.07 billion, up 252% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Range Resources has been revised 8.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.43%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Range Resources will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As of December 31, 2021, it had 193 outlet stores, 107 retail stores, 373 company-operated stores, 73 kiosks and store-in-stores, and 14 company-operated e-commerce sites. The company serves in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Crocs, Inc. was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Broomfield, Colorado.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.For CROX, I see four straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is great to see, but by itself that is not enough to make the company a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The average positive earnings surprise over the course of the last year works out to be 21%.Story continuesEarnings Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher.Over the last 60 days, earning estimates have moved up for ELF.This quarter has dropped by a cent to $2.57.Next quarter has also fallen by a penny to $2.17.The full fiscal year 2022 has increased from $10.06 to $10.04.Next fiscal year has seen the estimate move from $10.83 to $10.68.Positive movement in earnings stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).ValuationThe valuation for this name is somewhat mixed. I see the forward earnings multiple works out to be 7.7x and that is very low for a name that has posted topline growth of 50% in the most recent quarter. Price to book comes in at 9.7x which is a little high.Bear of the Day:Brady is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) but it could be worth a deeper look even as estimates have moved lower. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in this Bear of the Day article.DescriptionBrady Corporation manufactures and supplies identification solutions (IDS) and workplace safety (WPS) products to identify and protect premises, products, and people in the United States and internationally. It also offers stock and custom identification products, as well as sells related resale products. Brady Corporation was incorporated in 1914 and is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Earnings HistoryWhen I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.In the case of BRC, I have two beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, one meet and one miss. This alone does not make the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it doesn’t make it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) either.The Zacks Rank does care about the earnings history, but it is much more heavily influenced by the movement of earnings estimates.Earnings EstimatesThe Zacks Rank tells us which stocks are seeing earnings estimates move higher or in this case lower. For BRC see annual estimates moving lower.The current fiscal year consensus number moved from $3.45  to $3.30 over the last 60 days.The next year has moved from $3.40 to $3.35.Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).It should be noted that a majority of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions. That means that the stocks that are seeing small but negative earnings estimate revisions are falling to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Additional content:Natural Gas Stalls 8th Straight Week, Still Up Big Year-to-DateThe U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a larger-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies. The negative inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures fell for the eighth week in a row to settle at its lowest level in almost three months.Despite this, the market has been kind to natural gas in 2022, with the commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $10 for the first time since 2008. Natural gas stocks like EQT Corp., Comstock Resources and Range Resources have been some of the prime beneficiaries of the price appreciation.EIA Reports a Build Larger Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states rose 125 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Oct 7, exceeding the guidance of a 123 Bcf addition per the analysts surveyed by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.The increase was also well above last year’s injection of 86 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net build of 82 Bcf.The latest increment puts total natural gas stocks at 3,231 Bcf, which is still 126 Bcf (3.8%) below the 2021 level at this time and 221 Bcf (6.4%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 105.4 Bcf per day, down 1.1 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to a dip in dry production (from its record level) and lower shipments from CanadaMeanwhile, daily consumption rose 1.8% to 91.3 Bcf from 89.7 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a stronger power burn and increased residential/commercial demand.Natural Gas Logs its Eighth Straight Weekly FallNatural gas prices tumbled last week, following the higher-than-expected inventory build. Futures for November delivery ended Friday at $6.453 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling around 4.4% from the previous week’s closing. The decrease in natural gas realization — for the eighth straight week — is also the result of a boom in supplies and the prediction of mild ‘shoulder season’ weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. The latest models anticipate light temperature-driven consumption over the near term (with little use of air conditioning or heater across much of the Lower 48), which is a negative for prices.An increase in natural gas production has also kept the commodity in check. With the upstream operators finally responding to price incentives and ramping up volumes in the last two months, daily production has topped or hovered around 100 Bcf in recent weeks. This wave of new supply is expected to largely neutralize concerns that the market might enter the winter withdrawal season with gas in storage well below normal. Having said that, current inventories are still pretty tight and remain more than 6% below their five-year average.The one thing supporting natural gas is a stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere. Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe squeezed following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out most of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart in November. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Final ThoughtsDespite posting an eighth straight down week with combined losses of around 30% during this period, the natural gas market is still up almost 75% so far this year. As one would expect, the loss in momentum since mid-August has also pushed gas stocks down. However, certain companies like EQT, Comstock Resources and Range Resources have handsomely benefited from the windfall from higher natural gas prices year to date.EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with a primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has an expected earnings growth rate of 365.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EQT’s 2022 earnings has been revised 12.3% upward over the past 60 days. EQT — valued at around $15.2 billion — has soared 88.6% n this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Comstock Resources: The company is active in the Haynesville shale in North Louisiana and East Texas — a premier natural gas basin. Currently, a Zacks #2 Ranked stock, CRK has a projected earnings growth rate of 231.9% for the current year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Comstock Resources’ 2022 earnings has been revised 10.6% upward over the past 60 days. CRK shares have surged around 113.9% so far this year.Range Resources: The upstream firm has a strong footing in the prolific Appalachian Basin. In the gas-rich resource, RRC has huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.Range Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of 167.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) natural gas player’s 2022 earnings has been revised 1.3% upward over the past 60 days. RRC shares have climbed 51% year to date.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Our 5 best-performing strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's impressive +28.8% gain in 2021.

13,3b851df4-dfa7-3533-8060-b2424cd5dce9,NUE,2022-10-19,Nucor (NUE) Gears Up for Q3 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nucor-nue-gears-q3-earnings-130301878.html,1666098181,STORY,"['NUE', 'X', 'KOP', 'ALB']","[Nucor Corporation NUE is set to release third-quarter 2022 results ahead of the bell on Oct 20.The U.S. steel giant surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missed once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.1%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of around 8.5% in the last reported quarter. The company is likely to have benefited in the third quarter from continued strength in the non-residential construction markets. However, weaker prices are likely to have hurt its results.Nucor’s shares are up 19% over a year, compared with the industry’s 20.6% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What do the Estimates Say?Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the third quarter. It anticipates third-quarter earnings to be between $6.30 and $6.40 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $10,059.3 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 2.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter average sales price per ton for the company’s steel mills unit stands at $1,248, suggesting a 6.8% year-over-year decline and a 12.7% sequential decrease.A Few Factors to WatchThe company’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect weaker steel prices. However, its steel products segment is expected to have benefited from continued strong demand in non-residential construction markets.Nucor, in September, said that it expects earnings to decline significantly in the steel mills segment on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter. The expected decline is due to metal margin contraction and lower shipment volumes, especially at its sheet and plate mills.The company also expects its steel products segment to deliver another strong quarter, with earnings roughly in-line with second-quarter 2022. Earnings for the raw materials unit are forecast to be flat on a sequential comparison basis in the third quarter.U.S. steel prices have witnessed a significant downward correction. After surging to nearly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, the benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices have retreated and fallen below the $800 per short ton level. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. Mills are also negotiating lower prices for new orders. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices.Lower selling prices are likely to have weighed on Nucor’s steel mills segment in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continues Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Nucor Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNucor Corporation price-eps-surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Nucor this season.

The bottom line was 9% lower than the prior-year level. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was $1.77 per share.Shares of STT rallied almost 4% in pre-market market trading on better-than-expected quarterly performance. Also, the company’s plan to repurchase shares worth $1 billion in the fourth quarter cheered investors.Results reflected new investment servicing wins (bringing servicing assets to be installed in the future to $3.4 trillion), higher net interest revenues (NIR), a slight fall in expenses and growth in net interest margin. Also, the company recorded no provisions during the quarter. A decline in fee revenues hurt STT’s results to some extent.Results excluded non-recurring items. After considering those, the net income available to common shareholders was $669 million or $1.80 per share, down from $693 million or $1.96 per share in the year-ago quarter. We had projected net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) to be $647.4 million.Revenues &amp; Expenses DeclineThe total revenues were $2.96 billion, decreasing 1% year over year. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.98 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $3 billion.NIR was $660 million, surging 35.5% year over year. The rise was largely driven by higher global interest rates and growth in loan balances. The net interest margin (NIM) rose 35 basis points year over year to 1.11%. Our estimates for NIR and NIM were $619 million and 1.11%, respectively.The total fee revenues declined 8.2% to $2.30 billion. The fall was due to a decline in servicing fees and management fees. We had projected total fee revenues to be $2.32 billion.The non-interest expenses were $2.11 billion, down marginally. This reflected continued productivity and optimization savings and gains from currency translation, largely offset by continued business investments and a rise in wages, marketing and travel costs. Our estimate for the metric was $2.16 billion. Excluding non-recurring items, expenses were $2.1 billion, relatively stable.The provision for credit losses was nil in the reported quarter against a provision benefit of $2 million in the prior-year quarter.The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.2% as of Sep 30, 2022, compared with 13.5% in the corresponding period of 2021. The return on common equity was 11.2% compared with 11.6% in the year-ago quarter.Asset Balances DeclineAs of Sep 30, 2022, the total assets under custody and administration (AUC/A) were $25.7 trillion, down 17.7% year over year. The fall was due to lower equity and fixed-income market levels, previously disclosed client transition and unfavorable currency translation partially offset by net new business wins.The assets under management (AUM) were $3.3 trillion, down 15.5%, reflecting lower equity and fixed-income market levels and institutional net outflows, partially offset by ETF and cash net inflows.Our TakePersistently rising expenses due to the company’s strategic buyouts and investments in franchise will likely hurt the bottom line to an extent. A tough operating backdrop is another major concern for STT.State Street Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | State Street Corporation QuoteState Street currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Other BanksBank of New York Mellon Corporation’s BK third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10. The bottom line represents a rise of 11% from the prior-year quarter.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline, which was a negative. Also, higher expenses hurt BK’s results to some extent.Higher loan balance, rising rates and solid markets performance drive JPMorgan’s JPM third-quarter 2022 earnings of $3.12 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.97.

Our estimate for earnings was $2.98 per share.Disappointing IB performance, bigger reserve build and increase in operating expenses hampered JPM’s quarterly performance to some extent.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.68%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.94, delivering a surprise of 10.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.State Street Corporation , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, posted revenues of $2.96 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.73%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.99 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.State Street Corporation shares have lost about 31.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.8%.What's Next for State Street Corporation?While State Street Corporation has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for State Street Corporation: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.77 on $3.03 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.07 on $12.04 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Major Regional is currently in the bottom 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 19.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.82 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.1%.

It is worth considering Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry.This maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.75%.For the last reported quarter, Thermo Fisher came out with earnings of $5.51 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.92 per share, representing a surprise of 11.99%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $6.17 per share and it actually produced earnings of $7.25 per share, delivering a surprise of 17.50%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Thermo Fisher lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thermo Fisher currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.98%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 26, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

CDW, W.W. Grainger GWW and Cintas CTAS.4 GARP Stocks to Scoop Up for Maximum ReturnsGrowth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent strategy to earn quick profits from investments. The GARP approach helps identifying stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.Therefore, a portfolio created on the basis of the GARP strategy contains stocks that offer the best value and growth investing. Carlisle Companies, CDW Corp., W.W. Grainger and Cintas are some GARP stocks that hold promise.GARP Metrics — Mix of Growth &amp; Value MetricsThe GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Story continuesValue MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Carlisle is engaged in designing, manufacturing and selling a wide range of roofing and waterproofing products, engineered products and finishing equipment.

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.18%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.16 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of -1.72%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, posted revenues of $1.56 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.4 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Shares have lost about 47.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.8%.What's Next for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.While Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The company beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met estimates in one and missed once, the average negative surprise being 0.48%.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCritical CareEdwards Lifesciences is likely to have gained from the continued demand for its state-of-the-art HemoSphere monitoring platform. As economies return to pre-pandemic levels, amid ongoing COVID-19 concerns, the increased hospital visits are likely to have benefited HemoSphere sales, thus adding to the top line. In the prior quarter, the company’s portfolio of Smart Recovery sensors and TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices supported the increased number of patients in the Intensive Care Unit. We believe this trend to have continued in the third quarter, benefiting the segment’s results.Our model shows a 4% year-over-year decline in Critical Care revenues in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $209 million, implying a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Surgical Structural HeartEdwards Lifesciences is likely to have gained from the increased penetration of the company’s premium RESILIA products. Edwards Lifesciences has seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the United States since its initial launch in April. Based on the commercial success of INSPIRIS, as well as the benefits of the innovative RESILIA tissue technology, Q3 revenues within this segment are expected to have been strong for Edwards Lifesciences.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEdwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteStory continuesHowever, sales headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain noncore cannula products, as well as the COVID shutdown in China, combined with the ongoing staffing shortages in healthcare and inflationary pressure, are expected to have marred revenues significantly.Our model shows a 3.5% year-over-year decline in Surgical Structural Heart revenues in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $219 million, implying a decline of 0.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors at PlayWithin the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) arm, the company is likely to have witnessed continued growth in TAVR procedures across the United States and worldwide. Despite the ongoing industry-wide challenges like U.S. hospital staffing constraints and foreign exchange headwinds, the company is expected to have reported sales growth in this business based on focused R&amp;D. For full-year 2022, it expects R&amp;D expenses to be between 17% and 18% of sales as it develops new product pipeline and generates evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. This is likely to have boosted production and sales in Q3 within this business.Further, with the ongoing rebound in treatment rates, given the abating effects of the pandemic, the company is likely to have witnessed robust uptake of the SAPIEN platform, as it did in the previous quarter.The company’s Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies segment’s PASCAL platform is likely to have maintained strong growth momentum in Q3. This rally is expected to have been driven by the growing body of clinical evidence for PASCAL in the tricuspid position. Further, the company continues to make meaningful progress in enrolling its TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE system.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.34 billion, suggesting a rise of 2.1% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter 2022 net earnings of 62 cents indicates 14.8% growth from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates. This is exactly the case here as you can see:Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.81%.

He said the state had not offered any evidence that Walgreens dispensed any prescriptions without ""legitimate medical purpose.""Reuters watched the proceeding via Courtroom View Network.When the non-jury trial began six weeks ago, it also included claims against Walmart Inc and Kroger Co, but those companies settled with the state last month. The terms of those settlements have not been disclosed, and the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.The U.S. opioid crisis has caused more than 500,000 overdose deaths over two decades, according to government data. More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed, mostly by local governments, accusing drugmakers, distributors and pharmacy chains of fueling the crisis.Major drugmakers and distributors have collectively agreed to pay tens of billions of dollars to settle opioid cases against them, but pharmacies have yet to strike a nationwide deal.Two cases against pharmacies have been tried to a verdict.One, brought by two Ohio counties, resulted in a jury verdict against Walgreens, Walmart and CVS Health Corp last year, and a judgment of more than $650 million last month.Story continuesThe other, brought by San Francisco against Walgreens, resulted in a judge holding the company liable in August. A second phase of that trial to decide on a money judgment is scheduled for next month.Walgreens and CVS also settled mid-trial with Florida for $683 million and $484 million, respectively. Walmart and CVS settled with West Virginia last month for $82.5 million and $65 million, respectively, a week before a scheduled trial.Walgreens is scheduled to face trial in West Virginia next June.(Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Comcast (CMCSA) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.91 a share nine days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 27, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.91 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.89 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Comcast has an Earnings ESP of 3.04%.CMCSA is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Under Armour (UAA) as well.Under Armour, which is readying to report earnings on November 1, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

That is, there were more number of shares purchased by insiders than there were sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Marsh &amp; McLennan CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Marc Oken bought US$837k worth of shares at a price of US$167 per share. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of US$156. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Marc Oken was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below.

PLD is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 19 before the bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on three occasions and missed on the other, the average beat being 0.71%.This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayDespite economic headwinds and uncertainty and recession woes in the third quarter, U.S. industrial market fundamentals remained strong and steady, per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, with “heightened levels of absorption” and rents scaling new highs.There was a net absorption of 108.2 million square feet (msf) of space in the September-end quarter, a level consistent with strong demand. It marks the eighth straight quarter where absorption surpassed the 100 msf mark. Moreover, the new leasing activity reached 163.1 msf in the third quarter.The U.S. industrial vacancy rate remained “tight” at 3.2%, denoting a 20-basis point (bps) quarter-over-quarter uptick. Moreover, each region in the United States once again reported vacancy rates sub-4%, with the lowest being the West region at only 2.5%.With elevated demand and high occupancy rates, rental rates continued to scale to new heights. The U.S. overall industrial asking rental rate ended the third quarter at $8.70 per square foot, denoting a 4% sequential increase and a 22% annual surge. It marked the strongest year-over-year growth rate recorded, per the CWK report.Prologis is well-poised to benefit from this favorable trend, given its capacity to offer modern logistics facilities at strategic in-fill locations. PLD is anticipated to have witnessed healthy demand on the fast adoption of e-commerce, with leasing activity getting support in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, with global supply chains transforming for faster fulfillment and resilience, Prologis is likely to have captured favorable fundamentals with its differentiated customer offerings and robust investment activity in the to-be-reported quarter.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Prologis has decent balance sheet strength to fuel its growth endeavors. A market leader, this REIT has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.13 billion, suggesting an 8.9% year-over-year jump.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share of $1.72 calls for a 65.4% increase year over year.However, with the asset category being attractive, there is a development boom in many markets. Per the CWK report, development activity picked up pace in the third quarter, with 148.2 msf of industrial facilities being delivered throughout the United States, the highest quarterly total on record.Also, the industrial construction pipeline reached another all-time high of 716.9 msf in the third quarter, 2.6% ahead of the previous high a quarter ago. The high supply is likely to have intensified competition during the September-end quarter.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Prologis does not have the right combination of two key elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an FFO beat.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is -2.47%.

(NYSE:XYL),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-xylem-inc-175102839.html,1666115462,STORY,['XYL'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Xylem Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$581.2mUS$686.1mUS$768.1mUS$885.0mUS$970.9mUS$1.04bUS$1.10bUS$1.15bUS$1.20bUS$1.24bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 9.71%Est @ 7.39%Est @ 5.77%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.84%Est @ 3.28% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$544US$601US$630US$680US$698US$701US$695US$680US$661US$639(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.5bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$26bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$26b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$13bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$90.6, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Xylem as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.036. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Xylem, there are three pertinent elements you should further research:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Xylem   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does XYL's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Notably, all the bank releases so far have one thing in common – support from higher interest rates and improving loan demand. This resulted in a solid increase in net interest income (NII) and an expansion in net interest margin (NIM). Also, banks guided for further improvement in NII for the year driven by favorable rates and lending scenario.Basically, growth in NII was the only reason the banks were able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. Similarly, several other industry players might also be able to post an earnings beat this time.As finding such stocks from the vast universe of the banking industry can be daunting, we are using our proprietary methodology to find such picks easily. By using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified three S&amp;P 500 banks -- Comerica Incorporated CMA, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated HBAN and Zions Bancorporation ZION -- that are poised to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter.These stocks have the ideal combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Key Factors to Impact Q3 ResultsWe all know that the financial performance of bank stocks is considered one of the barometers of the nation’s overall health. As economic growth gained traction, the overall lending scenario improved during the third quarter. This, along with higher interest rates, is expected to have majorly supported banks’ NII growth.Now coming to fee income, on geopolitical and macroeconomic economic concerns, the operating backdrop became challenging for banks to drive up non-interest income. Thus, fee income, which had been a source of key support to banks’ revenues during the pandemic ear, is expected to have recorded dismal performance in the third quarter.On the cost front, increased investments in technology to boost digital offerings, business streamlining efforts, initiatives to expand into newer areas and inflationary pressure resulted in higher operating expenses.Now coming to credit costs, deteriorating macroeconomic outlook and higher loan balance led the banks to set aside a large amount as reserves. Thus, banks are expected to have witnessed higher provisions for loan losses in the third quarter.Story continues3 Potential Safe BetsComerica, which delivers financial services in three primary regional markets – Texas, California and Michigan – as well as Arizona and Florida, is a leading banking and financial services provider. A robust lending scenario and rising rates are expected to have supported the company’s NII. Management is anticipating NII (including PPP) to increase 21% sequentially.Further, Comerica’s focus on revenue-enhancing initiatives is likely to have resulted in an improvement in operating efficiency. CMA is scheduled to announce third-quarter numbers on Oct 19.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $2.57 indicates a jump of 35.3% from the year-ago reported figure. CMA has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseComerica Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseComerica Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteHuntington Bancshares, a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company, provides a range of banking services and products. As commercial loans constitute a major part of the company’s loan portfolio, it must have gained from improved demand for such loans during the third quarter.Further, boosted by higher short-term rates, improvement in the lending scenario and increased average earning assets, the company’s asset yields, NIM and NII are anticipated to have been bolstered. However, the industry-wide disappointing performance of fee income is also likely to have hurt Huntington Bancshares’ non-interest income, while the recently closed acquisitions (Capstone Partners and Torana) might have offered some support.HBAN is scheduled to announce results on Oct 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share implies a rise of 8.6% from the year-ago reported figure. HBAN has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% and a Zacks Rank #3.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteZions is a diversified financial service provider, operating a widespread network of more than 400 branches. The company’s footprint spans 11 western states, namely Utah, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon and Wyoming.Similar to Comerica, Zions has significant exposure to commercial loans. Thus, this along with higher rates, is expected to have aided the company’s NII and NIM in the third quarter. As the company plans to reduce overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees, management expects total customer-related fees to decline almost $5 million in the third quarter.On the cost front, expenses are likely to be increased due to inflationary pressure. Zions is slated to announce results on Oct 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.58, implying an increase of 9% year over year. ZION has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #3.Zions Bancorporation, N.A. Price and EPS SurpriseZions Bancorporation, N.A.

The president is prepared to authorize significant additional sales in coming months if conditions require, the fact sheet noted.This represents a major step for the administration but not a new strategy. As GOBankingRates previously reported, the Biden administration first tapped the reserves in November 2021, then followed that in March 2022 by ordering the release of 1 million barrels of oil a day for six months. That was the largest release from the reserve in its nearly 50-year history.The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil — its lowest level in four decades.Earlier this year the Energy Department said it was planning a new method of buybacks to permit a “competitive, fixed-price” bid process as an alternative to index pricing.Another potential move is putting temporary limits on exports of fuel so more gasoline and diesel will remain in the United States, but a decision on that is not expected before next month’s midterm elections.The administration’s decision to tap into more of the emergency reserve follows a recent announcement by OPEC and its oil-exporting allies to reduce oil production by 2 million barrels a day to boost prices.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?Explore: 4 Ways the Fluctuation of Gas Prices in 2022 Affects YouMeanwhile, the national average gasoline price hit $3.854 a gallon as of Oct. 19, according to AAA.

Any move by the cartel influences prices, and that pressure is felt by Biden ahead of the November midterm elections.Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatCome winter, more oil sales could be on the table “if needed due to Russian or other actions disrupting global markets,” the White House said.By the digits180 million: barrels authorized for release by Biden back in March have now been exhausted with the latest 15 million36%: how much the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) has declined by since Biden took office400 million: barrels of oil left in the US strategic reserve—the lowest since 198419.89 million: barrels of oil the US consumed daily in 2021, suggesting the 15 million release won’t even satiate one day’s appetite2 million: barrels a day OPEC+ cut back on$3.854: national average gas price—high, but still lower than the June peak of $5$67 to $72: the price at or below which the US government will restock the strategic reserve12 million: daily US oil production, 1 million shy of pre-pandemic levelsQuotable“This repurchase approach will protect taxpayers and help create certainty around future demand for crude oil. That will encourage firms to invest in production right now, helping to improve U.S. energy security and bring down energy prices that have been driven up by Putin’s war in Ukraine.” —White House statementUS foreign policy slips on oilThe 23-nation oil cartel maintains that its decision is purely economical. Several national leaders that form the group have publicly backed this intent.However, the US is convinced there’s a political sheen to it. After all, Russia, whose February invasion of Ukraine wreaked havoc in worldwide oil supplies, stood to gain the most from the decision as it could enjoy higher prices at its already-low output.Story continuesBiden’s rebuke of big oilOil prices aren’t only affected by SPR releases. Market forces, recession fears, and reopening of refineries under maintenance all play a part in the cooling off, too.And in addition to releasing reserves and replenishing stock, there’s another way to bring prices down: taking from the deep pockets of oil giants. Biden has called on companies to pass on lower energy costs to consumers “right away”:The profit that energy refining companies are now capturing on every gallon of gasoline is about double what it typically is at this time of year, and the retailer margin over the refinery price is more than 40 percent above the typical level. These outsized industry profit margins–adding more than $0.60 to the average price of a gallon of gas–have kept pump prices higher than they should be. Keeping prices high even as input costs fall is unacceptable, and the President will call on companies to pass their savings through to consumers–now.The US’ alternative energy planIn 2020, fossil fuels accounted for 79% of total energy consumption in the US. But Biden still plans to move to the US to a 100% clean economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.However, the transition won’t be without hiccups. Alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind, and ethanol remain less popular because they’re more expensive and less efficient. Nuclear energy faces its own set of restrictions.Related stories🛢️ Where does the US stash its strategic oil reserves?🏷️ The EU’s gas price cap treads a thin line between flexible and chaotic🤑 Even Shell’s CEO admitted taxes on energy companies are a way to deal with inflation]"

Two of them were due to be decommissioned on March 31, 2023.Finland - Finnish utility Fortum plans to add 560 megawatt (MW) of capacity to the Nordic power market after October by reactivating an idle coal-fired power plant on the country's west coast.France - The Emile Huchet coal power plant restarted in early October, only six months after it closed, according to local media.Germany - Germany's cabinet passed at the end of September two decrees to prolong the operation of sizeable hard coal-fired power plants and bring back idled brown coal capacity to boost supply and network reserves.The Economy Ministry said bringing back coal-fired power plants into the mix could add up to 10 gigawatts of capacity in case of a critical gas supply situation.Greece - National gas grid operator DESFA said in September Greece will keep seven coal-fired plants running for longer than previously planned, citing the current energy crisis.Italy - Among a raft of measures to help cut gas consumption, Italy plans to increase output from existing coal-fired and oil-fired power plants.Story continuesNetherlands - Dutch energy minister Rob Jetten said in June the Netherlands will remove a production cap at coal-fired energy plants to preserve gas.North Macedonia has delayed the closure of its coal-fired power plants Bitola and Oslomej to 2030 and plans to open two new coal mines to supply power stations.Poland - The country suspended in September a ban on the use of lignite — the most polluting type of coal — for heating homes until April 2023 to ease the supply crisis. In June, it said it plans to ""increase thermal coal production from existing mines this year maximum by 1.5 million tonnes"".Serbia is increasing coal production due to insufficient rain for hydro-electric plants. Serbia's Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) expects a new unit at its Kostolac power plant to come online by 2023, according to local sources.Spain - The ministry for the ecological transition requested in May the delay of Endesa's As Pontes coal power station closure. In September, it authorised the conditional closure of two of the plant's four groups, ""taking into account the reinforcement of power availability variables"".UK - Britain's National Grid signed contracts with power generators Drax Group and EDF's EDF Energy to extend the life of four coal-fired power units at two plants.The available capacity will only be used a last resort to ensure security of supply if needed. Germany's Uniper said in September it would prolong the lifespan of its Ratcliffe coal power station.Ukraine - Although most of Ukraine's mines are in the Donbas region, seized by pro-Russian forces, the country is planning to increase domestic stocks of thermal coal from 2 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes ahead of winter.(** Note that Ukraine's government has stopped releasing coal production data since the start of the war).AFRICABotswana - The government has estimated that demand from Europe could reach more than 50,000 tonnes a month.South Africa - European countries, scrambling to secure alternatives to Russian coal, imported 40% more coal from South Africa's main export hub in the first five months of this year than over the whole of 2021, figures obtained by Reuters showed.Tanzania expects coal exports to double this year to around 696,773 tonnes, the country's Mining Commission told Reuters, while production is expected to increase by 50% to about 1.365 million tonnes.ASIA &amp; OCEANIAAustralia - Australian resources and energy export earnings are forecast to jump 7% to a record A$450 billion ($290 billion) this fiscal year. Australian coal has increasingly headed to Europe instead of India since mid-2022 after European sanctions were imposed on Russian coal over its invasion of Ukraine.China - Beijing approved 15 gigawatts of new coal-fired power capacity and another 30 million tonnes of coal-based iron-making capacity in the first half of this year.Research from Greenpeace East Asia shows that provincial governments across China approved plans to add a total 8.63 gigawatts of new coal power plants in the first quarter of 2022 alone.Indonesia - The world's biggest exporter of coal has said it can increase output to help meet demand from countries that have lost supplies from Russia.AMERICASColombia - The government said this summer it could increase coal and petroleum production as it steps up to fill the void created by sanctions against Russia.United States - Several U.S. states, including Indiana, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nebraska, have announced the delay of planned closures of their coal-fired plants, until as late as 2025, citing concerns about energy shortages among other issues.(Reporting by Dina Kartit; Editing by Nina Chestney and Jan Harvey)]"

We've already heard from several of the major banks. Goldman Sachs the latest to report its quarterly results, coming out with a beat. But how did these big banks compare to one another in the latest quarter? Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova here with me at the desk. We got all the big banks out of the way. In general, a pretty positive outlook-- I don't know if we should say positive outlook, but a beat. The expectations were fairly low.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. I have to start out by saying it's really been a mixed bag for financials, as they've been reporting their results. On one hand, the banking industry is still doing just fine, compared to what analysts are expecting to see from some other sectors that are set to report in the coming weeks. It's really just the year over year comparisons that have been really tough after an incredibly lucrative 2021. And they're still meeting analyst expectations for the most part.But on the other hand, we are seeing bank profits taking a huge hit, driven primarily by two things-- lower dealmaking activity that is really putting a dent in investment banking revenues and them setting aside funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect the possibility of an economic recession.But there are a few, of course, that have held up better than others. Goldman Sachs, yet again, was a standout today, beating on all fronts, coming in far better than Wall Street had expected. Profit was down 43%, but that was partially offset by an 11% jump in trading activity, led by fixed income trading specifically. So again, the expectations were low, and this was very much a better than feared situation with the big banks.Story continuesBank of America also posted a drop in profits year over year. However, it did see an earnings per share beat compared to what Wall Street was expecting. Also benefiting from better than expected trading revenues.AKIKO FUJITA: So those are kind of the winners, as you put it. The biggest loser?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, one more winner we have, JPMorgan actually saw a drop in quarterly net income. But Oppenheimer analysts said it was a blowout quarter, saying that blowout would be an understatement because analysts were really preparing for the worst when it came to this. But then you look at Citigroup. Citigroup profit fell 25%. Revenue, however, rose 6%. Again, it beat Wall Street estimates.Morgan Stanley was the only bank that really disappointed Wall Street, missing expectations and reporting profit that fell 29%. So that was one of the banks that saw a much more challenging quarter compared to its peers.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, Alexandra Semenova with the roundup for us. Thanks so much for that.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.65 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.93%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this advertising company would post earnings of $1.56 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.68, delivering a surprise of 7.69%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Omnicom , which belongs to the Zacks Advertising and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $3.44 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.97%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.44 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Omnicom shares have lost about 7.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.8%.What's Next for Omnicom?While Omnicom has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Omnicom: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments.Definitions - Components of Revenue ChangeWe use certain terms in describing the components of the change in revenue above.Foreign exchange rate impact: calculated by translating the current period's local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue. The foreign exchange rate impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue.Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue: Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition date is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of disposals through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the description above.Organic growth: calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact component and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue component from total revenue growth.Conference CallOmnicom will host a conference call to review its financial results on Tuesday, October 18, 2022 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

73,e1c8a302-5aed-3033-8afc-ca9420088cca,FE,2022-10-19,FirstEnergy (FE) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firstenergy-fe-expected-beat-earnings-140102269.html,1666101662,STORY,['FE'],"[FirstEnergy (FE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis utility company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -6.1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.19 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for FirstEnergy?For FirstEnergy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that FirstEnergy will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that FirstEnergy would post earnings of $0.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.53, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.FirstEnergy appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 3.7% loss over the past four weeks.The upswing came after the activist hedge fund Starboard Value founder Jeff Smith revealed buying stake in the enterprise software maker during an interview with CNBC’s David Faber. Smith didn’t disclose the dollar amount during the interview but stated that the stake is significant.This customer-management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.7%. Revenues are expected to be $7.82 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Salesforce.com, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on CRM going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

They rose between 2.3% and 4.6% on Tuesday.""We need to appeal to the management team to be as competitive at producing value for shareholders,"" Smith said of Salesforce, noting it had market-leading positions among all of its products and a highly competitive culture.""They win in the marketplace. We need them to win for shareholders. That's why we're involved.""Smith was detailing the thesis of his most recent investments at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit on Tuesday.On Salesforce, Smith said Starboard had been engaging with its management team in ""recent months"" and that the new executives - including co-CEO Bret Taylor, who is also chairman of the board of Twitter Inc and was promoted to his Salesforce role in November 2021 - were better focused on balancing growth aspirations and profit delivery.However, recent targets unveiled by Salesforce would still translate into performance similar or below that promised by peers, even though Salesforce had much greater scale.Why is Salesforce trading at just 10 to 12 times free cash flow per share with peers at 20 to 25 times, Smith said, adding he sees ""tremendous upside"" for the share price.Story continuesStarboard is among the industry's busiest activist investors and has had a high success rate of placing directors onto corporate boards, often in settlements with the company.On Wix, in which Reuters revealed last month Starboard had built a 9% stake, Smith said he welcomed a cost-cutting program which the company has already announced but said things can improve even more above the company's target of reaching 20% free cash flow margins by 2025.""We expect Wix to need to target greater than 25% margins, which would make it possible to reach a more appropriate growth plus profitability target of 40 plus percent,"" Smith said.At Splunk, Smith said he and his team are enthusiastic about the company's new CEO, Gary Steele, and look forward to ""better execution"" saying that the there is room to push for operational improvements.""We think there's significant upside at Splunk,"" Smith said, noting the company could boost free cash flow margins and maintain strong growth profile that could allow Splunk to generate eight to $9 of free cash flow per share by 2025.He added that, as well as growing profitability, Splunk's business made it highly attractive as a potential acquisition target. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that Cisco Systems Inc made a $20-billion offer for Splunk, and Smith said there have been other suitors in recent years.""This dynamic creates multiple ways to win and makes the investment in Splunk even more interesting,"" he added.

Per the latest figures, the consumer price index showed that prices in the country during the month of September were 8.2% higher compared to prices over the same period last year. The rate represents yet another decline for the benchmark inflation index in the months following June. The inflation rate had peaked at over 9% in June, the highest in nearly four decades. Due to aggressive rate hikes by the central bank to tame inflation, investors have been pulling money from the stock market to invest in less riskier ventures, pushing the US towards a recession. Benchmark market indexes like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading in the red since the past few months. They have registered year-to-date declines of 22%, 31%, and 16%, respectively. The chaos is spreading to global markets in the meanwhile as well. However, this slowdown has created several buying opportunities at the market where prominent names like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are all trading at discounted prices due to the overall macro uncertainty. Investors can pick up the shares of these businesses at bargain rates and since the bear market is expected to wind down in the coming months, these stocks could be the first to rally as the economy recovers. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the S&amp;P 500 were selected for the list.

More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128     Apple Inc.

This, along with reduced lease, drab retail sales and a decline in early purchase options, is likely to have been concerning.However, the company has been witnessing strength in its e-commerce platform, driven by increased investments in digital marketing, improved shopping experience, same-day and next-day delivery services, the personalization of products, and a broader assortment, including the latest product categories.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Ralph Lauren (RL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.08 a share 23 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 10, 2022.RL has an Earnings ESP figure of 0.08%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.08 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07.RL is just one of a large group of Consumer Discretionary stocks with a positive ESP figure. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on November 7, 2022, Take-Two Interactive holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.43 a share 20 days from its next quarterly update.Take-Two Interactive's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 4.68% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37.Story continuesRL and TTWO's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The company beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 2.43%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayTotal Clear AlignerAlign Technology is likely to have gained from increasing clear aligners shipments to Invisalign doctors worldwide. The company, in the last reported quarter, witnessed a greater uptake of clear aligners, especially among first-time customers. Analysts expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, aiding sales growth.Strong potential exists, particularly in the teen segment, with an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases in the past few months. Further, Invisalign First for kids has been gaining market share rapidly across all regions. We are also optimistic about Align’s recently-introduced Invisalign Teen Packs to have registered strong performance in the United States, Canada and France in Q3.Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlign Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlign Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteThe other latest Invisalign innovations for the Align Digital Platform, including the ClinCheck Live Update, the Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personalized Plan, Invisalign Smile Architect and the Cone Beam Computed Tomography integration feature for ClinCheck digital treatment planning software, too are likely to have fortified Invisalign utilization.As the economies around the world return to normalcy amid COVID-19 concerns, we anticipate Invisalign case volumes to have rebounded across the Americas and international regions. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q3. Further, staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q3.Story continuesOverall, our model shows a 2.6% year-over-year decline in total clear aligner revenues in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clear Aligner revenues is pegged at $803 million, suggesting a 4.2% drop from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services BusinessAlign Technology is expected to have gained from robust iTero scanner services revenues as it did in the previous quarter. The company has been witnessing continued growth in the iTero scanner installed base, with strong adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system. This growing uptake of iTero scanners is likely to have sustained, benefiting the company’s top-line growth.The continued rise in intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions signals an enhanced digital adoption within dental offices. In Q2, the total worldwide intraoral digital scans submitted to start an Invisalign case increased to 88.4% on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, advancing business performance.The company’s third-quarter results are likely to benefit from exocad CAD/CAM products and services revenues. These offerings, including restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design products, extend the Align Digital Platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows.Our model projects a 2.7% year-over-year decline in total Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services revenues in the third quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $181 million, indicating a 1.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $973.4 million, suggesting a decline of 4.2% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter 2022 EPS of $2.20 suggests a 23.3% fall from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.02%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Microsoft as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be October 25, 2022. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.30, up 1.32% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $49.62 billion, up 9.5% from the year-ago period.MSFT's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $10.03 per share and revenue of $218.57 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.9% and +10.24%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).In terms of valuation, Microsoft is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 23.69. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 22.64, which means Microsoft is trading at a premium to the group.Also, we should mention that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.02.

This ""presents a great return opportunity without any multiple expansion,"" he said.ValueAct, which traditionally owns roughly a dozen companies and distinguishes itself from other activists by preferring to stay behind the scenes, rarely presents its investment ideas publicly. Morfit said he was speaking out about Insight because it is broadly overlooked by the market.It is not widely covered by Wall Street analysts and has been lumped with companies like DXC Technology rather than Accenture Plc which is a more appropriate peer, he said.As Insight helps transform its partner companies, it is also transforming itself having hired a new chief executive earlier this year and having changed the bulk of senior management.For ValueAct, betting on the megatrend of digital transformation started when Morfit had a board seat at Microsoft years ago.While conventional wisdom might have suggested that companies like Insight could wither in the shadow of giants like Microsoft, this has not been the case as even Microsoft has sought partners with this specialized expertise, he said. There is a ""huge opportunity for the vendors to have partners that can make their services come alive."" (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

The gains help lift the S&amp;P industrials index 1.79%, the strongest performance of the 11 major sectors.""This is why the rally happened yesterday and the rally is going on today is none of the six-month views that we get from the earnings reporting businesses is overly dour, and that kind of goes against every last person that is saying we are going to have a recession in six months,"" said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.""Companies are actually really very good, catastrophes and crises aside, at being able to forecast within their pipeline now.""Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth for S&amp;P 500 companies of just 2.8% from a year ago, much lower than an 11.1% increase expected at the start of July, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 215.81 points, or 0.71%, to 30,401.63, the S&amp;P 500 gained 21.19 points, or 0.58%, to 3,699.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.23 points, or 0.18%, to 10,695.03.Also providing a boost was a 4.28% climb in Salesforce Inc after a media report that activist investor Starboard Value LP has picked up stake in the enterprise software firm.Signs the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike path may be starting to crimp the labor market were beginning to appear. Microsoft Corp, edged down 0.32% after a report it was laying off under 1,000 employees this week, becoming the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.The Fed's path has left many investors worried it could tilt the economy into a recession by making a policy mistake and raising rates too much. Fed officials have largely been in sync in comments about the need for the central bank to tamp down inflation.A report said ratings agency Fitch has slashed U.S. growth forecasts for this year and next and was set to warn that the Fed's interest rate hikes and inflation will drive the economy into a 1990-style recession.But economic data on Tuesday indicated the manufacturing sector remains on reasonable footing despite the Fed's efforts, although they appear to be sharply weighing on the housing market.Netflix lost 1.90% ahead of its earnings report after markets close, with all eyes on the video-streaming company's subscriber growth, which is seen falling in the third quarter.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 61 new highs and 81 new lows.

He said the state had not offered any evidence that Walgreens dispensed any prescriptions without ""legitimate medical purpose.""Reuters watched the proceeding via Courtroom View Network.When the non-jury trial began six weeks ago, it also included claims against Walmart Inc and Kroger Co, but those companies settled with the state last month. The terms of those settlements have not been disclosed, and the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.The U.S. opioid crisis has caused more than 500,000 overdose deaths over two decades, according to government data. More than 3,300 lawsuits have been filed, mostly by local governments, accusing drugmakers, distributors and pharmacy chains of fueling the crisis.Major drugmakers and distributors have collectively agreed to pay tens of billions of dollars to settle opioid cases against them, but pharmacies have yet to strike a nationwide deal.Two cases against pharmacies have been tried to a verdict.One, brought by two Ohio counties, resulted in a jury verdict against Walgreens, Walmart and CVS Health Corp last year, and a judgment of more than $650 million last month.Story continuesThe other, brought by San Francisco against Walgreens, resulted in a judge holding the company liable in August. A second phase of that trial to decide on a money judgment is scheduled for next month.Walgreens and CVS also settled mid-trial with Florida for $683 million and $484 million, respectively.

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.United States President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that the US economy will avoid a recession despite rising interest rates and soaring inflation, a lethal economic combo, and even predicted that it will resume growth in the coming months. Economic experts do not share his point of view. A recent report by news platform Bloomberg reveals that a recession is effectively certain in the next 12 months. The prediction, based on a new Bloomberg Economics model, forecasts a higher recession probability across all timeframes. Per the model, the 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 has hit 100%, up from 65% in the previous update. Analysts Anna Wong and Eliza Winger are leading authors of the new report. The model made by the analysts uses a total of 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to predict the chance of a downturn at horizons of one month to two years. According to the model, the likelihood of a recession within 11 months has climbed to 73% from 30%, and the 10-month probability has risen to 25% from 0%, in the past few months. Investors can take advantage of the selloff at the stock market due to these economic conditions, which has led to a broad decrease in the share prices of solid businesses like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), to reap the rewards later. These firms also have resilient dividend yields and a dependable history of payouts that provide an extra layer of protection against volatile market conditions. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the Fortune 500 list and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy NowImage by Steve Buissinne from PixabayBest Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now12.

Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

(NASDAQ:WBA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

(NYSE:LOW) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)’s is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.COVID-19 was a transformational event for the US housing market, causing homeowners to invest significantly in their homes as they shifted nearly all their daily activities to the home environment, including work, school, and leisure. The increased use of the home during COVID, in turn, increased the need for repair, maintenance and remodel activity, which significantly benefited Lowe’s same-store sales. As consumers return to spending more time and money on out-of-the home activities the near-term demand for certain Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) categories has decreased. Moderation in DIY demand combined with increased mortgage rates and decreased housing affordability has caused many market participants to become concerned that the home improvement industry may give up a significant part of their COVID pandemic sales gains.While we expect that there will be some near-term volatility and continued moderation of DIY demand, growth remains strong for projects requiring professional installation (the “Pro” business) due to a substantial backlog of projects undertaken during COVID, which should support industry growth in the near-term. In addition, we believe the medium[1]term growth outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong as demand is likely to normalize at a materially higher level as compared to the pre-COVID era. For the decade prior to COVID, home improvement industry sales were notably depressed relative to their long-term averages as a percentage of overall consumer spend and GDP and have only now returned to their longer-term historical levels. Moreover, we believe COVID has permanently renewed consumers’ focus, appreciation, and utilization of their homes, which combined with higher home equity values, strong consumer balance sheets, low levels of home inventory for sale and an aging housing stock that requires an increasing level of maintenance, will likely result in a structurally higher level of ongoing home industry spending in the future. In the most recent quarter demand strengthened throughout the quarter as DIY consumers returned from summer vacations and focused on less seasonal home improvement projects…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Japanese Stocks to Invest in 202210 Best Long-Term Growth Stocks To Invest In Disclosure.

It was the highest nine-month rise since 2008 and was driven by higher prices aimed at offsetting rising costs.""We delivered strong organic growth as we continued to adjust prices responsibly to reflect inflation,"" the company's chief executive Mark Schneider said.Shares in Nestle were up 0.2% in mid-morning trade.Despite the strong sales, some analysts worried price rises could soon push consumers too far, potentially pricing some of its products out of their reach amid a cost of living crisis that is seeing sales volumes across the industry decline.Britain's consumer price index (CPI) increased by 10.1% in September versus last year, the Office of National Statistics said on Wednesday, reporting the biggest jump in food prices since 1980 and matching a 40-year high hit in July.

The price of several key commodity inputs for Chipotle have improve in recent months — including avocados and chicken thighs, and while chicken thighs were still inflationary throughout 3Q22, we are encouraged around the recent moderation and see this driving potential margin upside for 4Q. Overall, we see less risk that inflationary food costs will drive an earnings/margin miss for Chipotle in 3Q22/4Q22, and believe that the less inflationary environment does give the company more price cushion should they begin to see consumers becoming more price-conscious.""In terms of labor, Goldman noted that ""the hiring/staffing environment appears to be easing and wage inflation levels are decelerating... With that being said, we do believe that there may be upside risk to labor margins should in-restaurant traffic continue to rebound (traffic was +3.5-4% in 2Q, and in-restaurant orders grew at ~35% year over year in 1H22) and should digital levels remain firm (low ~40% range). Restaurant throughput was a key topic of discussion during Chipotle's 2Q22 earnings call as the company works to improving onboarding and training for the vast amount of new employees hired over the last year, and we expect to be given an update on efficiency/labor initiatives currently underway as we see this as another underlying driver of same-store sales momentum as Chipotle recovers towards historical.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

111,faa426aa-2832-339d-ad5f-93e8f213f2a9,SYY,2022-10-19,Sysco's (NYSE:SYY) Returns Have Hit A Wall,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/syscos-nyse-syy-returns-hit-101526556.html,1666174526,STORY,['SYY'],"[If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Although, when we looked at Sysco (NYSE:SYY), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sysco:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$22b - US$8.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).So, Sysco has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Consumer Retailing industry average of 8.9% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Sysco roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sysco compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Things have been pretty stable at Sysco, with its capital employed and returns on that capital staying somewhat the same for the last five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So unless we see a substantial change at Sysco in terms of ROCE and additional investments being made, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger. This probably explains why Sysco is paying out 43% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn a nutshell, Sysco has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Since the stock has gained an impressive 59% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Like most companies, Sysco does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now.The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the food stocks that hedge funds are investing billions of dollars into.Food stocks are among the safest havens for investors during economic downturns like the one we’re experiencing, as they are the most essential consumer staple there is. No matter how much people are struggling financially, they have to buy food to eat.That’s been borne out during the current inflationary period, as food sales volumes have been essentially flat despite food prices skyrocketing by more than 10% year-to-date. In the United States, inflation jumped by 9.1% year-over-year in June, with the food index rising by 1% month-over-month. That followed a 1.2% escalation in food prices during May.In Canada, food prices have experienced the fourth-highest level of inflation among product groupings tracked by Statistics Canada, rising by 9.8% year-over-year through August. That trailed only the transportation, energy, and nondurable goods categories in terms of yearly inflation.That sales volumes are flat even as prices have shot up during a challenging economic environment highlights not only the obvious necessity of food in our daily lives, but also some of the innovations and initiatives that are spurring global food sales. Among them is the shift to healthier and more natural meals, snacks and ingredients, which carry a premium price tag. The healthy snacks category has enjoyed close to 20% sales growth over the past two years.Another trend that is benefiting some of the packaged goods and snack food companies on this list is the consumer shift from eating full meals to so-called grazing instead, otherwise known as snacking or eating quick ready-made products. With consumers trying to rein in their grocery bills, preparing costlier full-scale meals and making trips to the restaurant are being bypassed in favor of quicker and cheaper alternatives.Story continuesA quick look at stock performance shows the divergent paths that restaurant stocks and food stocks are on, as the AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF has sank by 22% this year, while the Invesco Dynamic Food &amp; Beverage ETF (with the great PBJ ticker) is down by just 4.5%, greatly outperforming the broader market.With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best food stocks to invest in now according to a collection of some of the savviest investors on the planet.10 Best Food Stocks to Buy NowOur MethodologyThe following food stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this agribusiness giant is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for ADM is 19.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 32.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 26.4%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for ADM is 31.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 18.4%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 12.5% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of -3.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for ADM. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.8% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made ADM a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that ADM is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more Jim Cramer stocks, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.High growth names at the stock market have been battered in the past few months as rising rates and soaring inflation push investors away from risky bets. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, predicted this turn of events earlier this year. Cramer, who was also at Goldman Sachs during the early part of his career, has recently made the bold claim that finance stocks were replacing tech names as “market leaders” as the Fed was allowing these firms incredible leeway. Cramer said that he thought that the group had the potential to become a leader again, but the banks could never pull it off because the Fed kept rates so low that it was hard for them to make money. However, he underlined that this set of circumstances was changing as the Fed was allowing these companies to make a ton of money. He explained this by saying that banks were paying next to nothing for deposits and then reinvesting that money risk-free in short-term Treasury, whose rates were climbing. Cramer also remarked that unemployment would increase if the central bank takes the federal funds rate close to 5%, which could result in a high number of bad loans for banks. However, the journalist investor noted that banks would be able to offset any damage even though there will be more defaults and delinquencies, but the net interest margin expansion will more than make up for it. Some of the stocks that Cramer has been monitoring lately include Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). Our MethodologyThese were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Cramer made on these equities during his appearances on news platform CNBC. An extensive database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the popularity of each stock among hedge funds.Story continues11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy NowBest Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now11. Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32     Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) operates as a pizza company internationally. It is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. On October 12, Cramer placed the firm among a basket of companies whose shares could pop in the coming weeks and months. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.2 billion in Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), compared to 27 in the previous quarter worth $1.8 billion.Just like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, LRT Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally (…read more)10. Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32    Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) provides care products and services in the United States and Canada. It is one of the top Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. During the Lightning Round of his show on October 11, the former hedge fund manager outlined his bullish stance on the company. While answering a viewer question about the firm, Cramer said that it was “a good stock to own” in the present macro environment. On October 7, Truist analyst Tobey Sommer initiated coverage of Service Corporation  International (NYSE:SCI) stock with a Buy rating and a $72 price target, citing the company's stable demand stream, recent operational improvements, and excellent track record in the return of shareholder capital. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $576.5 million in Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI), compared to 29 in the previous quarter worth $357 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Steel City Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our short position in Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) began to bear fruit when the company reported 2Q’22 results and I think there continues to be room for the shares to fall further. At the company’s analyst day in May, management articulated long-term financial targets that included EPS growth of 8-12%, inclusive of 5-7% from organic activity and another 3-5% from inorganic activity (M&amp;A and greenfield expansion). There are lots of moving variables associated with the outlook, but ultimately, reaching the goal is predicated upon continued strong growth in pre-need cemetery sales (which have favorable revenue recognition conditions). My view is that the recent boom in pre-need activity was a function of 1) a consumer flush with cash and “wealth-effect” driven spending with markets at all-time highs and 2) elevated awareness driven by COVID mortality, and that sooner-or-later the attractiveness of pre-paying $10,000+ for a cemetery plot that you (hopefully) won’t need for many years would become less attractive. When the company reported 2Q results pre-need growth unexpectedly rolled over. As investors come to terms with the fact that SCI is unlikely to deliver on its long-term guidance, shares should continue to retreat.”9. Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34     Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) designs, manufactures, and sells power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products. It is one of the major Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. The former hedge fund manager recently said the firm was among a group of stocks that could pop in the weeks ahead as the bear market comes to an end. On August 8, JPMorgan analyst Mark maintained an Overweight rating on Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) stock and raised the price target to $421 from $415, noting the firm would benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Impax Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), with 846,161 shares worth more than $177 million. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“On a securities level, our top contributors (includes) Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). All these businesses performed well fundamentally. For Generac, the leading provider of residential standby generators, fundamentals remained strong, but there was little to highlight from the quarter.”8. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) markets tools and storage for industrial users. It is one of the premier Jim Cramer stocks to invest in.

(NYSE:SWK) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $130, noting that the firm has been at the center of the biggest challenge in the sector in the past five years and that execution on new programs is necessary to drive EPS growth. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), with 1 million shares worth more than $141 million. Here is what Saturna Capital has to say about Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) performed well through the first part of the year but struggled over the summer. China accounts for much of its production, and their zero-tolerance approach to pandemic safety measures has led to disruption, compounded by shipping difficulties and rising materials expenses. We still believe one outcome of the pandemic will be a buoyant home improvement market, given that one never knows when the next pandemic lockdown may occur.”7. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients. It is one of the elite Jim Cramer stocks to invest in.

Analyst Sam Margolin issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based firm Markel Gayner Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), with 1.5 million shares worth more than $113.6 million. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases.

117,30ab10e3-cf60-3953-840a-53b6fe3bfd69,ADM,2022-10-19,Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-adm-reports-140102844.html,1666101662,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis agribusiness giant is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +46.4%.Revenues are expected to be $22.91 billion, up 12.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.39% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for ADM?For ADM, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that ADM will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that ADM would post earnings of $1.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.15, delivering a surprise of +22.86%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.ADM appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). ADM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 13.48, while its industry has an average P/E of 14.71. Over the past year, ADM's Forward P/E has been as high as 116.19 and as low as 11.67, with a median of 14.20.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. ADM has a P/S ratio of 0.51. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.76.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that Archer Daniels Midland is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, ADM feels like a great value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The annual inflation rate is 8.3% for the 12 months ended August 2022,according to the U.S. Labor Department data published on Sep 13, 2022.To counter the swelling inflation, the Federal Reserve has implemented five interest rate hikes so far this year to achieve a 2% inflation rate target. The Fed expects interest rates to reach 4.4% by this year-end, up from the current range of 3-3.25%.Rising interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will affect consumer spending. It will also cause a higher unemployment rate, thus slowing down economic growth. Notably, the United States recorded two successive quarters of downturn.Defensive Stocks: A Safe Haven Amid Economic TurmoilGiven the current market situation and the growing fears of an upcoming recession, investors are panicking to continue investing in the market. Does it mean that there are no sectors to invest in amid this market volatility?To stay safe and avail returns in this unpredictable market condition, investors can pump their resources into the defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care.Story continuesThese sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services, which consumers will continue to access even during an unprecedented economic turmoil.Stocks catering to the defensive sectors are less likely to get affected by the economic turbulence and will thus remain a suitable choice for stable earnings.Defensive stocks also tend to offer high-dividend yields, and cater to capital preservation and income generation, thereby emerging as solid picks for investors to diversify their portfolio.Our Top Stock SuggestionsWe recommend four defensive stocks as these are less sensitive to take a hit from an economic downturn.

(NASDAQ:SNPS) Worth Looking At Closely?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-292-synopsys-inc-nasdaq-115154558.html,1666180314,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$390 and falling to the lows of US$276. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Synopsys' current trading price of US$292 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Synopsys’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Synopsys Is Synopsys Still Cheap?According to my valuation model, Synopsys seems to be fairly priced at around 9.4% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Synopsys today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $322.44, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Synopsys’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Synopsys look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 51% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Synopsys. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SNPS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on SNPS, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 3.7% loss over the past four weeks.The upswing came after the activist hedge fund Starboard Value founder Jeff Smith revealed buying stake in the enterprise software maker during an interview with CNBC’s David Faber. Smith didn’t disclose the dollar amount during the interview but stated that the stake is significant.This customer-management software developer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.21 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.7%. Revenues are expected to be $7.82 billion, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Salesforce.com, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.75 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for United: mixed.

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.United States President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that the US economy will avoid a recession despite rising interest rates and soaring inflation, a lethal economic combo, and even predicted that it will resume growth in the coming months. Economic experts do not share his point of view. A recent report by news platform Bloomberg reveals that a recession is effectively certain in the next 12 months. The prediction, based on a new Bloomberg Economics model, forecasts a higher recession probability across all timeframes. Per the model, the 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 has hit 100%, up from 65% in the previous update. Analysts Anna Wong and Eliza Winger are leading authors of the new report. The model made by the analysts uses a total of 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to predict the chance of a downturn at horizons of one month to two years. According to the model, the likelihood of a recession within 11 months has climbed to 73% from 30%, and the 10-month probability has risen to 25% from 0%, in the past few months. Investors can take advantage of the selloff at the stock market due to these economic conditions, which has led to a broad decrease in the share prices of solid businesses like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), to reap the rewards later. These firms also have resilient dividend yields and a dependable history of payouts that provide an extra layer of protection against volatile market conditions. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the Fortune 500 list and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy NowImage by Steve Buissinne from PixabayBest Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now12.

On August 8, the firm posted earnings for the second quarter of 2022, reporting earnings per share of $0.92, beating market estimates by $0.04. The revenue over the period rose 77% year-on-year to $6 billion, above analyst consensus estimates of $5.18 billion.On July 20, Barclays analyst Theresa Chen maintained an Equal Weight rating on ONEOK, Inc.

(NYSE:PM), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) is one of the best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q3 2021 investor letter, Miller Howard Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:”In late August, we increased the portfolio’s cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We added ONEOK Inc. (OKE) with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.”11. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40     Dividend Yield as of October 18: 5.43%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated technology solutions and services worldwide. It is one of the top large cap stocks to invest in. On October 6, IBM said that it would invest $20 billion across the Hudson Valley region over the next 10 years. IBM plans to expand the development and manufacturing of semiconductors, mainframe technology, and artificial intelligence through this investment. On October 6, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring maintained an Overweight rating on International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stock and lowered the price target to $152 from $155, noting that continued wage pressure in consulting and expectations for a sub-seasonal mainframe quarter were some of the headwinds for the shares. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 40 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $948 million in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), compared to 43 in the previous quarter worth $1.2 billion.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, St. James Investment Company, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“IBM was not the first company to build computers. The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

(NASDAQ:WBA) operates as a pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company. It is one of the premier large cap stocks to invest in.

On September 2, Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation announced that the redesigned COVID-19 booster shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna will now be available nationwide for eligible individuals aged 12 years and above.On October 13, investment advisory Mizuho maintained a Neutral rating on Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA), compared to 38 in the previous quarter worth $737 million.In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Aristotle Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9. Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41      Dividend Yield as of October 18: 6.34%Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) operates as an energy infrastructure company in North America.

(NYSE:LUMN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Lumen – Lumen reported weak organic revenue growth and guided more weakness for 2022. We expect revenue growth to kick back in towards the end of 2022, and the huge FCF coupon helped offset value decline from the weaker guidance. The other factor weighing on the stock price was largest shareholder Temasek’s partial sale of its 10% position in the quarter, creating uncertainty and a share price overhang. We have a 13D filed and continue to urge the company to take steps to address the significant price-to-value gap, including continued share buybacks.”7. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48     Dividend Yield as of October 18: 8.43%Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States.

(NYSE:MO) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Altria (MO) shook off the prospects of a ban on menthol and a potential cap on nicotine and gained 20%. We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are available here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the market’s multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x – 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.”6. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 53   Dividend Yield as of October 18: 2.16%Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) operates as a home improvement retailer in the United States and internationally. It is one of the best large cap stocks to invest in. On September 8, Lowe’s Companies, Inc.

Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) will be one of the first retailers on Instacart App to roll out same day delivery for large items up to 3x3x5 feet and 60 pounds.On October 3, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski maintained a Buy rating on Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) stock and raised the price target to $259 from $255, noting that the company's home improvement outlays had slowed due to under-appreciated downside cushion.Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pershing Square is a leading shareholder in Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), with 10 million shares worth more than $1.8 billion. Alongside Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is one of the best Fortune 500 dividend stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Here is what Pershing Square Holdings specifically said about Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)’s is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.COVID-19 was a transformational event for the US housing market, causing homeowners to invest significantly in their homes as they shifted nearly all their daily activities to the home environment, including work, school, and leisure. The increased use of the home during COVID, in turn, increased the need for repair, maintenance and remodel activity, which significantly benefited Lowe’s same-store sales. As consumers return to spending more time and money on out-of-the home activities the near-term demand for certain Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) categories has decreased. Moderation in DIY demand combined with increased mortgage rates and decreased housing affordability has caused many market participants to become concerned that the home improvement industry may give up a significant part of their COVID pandemic sales gains.While we expect that there will be some near-term volatility and continued moderation of DIY demand, growth remains strong for projects requiring professional installation (the “Pro” business) due to a substantial backlog of projects undertaken during COVID, which should support industry growth in the near-term. In addition, we believe the medium[1]term growth outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong as demand is likely to normalize at a materially higher level as compared to the pre-COVID era. For the decade prior to COVID, home improvement industry sales were notably depressed relative to their long-term averages as a percentage of overall consumer spend and GDP and have only now returned to their longer-term historical levels. Moreover, we believe COVID has permanently renewed consumers’ focus, appreciation, and utilization of their homes, which combined with higher home equity values, strong consumer balance sheets, low levels of home inventory for sale and an aging housing stock that requires an increasing level of maintenance, will likely result in a structurally higher level of ongoing home industry spending in the future. In the most recent quarter demand strengthened throughout the quarter as DIY consumers returned from summer vacations and focused on less seasonal home improvement projects…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Japanese Stocks to Invest in 202210 Best Long-Term Growth Stocks To Invest In Disclosure.

(NYSE:HCA)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-hca-healthcare-110036321.html,1666177236,STORY,['HCA'],"[Let's talk about the popular HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine HCA Healthcare’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare What Is HCA Healthcare Worth?Good news, investors! HCA Healthcare is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that HCA Healthcare’s ratio of 9.26x is below its peer average of 19.22x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because HCA Healthcare’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from HCA Healthcare?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a negative profit growth of -4.8% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for HCA Healthcare. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Although HCA is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, the negative profit outlook does bring on some uncertainty, which equates to higher risk. I recommend you think about whether you want to increase your portfolio exposure to HCA, or whether diversifying into another stock may be a better move for your total risk and return.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on HCA for a while, but hesitant on making the leap, I recommend you dig deeper into the stock. Given its current price multiple, now is a great time to make a decision. But keep in mind the risks that come with negative growth prospects in the future.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing HCA Healthcare at this point in time. While conducting our analysis, we found that HCA Healthcare has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.If you are no longer interested in HCA Healthcare, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

HCA is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 21, before the opening bell.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare’s third-quarter earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $3.89, indicating a decline of 14.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimates suggest an EPS of $4.07 in the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus mark for revenues stands at $15 billion, suggesting a 1.5% dip from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimates indicate total revenues of $15.2 billion for the third quarter.Earnings Surprise HistoryHCA Healthcare has a decent earnings surprise history. Its bottom line beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same twice, the average surprise being 4.95%. This is depicted in the chart below:HCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHCA Healthcare, Inc. price-eps-surprise | HCA Healthcare, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteIn the third quarter, HCA Healthcare’s revenues are expected to have gained on improved patient volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equivalent admissions hints at a 1% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimates for the metric, on a reported and same-facility basis, suggest 2% and 4.7% growth, respectively, from the prior-year quarter’s corresponding reported numbers.Better outpatient volumes resulting from increased same-facility emergency room visits and same-facility outpatient surgeries are likely to have provided an impetus to HCA’s third-quarter revenues. However, the moderation of growth in inpatient admissions might have acted as a partial offset to HCA’s top-line growth.The consensus mark for the total number of hospitals in the third quarter is pegged at 183, while our estimates suggest the metric at 184.The bottom line of HCA Healthcare is expected to have suffered due to continued labor costs arising from scarcity of labor, an issue that has been plaguing the entire United States for quite some time. Another potential constraint affecting the whole nation is the persistent inflationary impact on expenses that might have dampened a company's margins in the to-be-reported quarter and HCA is no exception to this trend.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for HCA Healthcare this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here as elaborated below.Earnings ESP: HCA Healthcare has an Earnings ESP of -1.39% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $3.84 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: HCA Healthcare currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for HCA Healthcare, here are some companies from the Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings beat this time around:Chimerix, Inc. CMRX has an Earnings ESP of +33.81% and a Zacks Rank of 2, currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMRX’s third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at $2.10 per share. A loss of 21 cents per share was reported in the prior-year quarter.The consensus mark for Chimerix’s third-quarter earnings has moved 1.4% north over the past 30 days.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. BMRN has an Earnings ESP of +10.77% and a Zacks Rank #2, currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BMRN's third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at 36 cents per share, which doubled from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s  earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC has an Earnings ESP of +0.61% and a Zacks Rank #3, currently. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABC’s third-quarter 2022 earnings is pegged at $2.58 per share, which indicates an 8% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.AmerisourceBergen’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

135,93eae5ee-c026-3fe0-abb4-2c7c200b947f,HCA,2022-10-19,Earnings Preview: Universal Health Services (UHS) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-universal-health-services-140102420.html,1666101662,STORY,"['UHS', 'HCA']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Universal Health Services (UHS) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis hospital and health facility operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.31 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.01% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Universal Health Services?For Universal Health Services, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.83%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Universal Health Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Universal Health Services would post earnings of $2.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.20, delivering a surprise of +5.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Universal Health Services doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Hospital industry, HCA Healthcare (HCA), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.89 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -14.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $15.05 billion, down 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for HCA has been revised 0.9% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.39%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that HCA will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PPG) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$137 and falling to the lows of US$110. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether PPG Industries' current trading price of US$113 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at PPG Industries’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries What Is PPG Industries Worth?Great news for investors – PPG Industries is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $184.94, but it is currently trading at US$113 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, PPG Industries’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from PPG Industries?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio.

PPG Industries' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 91%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since PPG is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PPG for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy PPG.

137,c41f2ba3-43f7-3f51-806c-e6b205d81bf1,GS,2022-10-19,"Goldman Sachs' consumer pivot solves one question, but makeover raises more",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-goldman-sachs-consumer-pivot-043539518.html,1666154139,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[By Lananh Nguyen and Saeed AzharNEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's strategy pivot has solved one problem for investors who didn't love its foray into consumer banking. Still, Wall Street is yet to be convinced if the broader reorganization will create long term benefits.In its biggest management reshuffle in years, the Wall Street giant merged its traditional mainstays -- trading and investment banking -- and joined its asset-management and wealth management arms. A new unit focusing on financial technology products, dubbed Platform Solutions, will make up its third operating segment.However, Goldman said it was pulling back some of its consumer ambitions and its money-losing digital banking unit Marcus was placed under the wealth business.""The reorganization itself is just about geography on the income statement,"" David Fanger, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, told Reuters. ""It remains to be seen whether or not this actually results in greater synergies, greater focus.""In a call discussing the bank's third-quarter earnings Tuesday, Goldman's Chief Executive Officer David Solomon took multiple questions about the new structure.Christian Bolu of Autonomous Research asked what the reorganisation meant ""practically for the businesses"", while Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo asked Solomon to explain how the new platform solutions unit fits into the firm's strategy. Brennan Hawken of UBS AG said: ""I just want to try and understand strategically what the new direction is.""Solomon's response: Goldman Sachs is focusing on its fundamental operations while maintaining its financial targets.""The changes will further the strength in our core businesses, accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efficiency,"" Solomon told analysts. ""We are making a purposeful shift,"" he said.Goldman shares closed 2.3% higher.Story continuesGraphic: Price-to-book value of big U.S. banks - https://graphics.reuters.com/GOLDMAN%20SACHS-VALUATION/znvneyyrgpl/7yqWh-price-to-book-value-of-big-u-s-banks%20(2).png""It makes sense"" to reorganize the units in a way that's similar to Goldman's competitors, Hawken later told Reuters, adding, ""I don't think anyone was upset about them pulling back"" from the consumer business.Still, Hawken said Goldman could be fielding questions from investors about whether the rest of the strategies are iron-clad ""or is there a risk there could be further adjustments.""Bolu at Autonomous also said while the consumer part of the strategy ""makes sense"" the advantages of the broader reorganization are yet to become clear.""Ultimately the investment banking business is a great business, it has always done well,"" he said. ""The markets business has improved markedly."" His question to Solomon was focused on what would change on a day to-day basis, Bolu said, and that's ""almost to be decided.""TRADITIONAL STRENGTHSThe company's new strategy shows a lean into its traditional strengths of trading and investment banking and shifting away from Marcus, a business that was always viewed skeptically by Wall Street, said Michael Farr of Farr Miller &amp; Washington LLC.""This is a clear effort to reduce attention to and deemphasize the push into consumer banking,"" said Farr, an investor whose company held about $45 million worth of Goldman Sachs shares, according to its most recent filings.Senior executives who sit atop the storied firm will run the merged units, including Marc Nachmann, who will lead the asset and wealth management arm. The combined investment banking and trading group will be led by Dan Dees, Jim Esposito and Ashok Varadhan.""It's the same people working together,"" Solomon told Reuters. ""People are on board for this,"" he said, adding the company has a ""deep bench"" of talent.Observers said that moving Marcus under wealth management was a strong signal that the Wall Street heavyweight was stepping back from Main Street. Goldman had aimed to woo mass market customers. It struggled to gain traction or introduce a checking account, and the business lost money.""Marcus was a very long shot,"" said Fanger at Moody's about the unit's potential as a mass-market digital bank. ""I don't see much significant change in the current strategy other than this one pivot.""The pullback reflects the challenges of competing against incumbent Main Street lenders, said Mark Narron, senior director at Fitch Ratings. ""While the consumer strategy has been successful in generating deposits for Goldman Sachs, its expansion has also been costly in terms of operating expenses and provisions. A pullback in consumer ambitions plays to Goldman's proven strengths.""Meanwhile, the new structure demonstrates Goldman's flexibility and ability to adapt to market conditions, said Guido Petrelli, founder and chief executive officer of Merlin Investor.""As shall happen with any company during rough times, there is the need for restructuring and identifying synergies within the organization with the ultimate goal to cut costs and limit losses,"" Petrelli said.(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen, Saeed Azhar in New York, additional reporting from Ira Iosebashvili, Davide Barbuscia and Megan Davies in New York and Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru; editing by Megan Davies and Richard Pullin)]"

The gains helped lift the S&amp;P industrials index as the best performing of the 11 major sectors.""The banks were good... we’ll see if some of the other ones, more of the consumer sensitive ones, can they pass through their cost increases, have they stopped passing them though, but yeah people are hoping for better,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.""We need to see more of the earnings data, we need to see more of the data that will knock down inflation and then you can maybe get your rally going, until then I think everybody would say treat all rallies as suspect.""Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth for S&amp;P 500 companies of just 2.8% from a year ago, much lower than an 11.1% increase expected at the start of July, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.98 points, or 1.12%, to 30,523.8, the S&amp;P 500 gained 42.03 points, or 1.14%, to 3,719.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 96.60 points, or 0.9%, to 10,772.40.Also providing a boost was a 4.31% rise in Salesforce Inc shares after a media report that activist investor Starboard Value LP has picked up stake in the enterprise software firm.Stocks briefly pared gains late in the session after a report that Apple was cutting production of its iPhone 14 Plus just weeks after starting shipments, before shares of the tech giant recovered and ended the session up 0.94%.Signs the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike path may be starting to crimp the labor market were beginning to appear. Microsoft Corp, was little changed after a report it was laying off under 1,000 employees this week, becoming the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.The Fed's path has left many investors worried it could tilt the economy into a recession by making a policy mistake and raising rates too much. Fed officials have largely been in sync in comments about the need for the central bank to tamp down inflation.A report said ratings agency Fitch has slashed U.S. growth forecasts for this year and next and was set to warn that the Fed's interest rate hikes and inflation will drive the economy into a 1990-style recession.But economic data on Tuesday indicated the manufacturing sector remains on reasonable footing despite the Fed's efforts, although they appear to be sharply weighing on the housing market.Netflix lost 1.73% ahead of its earnings report after the market close, with all eyes on the video-streaming company's subscriber growth, which is seen falling in the third quarter. But its shares surged 14.49% after the closing bell as it reversed subscriber declines.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.67 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 102 new lows.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, down 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.56% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Mattel?For Mattel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mattel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Mattel would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.18, delivering a surprise of +260%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Mattel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Schlumberger has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Schlumberger will help you uncover what's on the horizon.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Schlumberger's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 154%. EPS has also lifted 22% in aggregate from three years ago, mostly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 23% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.6% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Schlumberger is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Schlumberger's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Schlumberger that you need to be mindful of.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Schlumberger. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that sit on P/E's below 20x and have grown earnings strongly.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Netflix grew in all regions of the world and said in a shareholder letter on Tuesday that it expects to sign up another 4.5 million globally this period.While Netflix isn’t growing as quickly it was a couple years ago, the world’s most popular TV network is back on a positive trajectory. More customers are signing up than earlier in the year, the company said Tuesday. That’s good news for investors in Netflix and its peers who suffered steep stock-market losses earlier in the year.“Thank God we’re done with shrinking quarters,” co-founder and Chairman Reed Hastings said during a webcast interview with analyst Doug Anmuth.Shares of Netflix rose as much as 13% to $271.39 on Wednesday in New York trading -- the most since January 2021. The stock had fallen 60% this year through Tuesday’s close. Analysts at several Wall Street firms raised their price targets for Netflix, with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Deutsche Bank upgrading their ratings on the company. Other streaming companies, such as Roku Inc. and Walt Disney Co., also rose.Read More: Netflix Jumps 14% on Strong User Growth Forecast: Street WrapA strong slate of fresh programs attracted millions of new viewers in the third quarter. The period started with new episodes of Stranger Things, one of the most popular TV series in the world. Netflix also released the Korean smash hit Extraordinary Attorney Woo, the movies The Gray Man and Purple Hearts, and the true crime drama Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, its second-most-popular English-language original series.Story continuesRevenue for the quarter grew 5.9% to $7.93 billion, beating analysts’ projections. Profit of $3.10 a share also topped estimates, and the number of paying customers increased to 223.1 million.“If there’s a unifying narrative for Netflix in 3Q22, it’s that the worst appears behind it,” Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall wrote in a note to clients.Dollar DilemmaIt won’t be all rosy going forward. Netflix is still on pace for the slowest growth in years. The company lost 1.2 million customers during the first half of the year -- a decline that led investors and peers to reconsider their streaming investments. Its customer base has shrunk in the US this year.The soaring dollar is taking a bite out of revenue and earnings. While Netflix said it can adjust content spending and pricing accordingly, its forecast for fourth-quarter sales and profit fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company estimates sales of $7.78 billion this quarter, below the $7.98 billion forecast by analysts. Earnings are expected to come in at 36 cents a share, a fraction of the $1.20 estimated on Wall Street.“We’re still not growing a fast as we’d like,” Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said in the same interview.Revenue InitiativesNonetheless, Hastings and Ted Sarandos, the company’s co-chief executive officers, argue Netflix has plenty of room to grow. The service accounts for about 8% of TV viewing in the US and UK, two of its largest markets, and is adding market share every year, the company said in the letter. Netflix is also profitable, unlike the streaming services operated by most rivals.Management plans to increase sales by introducing an advertising-supported version of the streaming service in November and charging for password sharing next year. Customers willing to watch Netflix with five minutes of advertising per hour can pay $7 a month, less than half of the cost of the most-popular plan.A lower-priced tier could help Netflix reduce the number of people canceling service or appeal to new customers in markets where growth has slowed. As viewership of linear TV falls off a cliff, Netflix also argued it would capture billions of dollars in sales once earmarked for live TV channels.While investors have long judged Netflix based on the number of customers it adds every quarter, the company is trying to get them to consider more traditional financial metrics like revenue and operating income. As a result, Netflix said it will no longer provide subscriber forecasts.--With assistance from Jonathan Roeder.(Updates share trading)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Fantasy of Instant Delivery Is ImplodingThe Private Jet That Took 100 Russians Away From Putin’s WarFemale Bosses Face a New Bias: Employees Refusing to Work OvertimeEurope’s Most Valuable Tech Company Tries to Avoid the Chip WarUkrainians Return Home by the Millions Even as War Rages On©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

But it also reflects a serious risk the government faces to protect dwindling dollar reserves needed to pay back debt.Investment bank Morgan Stanley estimated in a September report that the central bank's liquid net forex reserves had dropped to negative $3.5 billion, something the government has looked to reverse with faster grains sales.The government and central bank argue that the controls are needed to protect foreign reserves and stabilize the economy. It wants to avoid a sharp devaluation, though the peso has slowly but surely lost some 50% against the dollar this year anyway.""It is clear that the central bank has a duty to preserve its reserves and that is why it is working hard to do so,"" said a central bank source who asked not to be named, adding parallel rates were simply caused by market ""supply and demand"".Story continuesThe bank declined to comment.'COLDPLAY' DOLLARArgentines have long mistrusted their own currency, often choosing to save in dollars to protect against inflation - heading towards 100% this year - and devaluation. Previous tough and sudden capital controls have also made savers wary.Swirling economic crises in recent years, including a debt default and a major deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has put more pressure on the currency and reserves.""All these different exchange rates shows a political desperation for dollars,"" said Eduardo Maehler, 37, a self-employed worker in Buenos Aires.The government has tightened access to the dollar and added levies, especially on overseas travel and luxuries. It created a temporary ""soy"" dollar in September to boost soy exports by giving producers more pesos for their dollar-based sales.Some have popped up more organically: a so-called ""Coldplay"" dollar for paying sports stars or music performers in the country. The British band is performing ten concerts later this month. A ""Netflix"" dollar, meanwhile, refers to a rate elevated by various taxes on overseas streaming services.This month, the government added a 25% levy on monthly spending over $300 on overseas trips, goods in foreign currencies and luxury goods, on top of an existing 45% rate and 30% tax. The timing of the move ahead of the soccer World Cup next month led to it being dubbed the ""Qatar"" rate.""Clearly this has made travel more expensive in local currency,"" said Federico Rossi, owner of a travel agency in the city, adding some people would give up their trips as a result.Aldo Abram, executive director of consultancy Fundación Libertad y Progreso, said measures to keep the peso ""artificially cheap"" were not sustainable and would feed inflation.""We know the cost of imposing these controls over time: it always ends in a very deep crisis,"" he said.Pedro Cristino, a grandfather in Buenos Aires, was stoical. He blamed persistently high debt levels going back decades for putting the current center-left government in a bind.""The government is looking for many ways to solve things, some are healthy some are wrong,"" he said. ""All I know is I wouldn't want to be trying to govern right now.""(Reporting by Lucila Sigal; Additional reporting by Jorge Otaola and Walter Bianchi; Editing by Nicolas Misculin, Adam Jourdan and Deepa Babington)]"

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is PBF Energy (PBF). PBF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 3.56. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 4.88. Over the past 52 weeks, PBF's Forward P/E has been as high as 48.60 and as low as -103.69, with a median of 7.05.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PBF's P/B ratio of 1.29. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.88. PBF's P/B has been as high as 2.09 and as low as 0.58, with a median of 0.97, over the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PBF has a P/S ratio of 0.13. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.32.Story continuesFinally, we should also recognize that PBF has a P/CF ratio of 2.65. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 4.62. PBF's P/CF has been as high as 7.13 and as low as 1.74, with a median of 3.86, all within the past year.Phillips 66 (PSX) may be another strong Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock to add to your shortlist. PSX is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Phillips 66 is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 7.59 at the moment, with a PEG ratio of 0.62. This compares to its industry's average P/E of 4.88 and average PEG ratio of 0.62.PSX's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 19.08 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 10.34, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 2.40 and as low as 0.48, with a median of 0.64, all within the past year.Additionally, Phillips 66 has a P/B ratio of 1.84 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.88. For PSX, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.40, as low as 1.45, with a median of 1.72 over the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in PBF Energy and Phillips 66's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PBF and PSX is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to investigate if the company's decent financials had a hand to play in the recent price move. Particularly, we will be paying attention to TJX Companies'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for TJX Companies is:62% = US$3.4b ÷ US$5.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.62 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.TJX Companies' Earnings Growth And 62% ROETo begin with, TJX Companies has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 30% which is quite remarkable. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that TJX Companies' net income shrunk at a rate of 2.6% over the past five years. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesHowever, when we compared TJX Companies' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 31% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for TJX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is TJX Companies Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 38% (or a retention ratio of 62%) which is pretty normal, TJX Companies' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, TJX Companies has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 37% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that TJX Companies' future ROE will be 68% which is again, similar to the current ROE.SummaryOverall, we feel that TJX Companies certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

The president is prepared to authorize significant additional sales in coming months if conditions require, the fact sheet noted.This represents a major step for the administration but not a new strategy. As GOBankingRates previously reported, the Biden administration first tapped the reserves in November 2021, then followed that in March 2022 by ordering the release of 1 million barrels of oil a day for six months. That was the largest release from the reserve in its nearly 50-year history.The reserve now contains roughly 400 million barrels of oil — its lowest level in four decades.Earlier this year the Energy Department said it was planning a new method of buybacks to permit a “competitive, fixed-price” bid process as an alternative to index pricing.Another potential move is putting temporary limits on exports of fuel so more gasoline and diesel will remain in the United States, but a decision on that is not expected before next month’s midterm elections.The administration’s decision to tap into more of the emergency reserve follows a recent announcement by OPEC and its oil-exporting allies to reduce oil production by 2 million barrels a day to boost prices.Take Our Poll: Do You Think You Will Be Able To Retire at Age 65?Explore: 4 Ways the Fluctuation of Gas Prices in 2022 Affects YouMeanwhile, the national average gasoline price hit $3.854 a gallon as of Oct. 19, according to AAA.

Without this increase, global CO2 emissions would have been more than 600 million tonnes higher this year.Despite droughts in several regions, global hydropower output is up year-on-year, contributing over one-fifth of the expected growth in renewable power.The European Union’s CO2 emissions are on course to decline this year despite higher coal emissions. The rise in European coal use is expected to be temporary, as a strong pipeline of new renewable projects is forecast to add around 50 gigawatts of capacity next year.In China, CO2 emissions are set to remain flat in 2022 due to weaker economic growth, the impact of drought on hydropower, and deployments of solar and wind.(Reporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Bernadette Baum)]"

That will encourage firms to invest in production right now, helping to improve U.S. energy security and bring down energy prices that have been driven up by Putin’s war in Ukraine.” —White House statementUS foreign policy slips on oilThe 23-nation oil cartel maintains that its decision is purely economical. Several national leaders that form the group have publicly backed this intent.However, the US is convinced there’s a political sheen to it. After all, Russia, whose February invasion of Ukraine wreaked havoc in worldwide oil supplies, stood to gain the most from the decision as it could enjoy higher prices at its already-low output.Story continuesBiden’s rebuke of big oilOil prices aren’t only affected by SPR releases. Market forces, recession fears, and reopening of refineries under maintenance all play a part in the cooling off, too.And in addition to releasing reserves and replenishing stock, there’s another way to bring prices down: taking from the deep pockets of oil giants. Biden has called on companies to pass on lower energy costs to consumers “right away”:The profit that energy refining companies are now capturing on every gallon of gasoline is about double what it typically is at this time of year, and the retailer margin over the refinery price is more than 40 percent above the typical level. These outsized industry profit margins–adding more than $0.60 to the average price of a gallon of gas–have kept pump prices higher than they should be. Keeping prices high even as input costs fall is unacceptable, and the President will call on companies to pass their savings through to consumers–now.The US’ alternative energy planIn 2020, fossil fuels accounted for 79% of total energy consumption in the US. But Biden still plans to move to the US to a 100% clean economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.However, the transition won’t be without hiccups. Alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind, and ethanol remain less popular because they’re more expensive and less efficient.

So while the Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) share price is down 20% in the last year, the total return to shareholders (which includes dividends) was -19%. And that total return actually beats the market decline of 25%. Longer term investors have fared much better, since the share price is up 8.4% in three years. Furthermore, it's down 12% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. But this could be related to the weak market, which is down 7.4% in the same period.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Masco There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Even though the Masco share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.It's fair to say that the share price does not seem to be reflecting the EPS growth. So it's well worth checking out some other metrics, too.Masco managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthMasco is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Masco will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Masco shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 19% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 25%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 5% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Masco is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...We will like Masco better if we see some big insider buys.

186,a1b1eddd-88e0-3583-9235-30062376289e,SYF,2022-10-19,Synchrony (SYF) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/synchrony-syf-expected-beat-earnings-140102074.html,1666101662,STORY,['SYF-PA'],"[The market expects Synchrony (SYF) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer credit company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.84 billion, up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.32% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Synchrony?For Synchrony, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +11.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Synchrony will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synchrony would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.60, delivering a surprise of +11.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Synchrony appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

187,47a1953d-6a76-3de2-9d1b-b04af16eddf5,SYF,2022-10-19,Can American Express' (AXP) Q3 Earnings Beat on Estimates?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-axp-q3-earnings-130601300.html,1666098361,STORY,"['AXP', 'SYF-PA']","[American Express Company AXP is set to continue its earnings beat streak in third-quarter 2022, the results of which are expected to be released on Oct 21, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the diversified financial services company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.57 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.4%, primarily due to continued business momentum and a solid revenue stream. American Express also benefited from better volumes and higher Card Member spending due to a significant rebound in Travel and Entertainment spending. AXP added 3.2 million proprietary cards in the quarter. However, the positives were partially offset by higher operating costs.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 for third-quarter earnings per share has witnessed three upward revisions and one downward movement in the past month. The estimate is indicative of a 4.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimates suggest earnings to be $2.31 per share in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $13.5 billion, suggesting a jump of 23.7% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect third-quarter revenues to witness a 23.1% year-over-year increase.American Express beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 17.7%. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for American Express this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently +4.11%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.48 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: American Express currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected EarningsAmEx is likely to have witnessed improved volumes in the to-be-reported quarter, a trend seen over the last few quarters. It might have expanded, owing to total network volumes and billed business volumes. A rise in the overall spending level is likely to have boosted Discount revenues, AXP’s largest revenue driver.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Discount revenues indicates 19.7% year-over-year growth. Our estimate suggests a 25.3% year-over-year increase in Discount revenues for the quarter under review.Travel and Entertainment (T&amp;E) is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world, overcoming the COVID-19 woes. T&amp;E spending is expected to have increased in the third quarter of 2022. Fees, commissions and other revenues might have improved on the back of an uptick in travel-related revenues. Card acquisitions in some of AXP’s largest travel co-brand portfolios are likely to have increased.Cards-in-force is expected to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total cards-in-force signals a 10.1% year-over-year jump. Our estimate projects total cards-in-force to rise 9.3% year over year.American Express’s net interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The consensus mark for AXP’s net interest income suggests an upside of 21% from the year-ago reported figure.We expect the figure to increase 14.1% from the year-ago period. Further, we expect Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income to have witnessed a 47% year-over-year surge.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have set the company up for an earnings beat and year-over-year increase in the third quarter. However, the rising expenses in global commercial services, marketing and business development might have partially offset the bottom line. Our estimate suggests a 28.3% year-over-year increase in total expenses in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader finance space that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Axos Financial, Inc. AX has an Earnings ESP of +4.06% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axos Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.13 per share, implying a 9.7% improvement from the year-ago figure. AX beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 10.1%.Premier Financial Corp. PFC has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% and a Zacks Rank of 2.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Premier Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 80 cents per share, implying a 5.3% improvement from the year-ago figure. The estimates remained stable over the past week.Synchrony Financial SYF has an Earnings ESP of +7.31% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Synchrony Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.45 per share.

If you want to read about some more S&amp;P 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States recently released new inflation numbers that have brought into question the aggressive rate hike policy of the Federal Reserve. Per the latest figures, the consumer price index showed that prices in the country during the month of September were 8.2% higher compared to prices over the same period last year. The rate represents yet another decline for the benchmark inflation index in the months following June. The inflation rate had peaked at over 9% in June, the highest in nearly four decades. Due to aggressive rate hikes by the central bank to tame inflation, investors have been pulling money from the stock market to invest in less riskier ventures, pushing the US towards a recession. Benchmark market indexes like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading in the red since the past few months. They have registered year-to-date declines of 22%, 31%, and 16%, respectively. The chaos is spreading to global markets in the meanwhile as well. However, this slowdown has created several buying opportunities at the market where prominent names like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are all trading at discounted prices due to the overall macro uncertainty. Investors can pick up the shares of these businesses at bargain rates and since the bear market is expected to wind down in the coming months, these stocks could be the first to rally as the economy recovers. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the S&amp;P 500 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10.

(NYSE: BRK-B) reported strong earnings during the quarter and benefited from continued share repurchases below intrinsic value. The company also announced significant deployments of excess cash during the quarter, including the acquisition of Alleghany and a large increase in its stake in Occidental Petroleum.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116   Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide.

More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128     Apple Inc.

Apple’s shares detracted from performance as management lowered its guidance for the second quarter due to headwinds from the war in Ukraine, adverse foreign currency shifts, and dampened consumer demand associated with the coronavirus in China.

It was 2016, a year before Bitcoin hit $20,000 and exploded into the mainstream. Ribeiro began investing in the biggest cryptocurrencies. After Bitcoin crashed in 2018, he started to move into altcoins.“I finally found my tribe,” he told Fortune.Ribeiro immersed himself in the technology, creating a crypto-focused Discord server and founding an NFT-based music company. He was not alone in Brazil. The country has one of the fastest-growing crypto communities in the world, ranking seventh on Chainalysis’s global crypto adoption index for 2022.People like Ribeiro who learned about crypto from social media may have been the early adopters, but the new entrants into the space are financial giants. In mid-August, Ribeiro saw an announcement from one of Latin America’s biggest companies—e-commerce giant MercadoLivre—that it was rolling out its own cryptocurrency, known as Mercado Coin.Ribeiro saw the move as a no-brainer. Despite being founded in Argentina, MercadoLivre’s biggest market is Brazil. “It’s an exceptional business, if it is put into practice in a safe way,” he said of Mercado Coin. The same month, Mastercard and Nasdaq announced their own crypto-related initiatives for the region.While critics often describe crypto as a solution in search of a problem, boosters point to Latin America as a fertile testing ground—a region teeming with volatile currencies, inbound remittances, and knots of payment restrictions. As financial incumbents move into the region, Latin America may yet provide the answer to whether cryptocurrency can achieve mainstream traction.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comMercadoLivre—or MercadoLibre, as it’s called outside Brazil—was founded by Argentine entrepreneurs in 1999 as a competitor to eBay. It evolved over the years into the most powerful tech company in Latin America as it borrowed from Amazon’s playbook and built massive fulfillment networks. During the pandemic, with e-commerce sales soaring, MercadoLibre reached the highest market cap of any company in the region.Story continuesMercadoLibre has continued its ascent by diversifying. Just as Amazon began prioritizing cloud services through AWS, MercadoLibre realized it could expand its core business through financial technology, building out its online payment tool, Mercado Pago. In the second quarter of 2022, Mercado Pago represented 45% of the company’s $2.6 billion in revenue, with experts predicting that it soon will outpace e-commerce.“MercadoLibre is definitely pushing more into financial services to maintain market share in the region, and further boost market penetration,” said Grace Broadbent, an Insider Intelligence research analyst who focuses on payments.Latin America still has a large unbanked and underbanked population, with most estimates hovering around 50%. MercadoLibre has leaned on its broad customer base to ease users into its financial offerings. It found success by adapting to customer needs, such as allowing cash onboarding through Mercado Pago.The results have been staggering. As data analytics firm Latinometrics described, if MercadoLibre’s users were a country, they would represent the third largest in Latin America.In December, MercadoLibre began experimenting with introducing crypto into its payment platform in Brazil, Latin America’s largest market. Using the blockchain infrastructure company Paxos, it began allowing users to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ether, and the stablecoin Pax dollar on Mercado Pago, with a minimum transaction size of one Brazilian real, or about 20 cents. Within two months, the service reached 1 million users.“It’s a good data point to see that there’s interest in the region,” Broadbent said.The recent launch of Mercado Coin came on the heels of the trading feature, further staking the company’s commitment to crypto. The cryptocurrency would be an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain in partnership with the Latin America–focused crypto company Ripio.Unlike the earlier crypto-trading feature, Mercado Coin would be integrated into the company’s broader e-commerce ecosystem. For now, Mercado Coin is only tradable through Mercado Pago for around 10 cents. Users can make purchases on MercadoLibre using the token, and earn it as cash back.“In coupling the e-commerce platform with a digital wallet and a digital currency, it gives MercadoLibre the growing characteristics of a super app,” Broadbent said. “The crypto element fits into financial inclusivity and trying to meet consumers where they’re at.”She added that crypto integration into MercadoLibre’s growing payment platform makes sense given global trends. Despite the Crypto Winter, Insider Intelligence forecasts worldwide crypto payment transaction value will hit $16.16 billion in 2023—up more than sevenfold over three years. According to Morning Consult, last year Latin America had the highest penetration of crypto owners globally at 30%.BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA - MARCH 17: A virtual currency advisement of Bitcoins at a subway station on March 17, 2022, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Due to a nearly $45 billion debt restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Argentine government will discourage and regulate cryptocurrency transactions to prevent money laundering. Globally Argentina ranks 14th in cryptocurrency adoption. (Photo by Ricardo Ceppi/Getty Images)João Felipe Marques Falcão, a 24-year-old crypto enthusiast living in a Brazilian city near the border with Paraguay, said he has been following the launch of Mercado Coin, as there is nothing like it in the market yet.“It’s nice that you can buy a product and receive an amount in cash back, and use that to buy more stuff, or even convert it into other currencies,” he said. “It’s like a new way to use money.” As a frequent MercadoLibre customer, he said he was eager to try it out.The feature launched in late August to MercadoLibre’s 80 million customers in Brazil. Although the company declined to provide engagement numbers, it said it soon hopes to expand the offering throughout Latin America.“It’s like a new way to use money.”João Felipe Marques FalcãoMercadoLibre may be Latin America’s most important homegrown tech company moving into crypto, but it’s hardly alone from a global context. The same month that the e-commerce behemoth introduced Mercado Coin in Brazil, Mastercard announced it was partnering with Binance—the world’s largest crypto exchange—to launch a prepaid card in Argentina that would allow Binance customers to make purchases and pay bills with crypto. A survey by Mastercard from July found that 51% of consumers in Latin America have made at least one transaction with cryptocurrencies.Because of its ongoing battle with extreme inflation, Argentina is often touted as the ideal proving ground for cryptocurrency. Many of the region’s key crypto companies, from metaverse Decentraland to payments platform Ripio, started in Argentina, although the challenge has long been onboarding everyday people. Even so, the country ranked 13th this year on Chainalysis’s global adoption index.“Argentina makes a great test case to come into the region because of the rate of adoption of consumers, but also because of geopolitical and macroeconomic situations we’re seeing in the market,” said Kiki del Valle, Mastercard’s executive vice president of market development for Latin America and the Caribbean. “A huge influx of global players and Latin American players are entering the LAC region.”$16.16 billionForecasted worldwide crypto payment transaction value in 2023Source: Insider IntelligenceAnother newcomer is the Nasdaq, which partnered with the Brazilian crypto exchange Digitra in late August to help facilitate liquidity on the platform. While this is a definitively more technical application than Mastercard or MercadoLibre, Digitra founder Rodrigo Batista said that it would help with the long-term goal of onboarding everyday people.“The main reason adoption is not widespread yet is user experience,” he told Fortune. He said people will start using crypto when they don’t even realize they’re using it, like how consumers don’t understand the underlying technology behind streaming services.From President Nayib Bukele adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in the remittance-dependent El Salvador to prepaid Binance cards in inflation-ravaged Argentina, Latin America represents a unique laboratory where the main use case for crypto is not speculation.Even as companies bandy around buzzwords like “financial inclusion” and “democratization,” it will be difficult to assess whether they have been successful in spurring engagement until they begin providing user data. Regardless, the entrance of major players like MercadoLibre and Mastercard demonstrates that a new era of finance for Latin America is beginning.“Competition is only good,” del Valle told Fortune. “It drives greater adoption and accelerated pace for everybody to understand and demystify some of the concerns they may have in the space.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: The economist who just won the Nobel Prize warns the Fed will cause ‘all kinds of trouble’Microsoft’s remote-work-friendly CEO puts his finger on the big problem with working from homeGen Z activists who dumped 2 cans of tomato soup on Van Gogh’s ‘Sunflowers’ plead not guilty in courtSouth Korea stands to lose billions from making K-pop superstars BTS do military service]"

And as people get back to traveling, we know they want reassurance that the highest cleanliness standards will be upheld.In 2021, cleanliness standards were the top consideration for travelers when making plans2The health and safety of guests is always a priority for Expedia Group. Throughout 2020 and 2021, our Vrbo brand partnered with the Vacation Rental Management Association (VRMA), Cristal International Standards, and other relevant U.S. organizations to establish a set of industry-leading cleanliness standards for vacation rentals.Based on current guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the heightened guidelines equip rental owners with the knowledge to implement enhanced cleaning protocols. Combining this with cleanliness checklists on property descriptions across Vrbo platforms means guests can enjoy their stay in the knowledge that their health is of paramount importance to their hosts.Similarly, we collaborated with the U.S. Travel Association, industry peers, and health experts to establish new health and safety guidance. Following the latest science-based recommendations, the guidelines are not only a response to COVID-19, but a preemptive resource for potential future health threats too.EMBEDDING INCLUSIVITYGuests should feel welcomed and included no matter how they identify. That is why we have actively lobbied in Washington, D.C., and championed for gender designations on passports that go beyond the binary female/male options. And it's clear these calls for greater inclusivity are being heard. Today, several states include additional gender designations and, in October 2021, the US Department of State issued its very first passport with an ""X"" - or non-binary - designation.65% of travelers are more willing to book with travel providers that identify their practices as inclusive.3INVITING EVERYONE TO 'TRAVEL AS YOU ARE'Our commitment to inclusive travel runs through each of our brands; a great example of this is the passion of Orbitz. A longstanding advocate for creating welcoming travel experiences for all, in April 2021, Orbitz launched the ""Travel as You Are"" campaign - a call to celebrate inclusion and an invitation for everyone to travel on their own terms. It also served to spotlight Orbitz's dedication to promoting LGBTQIA-welcoming hotels. As part of this campaign, Orbitz donated $110,000 to various LGBTQIA-related organizations.Story continuesA search capability on the Orbitz Pride hub allows travelers to identify lodging partners that have signed an Inclusivity Pledge against discrimination based on gender and sexual identity. More than 40,000 hotels opted into the search tool ""LGBTQIA travelers,"" a resource that is now also live on Expedia and Hotels.com. Travelers can also access the brand's pledge of inclusion via the hub and learn more about Orbitz's historical commitment to supporting LGBTQIA travel.REPRESENTATION MATTERSKey to unlocking equitable travel are inclusive marketing and advertising. As a globally present business, Expedia Group recognizes the opportunity - and the responsibility - we have to create campaigns where diverse travelers can see themselves represented.Many of our brands look to our Inclusivity &amp; Diversity team and Inclusion Business Groups to help inform and advance their marketing strategies. For example, Vrbo is consciously dedicated to producing adverts that portray diverse families, with greater representation for Black, Indigenous and other people of color.We believe true inclusivity can only be achieved with collective progress. It's why we created our Inclusion &amp; Diversity in Travel Advertising guide. Through it, our partners can explore best practices for diverse imagery and inclusive copy, with accessibility embedded throughout.View the full Expedia Group 2021 Global Impact Report. 2What Travelers Want in 20213Traveler Value Index 2021Expedia Group, Tuesday, October 18, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Expedia Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Expedia GroupWebsite: https://www.expediagroup.com/media/default.aspxEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Expedia GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720827/Expedia-Group-2021-Global-Impact-Report-Traveler-Health-and-Wellness]"

The gains helped lift the S&amp;P industrials index as the best performing of the 11 major sectors.""The banks were good... we’ll see if some of the other ones, more of the consumer sensitive ones, can they pass through their cost increases, have they stopped passing them though, but yeah people are hoping for better,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.""We need to see more of the earnings data, we need to see more of the data that will knock down inflation and then you can maybe get your rally going, until then I think everybody would say treat all rallies as suspect.""Analysts now expect quarterly earnings growth for S&amp;P 500 companies of just 2.8% from a year ago, much lower than an 11.1% increase expected at the start of July, according to Refinitiv data.Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 337.98 points, or 1.12%, to 30,523.8, the S&amp;P 500 gained 42.03 points, or 1.14%, to 3,719.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 96.60 points, or 0.9%, to 10,772.40.Also providing a boost was a 4.31% rise in Salesforce Inc shares after a media report that activist investor Starboard Value LP has picked up stake in the enterprise software firm.Stocks briefly pared gains late in the session after a report that Apple was cutting production of its iPhone 14 Plus just weeks after starting shipments, before shares of the tech giant recovered and ended the session up 0.94%.Signs the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hike path may be starting to crimp the labor market were beginning to appear. Microsoft Corp, was little changed after a report it was laying off under 1,000 employees this week, becoming the latest U.S. technology company to cut jobs or slow hiring amid a global economic slowdown.The Fed's path has left many investors worried it could tilt the economy into a recession by making a policy mistake and raising rates too much. Fed officials have largely been in sync in comments about the need for the central bank to tamp down inflation.A report said ratings agency Fitch has slashed U.S. growth forecasts for this year and next and was set to warn that the Fed's interest rate hikes and inflation will drive the economy into a 1990-style recession.But economic data on Tuesday indicated the manufacturing sector remains on reasonable footing despite the Fed's efforts, although they appear to be sharply weighing on the housing market.Netflix lost 1.73% ahead of its earnings report after the market close, with all eyes on the video-streaming company's subscriber growth, which is seen falling in the third quarter. But its shares surged 14.49% after the closing bell as it reversed subscriber declines.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.67 billion shares, compared with the 11.62 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.70-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 102 new lows.

And net income coming in at $1.78 billion, aerospace and their space businesses really leading the way there. Now in a statement, CEO James Stoechler said, Lockheed Martin delivered a solid quarter, highlighted by strength in free cash flow, orders, and operating margins that positions us well to achieve our full year commitments.Now, we're seeing this patience really paying off for investors, Lockheed also announcing a $14 billion share buyback authorization. And they expect to execute a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program in Q4. Now, that's interesting timing because it's before that new tax on buybacks kicks in in January. Now while Lockheed also has a $140 billion backlog of future orders, growth isn't expected to really accelerate until 2024, as some of their investments in hypersonic missiles and other futuristic innovations really need a bit more time to pay off, Seana.]"

206,700284db-d4fc-3ae8-8627-8341d68ececa,PHM,2022-10-19,PulteGroup (PHM) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-reports-next-week-140102155.html,1666101662,STORY,"['PHM', 'NVR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when PulteGroup (PHM) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +51.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.05 billion, up 16.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PulteGroup?For PulteGroup, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that PulteGroup will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PulteGroup would post earnings of $2.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.73, delivering a surprise of +5.81%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PulteGroup appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, NVR (NVR) is soon expected to post earnings of $130.91 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +51.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.49 billion, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for NVR has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 6.95%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NVR will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October. The aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic are still being felt all over the globe. The virus saw industrial output collapse and led to widespread layoffs and income loss. This in turn motivated central banks to reduce interest rates to stimulate economic activity and give out cash assistance to help families navigate the tough economic environment.However, all these actions were not without consequence and now, the result of excess capital flowing into the market has resulted in increasing the demand for the products and as a result spurring price growth or inflation. To counter inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve are raising interest rates to take this capital out of the industry, and this will lead to a recession as businesses find it hard to find capital and end up reducing output.Commenting on the risk of a recession, hedge fund owner Bill Ackman was optimistic and in an interview given in October 2022, he said:Look I don't think it's knowable whether or not we're going to have a recession. You know it used to be we had economic cycles with recessions, it's been an awfully long time, but if the Federal Reserve got behind in raising rates and now they're gonna have to be more aggressive. I mean you look at what's going on in housing, people got used to a 3% mortgage rate and now it's 6%+ and that's causing the housing market to slow down fairly rapidly. Housing's a very important part of our economy. So if rate rises have that effect more broadly, then I think it's likely that you're gonna have a recession. If the Fed raises rates pretty quickly, which was our kind of recommendation more than a year ago, and you can sort of cut off inflation and get it trending in the right direction, then there don't have to be as severe and don't have to, if you will force us into a severe recession. But I think sometime in 2023 it's absolutely within the realm of possibility that we're gonna have a recession for sure.Story continuesEconomists polled by Bloomberg Magazine are more pessimistic than Mr. Ackman, with the latest report outlining that by October 2023, there is a 100% chance of a recession.

If you want to read about some more S&amp;P 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States recently released new inflation numbers that have brought into question the aggressive rate hike policy of the Federal Reserve. Per the latest figures, the consumer price index showed that prices in the country during the month of September were 8.2% higher compared to prices over the same period last year. The rate represents yet another decline for the benchmark inflation index in the months following June. The inflation rate had peaked at over 9% in June, the highest in nearly four decades. Due to aggressive rate hikes by the central bank to tame inflation, investors have been pulling money from the stock market to invest in less riskier ventures, pushing the US towards a recession. Benchmark market indexes like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading in the red since the past few months. They have registered year-to-date declines of 22%, 31%, and 16%, respectively. The chaos is spreading to global markets in the meanwhile as well. However, this slowdown has created several buying opportunities at the market where prominent names like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are all trading at discounted prices due to the overall macro uncertainty. Investors can pick up the shares of these businesses at bargain rates and since the bear market is expected to wind down in the coming months, these stocks could be the first to rally as the economy recovers. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the S&amp;P 500 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10.

More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles.

217,2db63aba-108d-3295-8023-b249bb5366ee,CCI,2022-10-19,Crown Castle (CCI) to Post Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crown-castle-cci-post-q3-131301629.html,1666098781,STORY,"['CCI', 'HIW']","[Crown Castle Inc. CCI is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 19 after the closing bell. Its quarterly results are likely to reflect year-over-year growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.In the last reported quarter, this Houston, TX-based real estate investment trust’s (REIT) adjusted FFO per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The growth in site-rental revenues due to elevated tower space demand aided the top line.Over the preceding four quarters, CCI’s FFO per share surpassed estimates on each occasion, the average being 2.72%. This is depicted in the graph below:Crown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCrown Castle Inc. price-eps-surprise | Crown Castle Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe advancement in mobile technology, such as the 5G network, and the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications have driven the growth in mobile data usage globally. Also, rampant usage of network-intensive applications for video conferencing and cloud services, and remote-working scenarios have fueled the rise.This has resulted in wireless service providers and carriers expanding their networks and deploying additional equipment for existing networks to boost their network coverage and capacity to meet the rising consumer demand. This upbeat trend is likely to have driven the demand for Crown Castle’s unmatched portfolio of towers and investments in fiber and small cell business during third-quarter 2022.Crown Castle has a strong and creditworthy tenant base that adds resiliency to its business and assures stable revenues for the company. Its long-term lease agreements (typically five to 15 years) with the top United States carriers are anticipated to have aided CCI’s site rental revenues for the third quarter.Further, in all likelihood, the company’s solid balance-sheet strength is expected to have supported its expansion efforts to establish small cells required to increase the capacity and density of the wireless network for 5G deployment during the to-be-reported quarter.The consensus estimate for net revenues from site rentals is pegged at $1.57 billion for the third quarter, indicating 7.9% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for net revenues from the network services and other segment stands at $172 million for the third quarter, implying a rise of 2.9% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.74 billion, indicating an increase of 7.3% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has been unchanged at $1.83 over the past month. However, it suggests a 3.4% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an FFO beat for Crown Castle this time.

Speaking from experience, it only takes a moment for a dog to slip out – and knowing within seconds that they've done so can make all the difference in ensuring a safe return home,"" said Christine Royal, DVM, associate vice president of Companion Animal and Equine, Merck Animal Health. ""Speed and accuracy were critical product features as we developed Animo GPS, so owners can be alerted quickly when and if their dog escapes.""In addition to its location tracking capabilities, Animo GPS utilizes smart technology to track a dog's unique activity levels and behavior within a user-friendly mobile app. The device captures data on sleep quality, barking, scratching, and shaking. It uses an adaptive algorithm to interpret this information and can send an alert through the app if there are any significant changes in these behaviors. This data is important because tracking behaviors and trends over time may indicate potential health concerns and could provide topics for pet owners to discuss with a veterinary professional.Animo GPS has a best-in-class battery life of up to 12-weeks, subject to usage, lessening the chances it will lose power in the time it takes to locate a dog should it leave its designated ""Safe Zone."" Animo GPS is designed to withstand the elements a dog may encounter, as it is fully water-resistant and responsive in all weather conditions yet remains lightweight and securely fastens onto a dog's collar.

Click to skip to the very top stocks in this category and see the 5 Robotics Stocks That Will Own the Future.Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA), Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), and Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) are a few of the robotic stocks that are poised to own the future as a wave of automation sweeps across most industries.As labor shortages and increased labor costs continue to challenge companies’ bottom lines, they’re increasingly looking for ways to reduce costs, not to mention costly downtime. Worldwide spending on automation was expected to double between 2020 and 2025, and that’s likely just the tip of the iceberg. Various reports have the industry pegged to grow at close to a 10% CAGR through 2029, topping $400 billion in value by that time.Automation not only reduces costs, but also improves productivity and quality control. McKinsey predicts that automation could boost global productivity by 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points annually, and that automation could effectively replace nearly half of the world’s salaried positions, which pay out $16 trillion in wages annually.The automation sector serves a wide range of industries, a figure which is expected to grow as technologies improve and enhanced sensors and processes become capable of automating tasks that would’ve previously proved challenging.The automotive industry accounts for about 29% of discrete automation demand, with heavy manufacturing and electronics accounting for similar market share. On the process automation side of the coin, the metals and mining industry has major demand for automation solutions, while the healthcare, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and chemicals sectors are becoming increasingly reliant on automation as well.Despite its long-term growth potential, robotics stocks have not fared well in 2022, underperforming even the otherwise lousy broader market. After gaining more than 40% from the end of 2019 through the end of 2021, the Global X Robo Global Robotics &amp; Automation ETF has lost 35% of its value this year, falling back near 2018 levels.Story continuesGiven the economic downturn and the significant upfront costs involved in launching automated solutions, investors are fearful that cash-strapped companies will hold off on making investments in automation. This creates the perfect opportunity for forward-looking investors to buy into a promising industry at rock-bottom prices.In this article, we’ll analyze ten robotics stocks that could make for compelling investments given their standing among some of the leading hedge funds in the world.10 Robotics Stocks That Will Own the FutureUnsplashOur MethodologyThe following robotics stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Robotics Stocks That Will Own the Future10. ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA), Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), and Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) are a few of the stocks that the smart money is betting on to lead the robotics revolution. The smart money also likes ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB), which provides automation and electrification-based tools, which figures to be an area of long-term growth.ABB’s Q2 revenue slumped by 2% to $7.25 billion, but that was due to an 8 percentage point hit the company took from the stronger U.S. dollar, as it does business all over the world. Orders were up 20% when discounting the F/X effects, to $8.81 billion, including growing by 33% in the Americas. ABB pays out a quarterly dividend, with its shares currently yielding 2.18%.Hedge fund ownership of ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB) has more than doubled since the end of 2020 and has held firm over the past two quarters even as the stock had started to run up against resistance. D E Shaw initiated a position of 1.88 million shares during Q2, while Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns just over 20 million shares of the firm.Artisan Partners chalked up ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB)’s recent share price slide as being due to broader negative sentiment surrounding industrial companies, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB) is a Swiss-based industrial conglomerate that manufactures electronic products and equipment. There is no new significant fundamental news on the company. We believe the share price decline relates to negative sentiment associated with industrial companies.”9. Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 18 Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) supplies analytics software and automation capabilities to the healthcare space. The company’s inventory management and automation systems can be used by health facilities to store, package, order, and issue medication, while its medication dispensing systems can be used by pharmacies and nurses to automate their workflow processes and reduce human error and waste.Omnicell is predicting $1.4 billion in revenue this year at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would represent a 17% increase year-over-year. Given the company’s $1.25 billion backlog at the end of 2021, that guidance may even be slightly conservative. Given its strong customer retention rate (99%), Omnicell is poised to eventually transition from a product cycle company into one that thrives on higher-margin recurring services revenue.Hedge fund ownership of Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) hit an all-time high at the end of Q1 before slumping by 31% in Q2. Anita Falicia and James Hillary’s Resolute Capital Asset Partners built a new stake in OMCL during Q1, but then unloaded it during Q2.The Carillon Scout Small Cap Fund likes Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL)’s suite of healthcare-based automation tools, as revealed in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Omnicell (NASDAQ:OMCL) provides an integrated suite of clinical infrastructure and workflow automation solutions for healthcare facilities. Cloud services have been a focus of the company and have shown good growth, automating many manual processes.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Industrial conglomerate Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) develops a wide range of products across various industries, building everything from golf carts, snowmobiles, and baggage tractors, to aerospace technologies and services, and advanced robotic land vehicles. Among the latter list is the firefighting robot Thermite and the M5 RIPSAW combat vehicle.Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s revenue was flat year-over-year in Q2, with the company pulling in $3.2 billion in sales. EPS was up 23% year-over-year to $1.00. Aviation, Industrial, and Finance were the company’s best performing segments during the quarter, growing revenue by between 9.7% and 16.7%. Supply chain issues are expected to impact the company’s ability to make delivers this year, pushing some projected sales into 2023.There was an all-time high in hedge fund ownership of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of 2021, but the number of money managers long the stock has fallen by 29% in 2022. Gregg Moskowitz’s Interval Partners and Anand Parekh’s Alyeska Investment Management were two of the funds that sold off their TXT stakes during Q2.7. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) supplies end-to-end automation platforms that allow customers to build complex automation processes through the UiPath Studio platform, and utilize machine learning models to further enhance their workflow productivity. The company also develops software robots that can work in tandem with custom-built automated processes to monitor tasks.UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) shares are down 69% this year despite the company posting solid Q2 results. It pulled in $242 million in sales during the quarter, nearly 10% about the company’s guidance, while its adjusted operating loss of $11.2 million was significantly better than the $55 million to $60 million loss the company was anticipating. The company’s annualized renewal run rate also surpassed $1 billion during the quarter for the first time.Hedge funds showed strong interest in UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) following its Q2 2021 IPO, but ownership of the stock tanked during the following quarter and has languished ever since. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has remained the company’s biggest bull since its IPO, owning 37.6 million PATH shares on June 30.6. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 28 Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) sells automation-based systems, software, and components across a range of industries, including energy, automotive, and food production. Supply chain issues impacted Rockwell’s ability to fulfill orders during its latest fiscal quarter, which has left the company with a record backlog. Yet despite the missed orders, the company still grew sales by double digits during its fiscal Q3. Rockwell also pays out a dividend, with shares currently yielding 1.93%.Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is yet another robotics stock that has fallen out of favor with top money managers in recent quarters, as there were 45% fewer funds long ROK on June 30 as there were two years earlier. Billionaire investing icons Israel Englander and Louis Bacon were some of the money managers who unloaded their stakes in the company during Q2.The Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund is bullish on Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) given the pace of reshoring initiatives in the U.S., which has companies exploring ways to recreate their overseas cost savings through automation. The fund discussed its thoughts on Rockwell’s growth opportunity in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is one such provider, which we purchased during the market correction this quarter. The company—still based in Milwaukee, where it developed its first product, a device to control the speed of electric motors, 120 years ago—has a particular focus on North America. Rockwell’s sales growth had stalled during the US capex recession following the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. The company sold sensors, actuators, valves, and control software, but lacked the ability to weave all these offerings together to provide a single control point for clients wanting to automate an existing plant or build a fully automated new one. Its 2018 minority investment in PTC Inc (NASDAQ:PTC), a Boston-based industrial software firm with a strong capability in augmented reality and visualization tools, marked a turning point in Rockwell’s fortunes. Through this partnership, Rockwell was able to develop software that integrated data from individual business segments, stitching it together on its “FactoryTalk” platform, to give managers a real-time digital picture of their operations. The company is now a chief enabler and beneficiary of reshoring initiatives as a wave of manufacturers scarred by pandemic supply chain disruptions look to automation to help them recreate some of the cost savings that had driven their offshoring in the first place. After hardly growing for seven years, the company saw orders increase 40% in the first quarter over the same period last year and predicted organic sales growth of between 14% and 17%.”Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA), Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), and Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) are some of the top robotics stocks that the smart money is buying.

Williams and Daroga are working to identify long-term, end-use customers for clean hydrogen as well as offtake options for environmental attributes generated by hydrogen production in Wyoming. Deliveries of hydrogen could begin as soon as 2025.Williams plans to leverage its nationwide assets for the blending, storage and transportation of clean hydrogen to local and regional markets, including the Pacific Northwest via the company’s 4,000-mile bi-directional Northwest Pipeline transmission system that passes through Wyoming. Williams is currently working with the University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources to evaluate hydrogen production as well as the impacts of hydrogen blending on existing energy infrastructure in Wyoming. The research, funded by a grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority, is expected to be complete in 2023.""This partnership with Daroga Power could lead to the commercial certainty required to enable the first major phase of hydrogen-based energy transportation and storage in Wyoming, building toward our long-term goal to scale up over time and create a clean energy hub in the southwest part of the state where we own significant acreage,"" said Chad Zamarin, Senior Vice President for Corporate Strategic Development at Williams. ""The potential to blend hydrogen into our existing natural gas stream is a significant advantage to accelerate the use of hydrogen in reducing carbon emissions across many sectors and applications, particularly those most difficult to decarbonize. Demand for clean energy is on the rise, and we expect the commercialization and cost-competitiveness of hydrogen to take hold as Inflation Reduction Act incentives seed market growth.""Story continues""Our partnership with Williams is a critical step towards advancing the hydrogen economy, both in Wyoming and beyond,"" said David Matt, Co-founder of Daroga Power. ""Hydrogen offers a flexible, clean and immediate solution to help achieve decarbonization goals that will benefit Daroga's and Williams customers. Daroga's unique development capabilities alongside Williams’ best-in-class infrastructure and operational experience is the ideal combination for providing consumers access to clean hydrogen.""Wyoming belongs to a four-state pact to become one of several regional clean energy hydrogen hubs designated through federal Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The Western Interstate Hydrogen Hub, known as WISHH, is an example of interstate and bipartisan cooperation to advance innovative solutions for the country’s energy future.Beyond Wyoming, Williams has joined several recently launched industry-led regional alliances including Appalachian Energy Future (AEF) and Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or Arch2. Williams is also engaged with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), a multi-state alliance including utilities, hydrogen technology manufacturers, universities, non-profit organizations, transportation companies and state agencies. Williams has identified two potential projects to deliver hydrogen in New York and New Jersey using the company’s existing infrastructure.About Daroga PowerLaunched in 2015, Daroga Power is a New York-based clean energy infrastructure firm focused on the development and disciplined management of strategically innovative and socially responsible energy projects throughout North America.

The labor battle across the world continues today. Roughly 150 Apple employees in Australia began to strike after negotiations over pay and working conditions stalled. The three stores involved in negotiations are demanding a minimum hourly wage of $31 Australian. That's in line with what US employees receive, if you account for currency translation. This comes as Apple stores all throughout the United States continue to express interest in unionizing.Another setback for Boeing 737 MAX Jets as the Federal Aviation Administration has requested the company review the safety paperwork for the jet. According to the Wall Street Journal, the FAA is unable to review the company's submissions due to missing and incomplete information. Boeing now runs the risk of not being certified by the December deadline as they continue to await regulatory approval for carrying passengers. Boeing has said safety remains the driving factor in its effort to meet all regulatory requirements in certifying the 737 Max 7.And US air taxi startup Joby has applied to Japan's Transport Ministry for aircraft certification, as it prepares to launch its urban transportation services. Joby is backed by Japanese automaker Toyota. It's already received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration, allowing it to begin commercial air taxi operations with conventional aircraft. Our Brian Sozzi yesterday asked LinkedIn co-founder and Joby investor Reid Hoffman to get his thoughts on that company.REID HOFFMAN: I'm looking forward to being able to ride in one.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$399k but in since the time of purchase.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$209 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$136 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 5.48k shares for US$1.1m. But insiders sold 990.00 shares worth US$220k. Overall, Boeing insiders were net buyers during the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeThere are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insider Ownership Of BoeingFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Boeing insiders own about US$56m worth of shares. That equates to 0.07% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Boeing Insiders?The fact that there have been no Boeing insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. But insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock, over the last year. Insiders own shares in Boeing and we see no evidence to suggest they are worried about the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

But the Applied Microbiology Services Laboratory (ASML) within its Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) stayed open.""The Buckeyes are amazing students,"" says Seth Faith, who serves as the executive director for the Center of Microbiome Science and strategic alliance officer for IDI, but also supervises the lab. ""A lot of them are hungry and passionate. At least one individual working in the lab had family in Wuhan, China, and they hadn't seen their family for two years. They wanted to be a part of solving this pandemic.""Over the next two years or so, AMSL employed 88 lab workers at various times, who administered more than 850,000 PCR diagnostic tests for COVID-19, with an average turnaround time of 8.75 hours.Meanwhile, an OSU professor named Karen Dannemiller had been going into homes and businesses looking for toxic chemicals in the built environment. She was also looking at microorganisms that could cause allergies or otherwise affect human health.In the fall of 2020, Dannemiller and her team went into the isolation rooms on campus, where students who had tested positive for COVID-19 were staying for seven to 10 days. They went in on a research protocol to see if they could find coronavirus in the built environment. Indeed, through PCR testing, Dannemiller and her team found that the highest loads of coronavirus were present in the vacuum bags collected from cleaning the carpet in those rooms.""We can literally go into any room, any building, any floor, and know the specificity."" - Seth Faith, Infectious Diseases InstituteCollecting dustFaith explains that with a respiratory virus, a person breathes out particles that will land in the space around them, not necessarily go into the HVAC system: ""The biological materials have a charge associated with them and they accumulate. That's what dust is. The virus gets entangled in this, and we can detect it with lab technology."" He reached out to Dannemiller and suggested making her experiment operational. ""We optimized her protocol. We made it more sensitive. We made it more efficient, more streamlined, and then found a way to help report data.""Story continuesEach week they conducted PCR tests to measure the relative rise and fall of virus levels from dust collected on different floors of strategically chosen buildings on campus. But Faith wanted to take testing a step further. He proposed they produce the sequence information for the virus to understand not just the level of viral load but what variants were present on campus. So his genomics team modified their existing COVIDSeq protocol on their NextSeq2000s for environmental samples and produced completely resolved full SARS-CoV-2 genomes from dust. And sure enough, when levels of the omicron variant rose in their student population, they found the same pattern emerging in the dust.""Take a building like a library that's fourteen stories tall,"" Faith explains. ""Where would you expect the virus to be prevalent? Most people guess the lobby. That's not what our data show. The lobby actually has one of the lower levels of viral load, and the highest levels are where people are spending a prolonged period of time, and probably unmasked."" They now have a lot of data taken during a time when the university required masks, and it shows that the students who got comfortable and even ate in the study areas were more likely to put the virus into the environment where the lab would detect it.OSU has greenlighted funding for weekly sample collecting from strategic sites and laboratory processing through summer 2023. ""This will help us tremendously, because all people-testing is voluntary at this point. We have this huge loss of data. We went from testing nearly 10,000 people a day to testing 10, so we don't know the distribution on campus. That health surveillance is filling this gap.""Faith is delighted that sequence information can be obtained through a targeted but noninvasive method. And since they're using what's in the waste stream, he draws a parallel with wastewater surveillance. ""Vacuum cleaner bags are just going in the trash can. And now we've found a way to take that trash and give people public health data from it.""Faith also plans to add influenza testing to their project scope. In 2021, Dannemiller won an NIH grant to build out coronavirus and influenza testing in Columbus elementary schools.Among their other projects, AMSL recently received a $700,000 grant to continue sequencing wastewater samples from 60-plus wastewater treatment plants and 10 Ohio universities and submit the data to the National Wastewater Surveillance System.Photo: OSU student Austin Shamblin with Noah Kayafas, full-time technician and OSU alum; both co-lead the dust project.Data for public health and the greater good""With every outbreak, we're going to need some sort of genomic technology to manage it,"" Faith says. ""The whole future of pathogen diagnostics is sequencing based-hands down."" He envisions a future when airports or restaurants use dust surveillance to ensure public health safety.Meantime, Faith is excited to prepare his students for the future, and the opportunities that AMSL affords. ""I'm not familiar with any students having experience using instruments worth half a million dollars or dealing with data sets that are a terabyte in size."" He plans to focus on helping students gain bioinformatics skills. ""Illumina has made sequencing accessible to everyone. The first step was on the lab side-anyone can make data off a NextSeq. But now we want students to be able to analyze and report large data sets.""Since OSU was established as an engineering and trade school, they've had 150 years to figure out how to train people in what was industry in Ohio. Ford and Honda both have a big presence, and our engineering college does a really great job at finding opportunities for those students to interact with and solve problems for the auto industry. But now biotech is exploding. I feel like biology is having its engineering moment.""That's one thing an engineer can't tell you: if there's a virus hovering in the Hoover, or the delta variant in the Dyson.Learn more about Illumina hereIllumina, Tuesday, October 18, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.illumina.com/company/about-us/corporate-social-responsibility.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720875/Tracking-COVID-19-With-Dust-at-the-Ohio-State-University]"

The project continues work initiated in 2015 by Southern Company Services and TerraPower under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC-15) award, a multiyear effort to promote the design, construction and operation of Generation-IV nuclear reactors. The project team also includes CORE POWER, EPRI, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Vanderbilt University. The program represents a $76 million total project investment with a 60%-40% public-private cost share.Story continues""The completion and installation of the Integrated Effects Test is an important step to advancing TerraPower's Molten Chloride Fast Reactor technology,"" said Jeff Latkowski, TerraPower's senior vice president of innovation programs. ""The MCFR will play a pivotal role in decarbonizing heavy industries, and we are proud to work with Southern Company, CORE POWER and other partners to develop the systems necessary to bring new reactors to market.""The next-generation of nuclear reactors promise the same stable value to customers that is derived from the current operating nuclear fleet, can complement intermittent renewable resources on the grid, and hold the potential to provide zero-carbon, high-grade process heat and thermal storage for energy-intensive industrial markets and ocean transportation sectors that currently rely on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy will be central to a sustainable, clean-energy future – providing affordable, reliable, resilient and dispatchable carbon-free power that is available 24 hours a day, making the success of this project integral to achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.The Integrated Effects Test signals important progress in the technology demonstration road map for TerraPower's MCFR. Data from operation of the test will help validate thermal hydraulic and safety analyses needed for the MCFR. The system will also support development and operation of the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment at Idaho National Laboratory, a less than 200-kilowatt reactor meant to provide experimental and operational data. Both the Integrated Effects Test and the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment will inform the design, licensing and operation of an approximately 180-megawatt MCFR demonstration planned for the early 2030s time frame.A Sept. 9 ribbon-cutting ceremony was attended by representatives from Southern Company, TerraPower, Idaho National Laboratory, the project and construction team, and technology partners. Construction of the Integrated Effects Test was completed by McAbee Construction Inc., and all electrical support was provided by Gulf Electric Company.In a recorded message during the event, Dr. Kathryn Huff, assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy said, ""The IET facility is a huge step forward in commercializing molten salt reactor technology that will help the U.S. transition to a new, clean-energy economy and help position the U.S. as a leader in the development of advanced reactor technologies.""TerraPower's MCFR is one of the most advanced Generation-IV nuclear technologies under development and is separate from TerraPower's Natrium™ reactor and integrated energy storage technology. The MCFR is a liquid salt-fueled, salt-cooled fast reactor that will enable operation at low pressures and high temperatures.

236,ac47bc1d-4101-3946-bf0a-aa2656d3174c,MAA,2022-10-19,Those who invested in Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA) five years ago are up 70%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-mid-america-apartment-111112577.html,1666177872,STORY,['MAA-PI'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (NYSE:MAA) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 12% in that time. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. In that time, it is up 45%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 55%. While the long term returns are impressive, we do have some sympathy for those who bought more recently, given the 24% drop, in the last year.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Mid-America Apartment Communities There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Mid-America Apartment Communities managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Mid-America Apartment Communities' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Mid-America Apartment Communities' TSR for the last 5 years was 70%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMid-America Apartment Communities shareholders are down 22% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -23%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 11% per year over half a decade. If the stock price has been impacted by changing sentiment, rather than deteriorating business conditions, it could spell opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

237,afcfbf55-a84b-345b-afc6-ea7922c90453,MAA,2022-10-19,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001897.html,1666098601,STORY,['MAA-PI'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.Years ago, investors at or close to retirement could put money into fixed-income assets and depend on appealing yields to generate consistent, solid pay streams to fund a comfortable retirement. 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s floated around 6.50%, but unfortunately, those days of being able to exclusively rely on Treasury yields to fund retirement income are over.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.In addition to the considerable drop in bond yields, today's retirees are nervous about their future Social Security benefits. Because of certain demographic factors, it's been estimated that the funds that pay the Social Security benefits will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.The First of Long Island (FLIC) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.21 per share, with a dividend yield of 4.67%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.34% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.8%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.26%. Check The First of Long Island (FLIC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Horizon Bancorp (HBNC) is paying out a dividend of $0.16 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.26% compared to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.34% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 23.08% over the past year. Check Horizon Bancorp (HBNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.25 per share, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) has a dividend yield of 3.35%. This is compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry's yield of 3.57% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 21.95%. Check Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now.Large cap stocks in the United States like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are already feeling the heat of an economic downturn as the earnings per share of these businesses register unusual blips in the face of rising interest rates and soaring inflation. However, analysts at top investment advisors in the US have backed these firms to emerge from the crisis better than peers based on the solidity of their business models. For example, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently named Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the most prominent Fortune 500 stocks, as a top pick at the stock market in the event of a macro slowdown. The bullish recommendation has raised eyebrows in the finance world since consumer and enterprise checks deteriorated in the third quarter, suggesting further downside to estimates, with valuation multiples lower but not at troughs. Per Woodring, the electronics giant had greater insulation in this scenario as opposed to competitors. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the Fortune 500 list were selected for this analysis. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.12 Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on UnsplashBest Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now12. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55  AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. It is one of the best large cap stocks to invest in. On September 26, AT&amp;T announced that it had won a task order to modernize networks for the US Customs and Border Protection. The agreement is valued up to $119 million. The firm will update the voice and data networks of Customs Border Protection under the deal.Story continuesOn September 29, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) stock and lowered the price target to $18 from $20. Analyst Kannan Venkateshwar issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 55 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.7 billion in AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 74 in the preceding quarter worth $4 billion. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) is one of the best large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Argosy Investors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“I purchased shares of AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) prior to its spin-off of Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD). Most people are probably familiar with AT&amp;T. They are a major cellular service provider, and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets, which include HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, DC Comics and the Batman content brands, and more. At the time of my purchase, I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield, or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD, which now has HBO Max, has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then, Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth, which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings.As a result, shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present, but we may add to it over time.”11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. It is one of the top large cap stocks to invest in. On October 5, the company revealed that its comparable sales in September grew 8.5% and net sales increased 10.1% year-on-year to $21.46 billion. Costco’s e-commerce sales grew 0.7% during the period, and excluding impact from gas prices and forex, they rose 2.3%.On September 23, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli maintained a Buy rating on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stock and lowered the price target to $559 from $571, appreciating the strong earnings of the firm. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Washington-based Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), with 4.3 million shares worth more than $2.1 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Portfolio gains were led by a diverse group of contributors. Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. It is one of the premier large cap stocks to invest in.

Here is what the fund said:“Improving health remains a key impact theme for the portfolio, and over the past year or so we have increased our exposure to the health care sector, through the addition of CVS Health, which is well-positioned to help define the future of health care in terms of costs, quality and convenience.”9. Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66      Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) provides insurance and related products and services in the United States. It is one of the major large cap stocks to invest in. On October 3, Cigna Corp said that it was expanding the Medicare Advantage plans for 2023.

Here is what the fund said:“Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) contributed to performance in the second quarter, outpacing the benchmark Health Care sector return. We believe Cigna benefited from investors seeking relative “safety” in the managed care sector and the stock’s attractive valuation at just over 10 times next year’s earnings. During the quarter, Cigna reported an earnings beat due to a better-than-expected medical loss ratio.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail, wholesale, and other units worldwide. It is one of the prominent large cap stocks to invest in. On October 6, Walmart said that it has reached an agreement to acquire Alert Innovation, an e-grocery fulfilment automation company. Alert Innovation has been working with Walmart since 2016, piloting the Alphabot System within Walmart warehouses using autonomous carts to help fulfill online grocery deliveries.On October 5, investment advisory Erste Group upgraded Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stock to Buy from Hold, noting that the company’s sales were stable and gradually increasing. Analyst Hans Engel issued the ratings update. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Florida-based investment firm GQG Partners is a leading shareholder in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), with 9.8 million shares worth more than $1.2 billion. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart and Costco has been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”7.

Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”6. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. It is one of the best large cap stocks to invest in.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the best large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly.

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shareholders have enjoyed a 62% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 33% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 23% , including dividends .Although Northrop Grumman has shed US$4.4b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Northrop Grumman managed to grow its earnings per share at 23% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 10% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Northrop Grumman has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Northrop Grumman will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Northrop Grumman's TSR for the last 5 years was 75%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Northrop Grumman shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

This compares to earnings of $6.66 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this aerospace and defense company would post earnings of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.99, delivering a surprise of 14.37%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Lockheed , which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, posted revenues of $16.58 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.43%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $16.03 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Lockheed shares have added about 11.8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -22.8%.What's Next for Lockheed?While Lockheed has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Lockheed: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $7.32 on $18.07 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $21.65 on $65.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Aerospace - Defense is currently in the bottom 46% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Northrop Grumman (NOC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 27.This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -7.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.Northrop Grumman's revenues are expected to be $9.14 billion, up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fund assets declined by -2.2% in the third quarter and are down -8.5% for the year.

Try to spare some time to check the fund's top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Leaven Partners mentioned NIKE, Inc.

That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as NIKE (NYSE:NKE), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance.

Click to skip ahead and see the 5 World-Class Shoe Stocks to Buy Now.Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) are some of the world-class shoe stocks that the smart money is pouring its money into heading towards 2023.Consumer discretionary companies and their stocks tend to get battered during recessionary periods, as cash-strapped consumers squirrel away their money to save for only the most essential of purchases. And shoes certainly wouldn’t make many people’s list of essential products (granted, we all need shoes, but not necessarily new shoes).Yet shoe sales have proven to be fairly resilient through this economic downturn. In fact, they had their best sales month in the U.S. in five years during December 2021, with sales hitting $4.48 billion. After falling to less than $2.7 billion per month in January and February, which are traditionally the two slowest months of the year in terms of shoe purchasing, sales have since rebounded to top $3.2 billion per month through July, down slightly from last year’s comps but also comfortably ahead of pre-pandemic sales levels.That said, footwear sales aren’t exactly a fast-growing industry regardless of economic conditions. The global market is projected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR between this year and 2030, growing from an estimated $388 billion this year to $544 billion in 2030.Athletic footwear, which accounts for well over half of all footwear sales, are expected to continue leading the charge when it comes to global growth thanks to the growing focus on health and fitness levels. Comfort is also becoming more important to consumers, while fashion-focused footwear has been on the downswing and losing market share in recent years.Despite their relatively solid performance in 2022, many shoe stocks have been absolutely crushed this year. Shoe stocks were recently dinged when Nike reported having record levels of inventory during the release of its fiscal Q1 earnings results. While that was due primarily to supply chain issues rather than a lack of consumer demand, the resulting glut is expected to lead to a surge in promotional activity that could pressure shoemakers’ margins in the coming quarters.Story continuesNike shares are now down by 47% year-to-date, while many other top brands like Adidas have been similarly crushed. Given the market’s seeming disconnect between the actual performance of shoe companies and their share prices, we thought now would be a great time to look into which shoe stocks might be trading at tempting discounts for investors.To compile that list, we gathered the latest shareholder data from a select group of the best money managers in the world to see which shoe stocks they believe are the strongest investments in the current economic environment.Photo by Christian Wiediger on UnsplashOur MethodologyThe following shoe stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 World-Class Shoe Stocks to Buy Now10. adidas AG (NYSE:ADDYY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 1 Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (NYSE:SKX), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ:CROX) are some of the most well-known shoe brands in the world. Another is adidas AG (NYSE:ADDYY), though its shares don’t have nearly the same institutional support as those other brands given that they trade over-the-counter. Just one of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database was long ADDYY on June 30, that being Frederick Disanto’s Ancora Advisors, which owned just 109 shares.adidas AG (NYSE:ADDYY) sells its Adidas and Reebok shoes and apparel through more than 2,000 of its own retail outlets, in addition to other sports and clothing stores around the world. Adidas shares have trended down all year, being down by 60% in 2022 due to discretionary spending on clothing and footwear expected to plummet over the short term. Adidas does about 37% of its business in Europe and the Middle East, with record low consumer confidence currently affecting the former region.Oakmark International Fund is nonetheless bullish on adidas AG (NYSE:ADDYY)’s shift to a more vertical-based business model, as outlined in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“adidas (NYSE:ADDYY) (Germany) is a global sportswear company. The business is a leader in athletic footwear and apparel with a brand quality that helps to drive superior sales and margins across multiple segments and geographies. In our view, adidas’ shift to a vertical-based model in the past several years led to superior innovations and more consistent product development. Moreover, we believe the improved product, brand perception, sales and profitability have positioned the company well. We think sustained investments in brand, product and distribution should support above-market growth rates and improved margins moving forward. We also appreciate that CEO Kasper Rorsted executed structural changes decided before his arrival, which should lead to improved growth, margins and capital management.”9. Rocky Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKY)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 7 Rocky Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKY) sells footwear and apparel through various brands, including Rocky, Durango, Georgia Boot, and the licensed brand Michelin. Its heavy duty footwear is primarily marketed towards outdoor enthusiasts, as well as law enforcement and postal workers.Like Adidas, RCKY shares have trended down all year and have lost over 50% in 2022. The company is actually coming off a solid Q2, as sales rose by 23%, though the company’s bottom line did take a hit due to various headwinds.Hedge fund ownership of Rocky Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKY) peaked along with the company’s share price in the middle of 2021. More than half the stock’s former shareholders have since sold out of it. RCKY shares have cratered by 60% over the past year.One of the fund’s that’s bullish on Rocky Brands is Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital, whose Small Cap Fund had this to say about Rocky Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKY) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:“Rocky Brands is a footwear manufacturer and distributor focused on the work, Western, outdoor and military boot markets. Management has improved operations in recent years, but temporary fulfillment issues associated with the integration of its transformational acquisition of Honeywell’s footwear brands allowed us to initiate a position at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic value. We believe Rocky is well positioned to navigate industry supply chain headwinds and exit the disruptions as a leader in the relatively stable boot category.”8. Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE:WWW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 14 Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE:WWW) distributes a wide range of footwear and apparel brands, including Harley-Davidson Footwear, Saucony, Hush Puppies, Wolverine, and Chaco. It sells its products in more than 170 countries and territories worldwide.Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE:WWW) grew revenue by 35% to $2.41 billion in 2021, while adjusted EPS more than doubled to $2.09. Saucony was one of the company’s strongest brands last year, growing revenue by 57%. In Q2 2022, Wolverine’s revenue grew by 13% year-over-year to $714 million, though margins took a hit due to some supply chain issues and foreign exchange headwinds.Hedge funds have also been bailing on Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (NYSE:WWW) in recent quarters, as ownership of the stock among the smart money has slid by 36% over the past three quarters. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital is a big fan of WWW, owning 3.46 million shares on June 30.7. Caleres Inc (NYSE:CAL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 18 Caleres Inc (NYSE:CAL) operates more than 1,000 retail stores through which it sells its own branded footwear, as well as other popular brands. The company’s own brands include Naturalizer, Dr. Scholl's, and LifeStride in its Healthy Living category, while its Contemporary Fashion brands include Sam Edelman, Franco Sarto, Via Spiga, and Diane von Furstenberg.Unlike many other stocks in this list, Caleres Inc (NYSE:CAL) shares have gained 5% this year thanks to strong financial results. Q2 revenue hit a record for the quarter of $738 million, topping consensus, while EPS of $1.38 also beat estimates. 72% of the company’s net sales were direct-to-consumer during the quarter, which helped drive gross profit higher. The company raised its FY22 revenue forecast following its Q2 results to 5% annual growth at the mid-range of its guidance, compared to a previous mid-range of 3.5%.Hedge funds largely maintained their investments in Caleres Inc (NYSE:CAL) between early-2018 and mid-2020, during which time the stock tanked from over $30 to just $7. CAL shares have since rebounded to over $24. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management built a new position in Caleres during Q2, which totaled 482,005 shares worth $12.6 million on June 30.6. Steven Madden, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SHOO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22 Closing out the first half of the list is Steven Madden, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SHOO), which designs and sells name brand and private label footwear, handbags, and other fashion accessories. The company has a variety of brands that target different gender-specific age groups, including the Madden brand for young men and the Steven brand for older women.Steven Madden widely beat revenue estimates in Q2 on the strength of $535 million in sales, nearly $50 million ahead of expectations. The company also reaffirmed its FY22 revenue guidance of between 13% and 16% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EPS for Q2 came in at $0.63, also topping estimates. The company has a strong balance sheet and should be more than capable of weathering near-term headwinds without much difficulty.Steven Madden, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SHOO) shares more than doubled between October 2020 and November 2021, and hedge fund ownership likewise doubled. Shares have since fallen by 46% however, and hedge funds are starting to look elsewhere for more promising investments, as smart money ownership of SHOO has dipped by 19% this year.Wedgewood Partners has been impressed by Steven Madden, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SHOO)’s recent results and decided to build up its position during the second quarter, as noted in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“Steven Madden, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SHOO) reaped the results of its competitively advantaged supply chain and generated a +55% increase in revenue while tripling earnings per share. Many retail vendors have been struggling to replenish their own stores let alone wholesale customers with inventory, but Steve Madden has done an excellent job fulfilling customer needs and is able to take ample pricing as a result. Many of the Company’s smaller competitors cannot meet demand as they were hobbled, if not completely wiped out, by COVID-19 induced shutdowns over the past few years. As economies continue to reopen, Steve Madden should continue to compound its market share gains at increasingly attractive returns, not unlike how the industry evolved in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. With the stock trading at a multi-decade low forward earnings multiple, we viewed the pullback in shares as an attractive opportunity and added to positions in the portfolios during the quarter.”Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

Notably, all the bank releases so far have one thing in common – support from higher interest rates and improving loan demand. This resulted in a solid increase in net interest income (NII) and an expansion in net interest margin (NIM). Also, banks guided for further improvement in NII for the year driven by favorable rates and lending scenario.Basically, growth in NII was the only reason the banks were able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings. Similarly, several other industry players might also be able to post an earnings beat this time.As finding such stocks from the vast universe of the banking industry can be daunting, we are using our proprietary methodology to find such picks easily. By using the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified three S&amp;P 500 banks -- Comerica Incorporated CMA, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated HBAN and Zions Bancorporation ZION -- that are poised to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter.These stocks have the ideal combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. And research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.Key Factors to Impact Q3 ResultsWe all know that the financial performance of bank stocks is considered one of the barometers of the nation’s overall health. As economic growth gained traction, the overall lending scenario improved during the third quarter. This, along with higher interest rates, is expected to have majorly supported banks’ NII growth.Now coming to fee income, on geopolitical and macroeconomic economic concerns, the operating backdrop became challenging for banks to drive up non-interest income. Thus, fee income, which had been a source of key support to banks’ revenues during the pandemic ear, is expected to have recorded dismal performance in the third quarter.On the cost front, increased investments in technology to boost digital offerings, business streamlining efforts, initiatives to expand into newer areas and inflationary pressure resulted in higher operating expenses.Now coming to credit costs, deteriorating macroeconomic outlook and higher loan balance led the banks to set aside a large amount as reserves. Thus, banks are expected to have witnessed higher provisions for loan losses in the third quarter.Story continues3 Potential Safe BetsComerica, which delivers financial services in three primary regional markets – Texas, California and Michigan – as well as Arizona and Florida, is a leading banking and financial services provider. A robust lending scenario and rising rates are expected to have supported the company’s NII. Management is anticipating NII (including PPP) to increase 21% sequentially.Further, Comerica’s focus on revenue-enhancing initiatives is likely to have resulted in an improvement in operating efficiency. CMA is scheduled to announce third-quarter numbers on Oct 19.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $2.57 indicates a jump of 35.3% from the year-ago reported figure. CMA has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseComerica Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseComerica Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteHuntington Bancshares, a multi-state diversified regional bank holding company, provides a range of banking services and products. As commercial loans constitute a major part of the company’s loan portfolio, it must have gained from improved demand for such loans during the third quarter.Further, boosted by higher short-term rates, improvement in the lending scenario and increased average earning assets, the company’s asset yields, NIM and NII are anticipated to have been bolstered. However, the industry-wide disappointing performance of fee income is also likely to have hurt Huntington Bancshares’ non-interest income, while the recently closed acquisitions (Capstone Partners and Torana) might have offered some support.HBAN is scheduled to announce results on Oct 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share implies a rise of 8.6% from the year-ago reported figure. HBAN has an Earnings ESP of +0.72% and a Zacks Rank #3.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteZions is a diversified financial service provider, operating a widespread network of more than 400 branches. The company’s footprint spans 11 western states, namely Utah, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon and Wyoming.Similar to Comerica, Zions has significant exposure to commercial loans. Thus, this along with higher rates, is expected to have aided the company’s NII and NIM in the third quarter. As the company plans to reduce overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees, management expects total customer-related fees to decline almost $5 million in the third quarter.On the cost front, expenses are likely to be increased due to inflationary pressure. Zions is slated to announce results on Oct 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.58, implying an increase of 9% year over year. ZION has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #3.Zions Bancorporation, N.A. Price and EPS SurpriseZions Bancorporation, N.A.

We've already heard from several of the major banks. Goldman Sachs the latest to report its quarterly results, coming out with a beat. But how did these big banks compare to one another in the latest quarter? Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Semenova here with me at the desk. We got all the big banks out of the way. In general, a pretty positive outlook-- I don't know if we should say positive outlook, but a beat. The expectations were fairly low.ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Yeah, absolutely, Akiko. I have to start out by saying it's really been a mixed bag for financials, as they've been reporting their results. On one hand, the banking industry is still doing just fine, compared to what analysts are expecting to see from some other sectors that are set to report in the coming weeks. It's really just the year over year comparisons that have been really tough after an incredibly lucrative 2021. And they're still meeting analyst expectations for the most part.But on the other hand, we are seeing bank profits taking a huge hit, driven primarily by two things-- lower dealmaking activity that is really putting a dent in investment banking revenues and them setting aside funds for potential loan losses, which is also weighing on their profits as they expect the possibility of an economic recession.But there are a few, of course, that have held up better than others. Goldman Sachs, yet again, was a standout today, beating on all fronts, coming in far better than Wall Street had expected. Profit was down 43%, but that was partially offset by an 11% jump in trading activity, led by fixed income trading specifically. So again, the expectations were low, and this was very much a better than feared situation with the big banks.Story continuesBank of America also posted a drop in profits year over year. However, it did see an earnings per share beat compared to what Wall Street was expecting. Also benefiting from better than expected trading revenues.AKIKO FUJITA: So those are kind of the winners, as you put it. The biggest loser?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, one more winner we have, JPMorgan actually saw a drop in quarterly net income. But Oppenheimer analysts said it was a blowout quarter, saying that blowout would be an understatement because analysts were really preparing for the worst when it came to this. But then you look at Citigroup. Citigroup profit fell 25%. Revenue, however, rose 6%. Again, it beat Wall Street estimates.Morgan Stanley was the only bank that really disappointed Wall Street, missing expectations and reporting profit that fell 29%. So that was one of the banks that saw a much more challenging quarter compared to its peers.AKIKO FUJITA: OK, Alexandra Semenova with the roundup for us. Thanks so much for that.]"
251,d9357cfc-fb38-3f42-bafc-eb7c0113fee3,PFE,2022-10-19,"Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) jumps 5.2% this week, though earnings growth is still tracking behind five-year shareholder returns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-nyse-pfe-jumps-5-110055769.html,1666177255,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 13% in the last quarter. On the bright side the share price is up over the last half decade. In that time, it is up 22%, which isn't bad, but is below the market return of 55%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Pfizer While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, Pfizer managed to grow its earnings per share at 31% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 4% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 8.39 also suggests market apprehension.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Pfizer has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Pfizer, it has a TSR of 54% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Pfizer shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 8.2% over one year. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 9% a year, is even better. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

252,3a603543-5b87-4afe-afb5-35e05bf51721,PFE,2022-10-19,Pfizer CEO: 2023 will be a 'pivotal year' as COVID-19 drug sales wane,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-ceo-2023-pivotal-year-as-covid-19-drug-sales-wane-195020896.html,1666122620,STORY,['PFE'],"[Americans are moving on from COVID-19. Most public places, transit, and municipalities have gotten rid of mask mandates. Vaccine booster rates have plateaued, even with the introduction of a new “bivalent” shot targeting multiple variants, including Omicron.Pfizer (PFE), the giant, legacy drugmaker, along with its partner BioNTech and rival, Moderna (MRNA), saved lives with messenger-RNA-based vaccines that also gave a big boost to profits. Now — to a degree — Pfizer has to move on, too.“Next year for Pfizer is a pivotal year,” Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit on Monday. “It is the year that we can prove to the world and prove to ourselves that we can do multiple launches. I believe in the strength of our commercial organization, and in the strength of our manufacturing organization.”The company plans to bring more than 10 new medicines to market in 2023, far higher than its typical one or two annually. That’s because it’s looking to replace declining revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and its viral treatment, Paxlovid. Pfizer has forecast those drugs will generate $32 billion and $22 billion of sales this year, respectively. That's more than half Pfizer's revenue.Some analysts don’t think the drugs will meet those targets. Carter Gould at Barclays, for example, is modeling $31 billion in vaccine sales and $21.5 billion for Paxlovid. He wrote in a recent note that sales could then fall by 43% and 51%, respectively, in 2023.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla speaks to Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman.Regardless of whether Pfizer meets coronavirus-related sales targets for 2022, the trend is downward thereafter. Bourla has laid out a plan to replace the revenue.“We committed to bringing in $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenue by 2030 and we are already exceeding 10. Our internal pipeline, I think, is the biggest competitive advantage, and business development will provide growth over loss of exclusivity,” he said.The prospect of revenue loss has haunted Pfizer before. Pre-2020, investors saw the biggest risk to Pfizer as being the so-called patent cliff, the loss of exclusive rights to some of its blockbuster medicines. Bourla, who joined Pfizer as CEO in 2019, was working to slim the company down and grow its pipeline of new drugs when the pandemic hit.Story continuesAs Bourla tells it, the process of developing and producing Comirnaty showed Pfizer employees that they could indeed be nimble, and that they could meet seemingly insurmountable goals. He’s trying to use those lessons to foster pharmaceutical development internally and through partnerships (like the successful one with BioNTech). He’s also been making acquisitions to gain new drugs, including Biohaven for $11.6 billion (migraine medicine); Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion (sickle cell disease treatment); and Arena Pharmaceuticals for $6.7 billion (immuno-inflammatory disease therapies).Bourla said he’ll continue on the same acquisition path: “We want to acquire science at early stages, that we can add value to by bringing our manufacturing capabilities, our clinical development capabilities.”Shares of Pfizer surged 60% in 2021 as revenue almost doubled. They’ve fallen about 25% this year as investors questioned what would come next. Sell-side analysts, for their part, are evenly split between buy and hold ratings.

If you want to read about some more S&amp;P 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.The Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States recently released new inflation numbers that have brought into question the aggressive rate hike policy of the Federal Reserve. Per the latest figures, the consumer price index showed that prices in the country during the month of September were 8.2% higher compared to prices over the same period last year. The rate represents yet another decline for the benchmark inflation index in the months following June. The inflation rate had peaked at over 9% in June, the highest in nearly four decades. Due to aggressive rate hikes by the central bank to tame inflation, investors have been pulling money from the stock market to invest in less riskier ventures, pushing the US towards a recession. Benchmark market indexes like the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are all trading in the red since the past few months. They have registered year-to-date declines of 22%, 31%, and 16%, respectively. The chaos is spreading to global markets in the meanwhile as well. However, this slowdown has created several buying opportunities at the market where prominent names like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are all trading at discounted prices due to the overall macro uncertainty. Investors can pick up the shares of these businesses at bargain rates and since the bear market is expected to wind down in the coming months, these stocks could be the first to rally as the economy recovers. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the S&amp;P 500 were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayBest S&amp;P 500 Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10.

On October 14, the company announced that it had received the regulatory approvals needed for the purchase of specialty insurance firm Alleghany in a deal worth more than $11.5 billion. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is a leading shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B), with 34.7 million shares worth more than $9.5 billion. Just like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) is one of the best S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q1 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Diversified holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) reported strong earnings during the quarter and benefited from continued share repurchases below intrinsic value. The company also announced significant deployments of excess cash during the quarter, including the acquisition of Alleghany and a large increase in its stake in Occidental Petroleum.”9. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116   Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide.

After the integration, businesses would be able to directly chat directly with their customers in the messaging app. On September 22, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman maintained an Outperform rating on Salesforce, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”8. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128     Apple Inc.

Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives extremely tight engagement with consumers and enterprises. The engagement is fostering the growing purchase of high-margin services like music, apps, and apple pay. Apple’s shares detracted from performance as management lowered its guidance for the second quarter due to headwinds from the war in Ukraine, adverse foreign currency shifts, and dampened consumer demand associated with the coronavirus in China. Additionally, many investors were concerned that lockdowns implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19 would impact production of apple products, however the manufacturing facilities have resumed activity.”7.

Only a healthcare provider can decide if PREVNAR 13® is right for your childPlease see full prescribing information for PREVNAR 13®PAXLOVID™ U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization StatementPAXLOVID has not been approved but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an EUA, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high-risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.The emergency use of PAXLOVID is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic under Section 564(b)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.AUTHORIZED USEThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the emergency use of the unapproved product PAXLOVID for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.LIMITATIONS OF AUTHORIZED USEPAXLOVID is not authorized for initiation of treatment in patients requiring hospitalization due to severe or critical COVID-19PAXLOVID is not authorized for use as pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19PAXLOVID is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive daysPAXLOVID may be prescribed for an individual patient by physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, and physician assistants that are licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs.PAXLOVID may also be prescribed for an individual patient by a state-licensed pharmacist under the following conditions:Sufficient information is available, such as through access to health records less than 12 months old or consultation with a health care provider in an established provider-patient relationship with the individual patient, to assess renal and hepatic function; andSufficient information is available, such as through access to health records, patient reporting of medical history, or consultation with a health care provider in an established provider‑patient relationship with the individual patient, to obtain a comprehensive list of medications (prescribed and non-prescribed) that the patient is taking to assess for potential drug interaction.The state-licensed pharmacist should refer an individual patient for clinical evaluation (e.g., telehealth, in-person visit) with a physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant licensed or authorized under state law to prescribe drugs, if any of the following apply:Sufficient information is not available to assess renal and hepatic function.Sufficient information is not available to assess for a potential drug interaction.Modification of other medications is needed due to a potential drug interaction.PAXLOVID is not an appropriate therapeutic option based on the authorized Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers or due to potential drug interactions for which recommended monitoring would not be feasible.PAXLOVID is not approved for any use, including for use for the treatment of COVID-19.PAXLOVID is authorized only for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of PAXLOVID under 564(b)(1) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDrugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions:Alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosinAntianginal: ranolazineAntiarrhythmic: amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidineAnti-gout: colchicineAntipsychotics: lurasidone, pimozideBenign prostatic hyperplasia agents: silodosinCardiovascular agents: eplerenone, ivabradineErgot derivatives: dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovineHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: lovastatin, simvastatinImmunosuppressants: voclosporinMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor: lomitapideMigraine medications: eletriptan, ubrogepantMineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: finerenoneOpioid antagonists: naloxegolPDE5 inhibitor: sildenafil (Revatio®) when used for pulmonary arterial hypertensionSedative/hypnotics: triazolam, oral midazolamSerotonin receptor 1A agonist/serotonin receptor 2A antagonist: flibanserinVasopressin receptor antagonists: tolvaptanPAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. PAXLOVID cannot be started immediately after discontinuation of any of the following medications due to the delayed offset of the recently discontinued CYP3A inducer:Anticancer drugs: apalutamideAnticonvulsant: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoinCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator potentiators: lumacaftor/ivacaftorAntimycobacterials: rifampinHerbal Products: St. John’s Wort (hypericum perforatum)There are limited clinical data available for PAXLOVID. Serious and unexpected adverse events may occur that have not been previously reported with PAXLOVID use.Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions: Initiation of PAXLOVID, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID, respectively. These interactions may lead to:Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medicationsClinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of PAXLOVIDLoss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistanceConsult Table 1 of the Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 1 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy; review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications.Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID. Cases of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported with ritonavir, a component of PAXLOVID (refer to NORVIR prescribing information). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.Because nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection.Adverse events in the PAXLOVID group (≥1%) that occurred at a greater frequency (≥5 subject difference) than in the placebo group were dysgeusia (6% and &lt;1%, respectively), diarrhea (3% and 2%), hypertension (1% and &lt;1%), and myalgia (1% and &lt;1%). The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment due to an adverse event were 2% in the PAXLOVID group and 4% in the placebo group.The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-authorization use of PAXLOVID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactionsGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nauseaGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: MalaiseRequired Reporting for Serious Adverse Events and Medication Errors: The prescribing healthcare provider and/or the provider’s designee is/are responsible for mandatory reporting of all serious adverse events and medication errors potentially related to PAXLOVID within 7 calendar days from the healthcare provider’s awareness of the event.Submit adverse event and medication error reports to FDA MedWatch using one of the following methods:Online: https://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmComplete and submit a postage-paid FDA Form 3500 and returning by mail/faxCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to request a reporting formIn addition, please provide a copy of all FDA MedWatch forms to: www.pfizersafetyreporting.com, or by fax (1-866-635-8337) or phone (1-800-438-1985).PAXLOVID is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring.Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect.Pregnancy: There are no available human data on the use of nirmatrelvir during pregnancy to evaluate for a drugassociated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published observational studies on ritonavir use in pregnant women have not identified an increase in the risk of major birth defects. Published studies with ritonavir are insufficient to identify a drugassociated risk of miscarriage. There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID-19 in pregnancy.Lactation: There are no available data on the presence of nirmatrelvir in human or animal milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A transient decrease in body weight was observed in the nursing offspring of rats administered nirmatrelvir. Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PAXLOVID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PAXLOVID or from the underlying maternal condition. Breastfeeding individuals with COVID19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID19.Contraception: Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception.Pediatrics: PAXLOVID is not authorized for use in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg. The safety and effectiveness of PAXLOVID have not been established in pediatric patients. The authorized adult dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg as observed in adults, and adults with similar body weight were included in the trial EPIC-HR.Systemic exposure of nirmatrelvir increases in renally impaired patients with increase in the severity of renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 to &lt;60 mL/min), reduce the dose of PAXLOVID to 150 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions. PAXLOVID is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR &lt;30 mL/min based on CKD-EPI formula) until more data are available; the appropriate dosage for patients with severe renal impairment has not been determined.No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is needed for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

As companies realign their operations and rebound from pandemic-driven constraints, the global pharmaceutical market is expected to reach $2135.18 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 7.7%. While North America was the biggest region in the pharmaceuticals market in 2021, the Middle East is expected to be the quickest growing market in the forecast period.According to the World Health Organization, one in every six people on the planet will be 60 or older by 2030. The population aged 60 and above will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 2.2 billion by 2050. This significant elevation in the aging population will boost the number of patients with chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer. This will lead to an increase in the demand for pharmaceuticals used for the treatment of these diseases, which will meaningfully impact market growth in the future. According to McKinsey, drug spending has increased, and dispensing revenue grew from $450 billion in 2019 to $500 billion in 2021. The growth was mainly driven by specialty drugs, which are now responsible for 40% of the total dispensing revenue. Ongoing innovation in drug development could boost specialty profit even more, and these profit pools are anticipated to increase at an 8% CAGR from 2021 to 2025. New technology-led pharmacies have entered the market and are steadily gaining share, featuring direct-to-consumer models with digital prescription management, automated workflows, and swift home delivery services. These innovative pharmaceutical firms will prompt higher competition in the market, which can potentially enhance the business models of larger retail and mail pharmacies as well, offering margin upside. Story continuesTo benefit from the boom in the pharmaceutical industry, investors usually lean towards firms like Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer Inc.

FOX News Digital remained the most engaged brand on social media in the competitive set for the quarter, with 46 million interactions on Meta Platform’s META Facebook, 46.3 million interactions on Instagram and 11.9 million interactions on Twitter.FOX News also placed first with YouTube video views among news brands for the 5th straight quarter (20th consecutive month), garnering over 848 million video views.Fox News has been the driving engine for Fox Corporation as it usually attracts more prime-time audiences than its rivals and is competitive with the more widely distributed broadcast networks as well.What is Aiding Growth at Fox?The Fox News Channel (“FNC”) has been benefiting from Fox Nation as it increased FNC’s subscriber base by approximately 80% in fiscal 2022. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.The Cable Network Programming segment, which generates 44% of Fox’s revenues, witnessed 7% year-over-year growth as affiliate and advertising fees increased.The increase in advertising revenues was primarily due to higher pricing at FOX News Media and an increase in the number of live events at the national sports networks.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox’s growing user base is not only driven by Fox News but also by Fox Business, which drove 151 million multiplatform views as of August.

This is intensified by offerings from tech giants like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Amazon, as they too have been fighting for ad dollars. Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram.The recent news of Fox being merged with News Corporation NWSA has also not been well accepted by investors as the latter faces headwinds from the print-advertising model getting redundant.

Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings The MethodWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.90bUS$7.99bUS$8.80bUS$8.38bUS$8.16bUS$8.06bUS$8.04bUS$8.08bUS$8.15bUS$8.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x11Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -2.58%Est @ -1.21%Est @ -0.25%Est @ 0.42%Est @ 0.89%Est @ 1.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$6.5kUS$7.0kUS$7.2kUS$6.4kUS$5.8kUS$5.4kUS$5.0kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$57bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$171bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$171b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$88bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$144b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$84.7, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PayPal Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.052. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For PayPal Holdings, we've put together three important items you should consider:Risks: You should be aware of the 3 warning signs for PayPal Holdings we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for PYPL's future outlook?

265,abe6ae7a-b4cf-3c5e-bc97-52683f7e62ce,IBM,2022-10-19,Drawing Inspiration From Stories in Asia Pacific: Training 1 Million Women and Girls in the Region,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drawing-inspiration-stories-asia-pacific-141500105.html,1666102500,STORY,['IBM'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 18, 2022 / IBMEmpowering women and girls to succeed in STEM studies and careers has long been one of my goals. I think it all started when I became an engineer and I didn't encounter many women in the field. Over the years I have become increasingly interested in creating opportunities through better and more equitable education. In my current role, I have the opportunity to take a stand and drive real progress on this issue. This is key because the absence of women in the tech field is not just something I've experienced firsthand, it is a widespread issue. Globally, women make up just 28% of graduates in engineering and 40% of those in computer sciences - skills vital for well-paying jobs that offer good work/life balance.That's why is important for me to be part of today's discussion at the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework in Los Angeles, where IBM pledged to train 1 million women and girls in the region over the next five years. This is another big moment on IBM's path to skills 30 million people globally by 2030, and another major milestone on this personal goal as a woman in STEM. But for me, it is also a time for reflection on the underlying challenges and the stories of success that empower us to keep pushing the needle.Let's start with the challenges. UNESCO has noted ""the underrepresentation of women in STEM careers in Asia Pacific has far-reaching implications, and that the exclusion of female professionals signifies a loss of ideas, perspectives and talent."" I completely agree. But this is not only about numbers. A more diverse STEM workforce with greater female representation is more creative, cohesive, and profitable. And a greater number of skilled professionals, by mentoring and setting the right example, can help bridge the persistent skills gap that has left many STEM jobs unfilled. How can we change the paradigm? I think there's no simple answer, but my team and I believe that with IBMers' passion and the right partnerships, we are capable of helping change the lives of women and girls.Story continuesWhat inspires me the most are the stories of individuals who have faced challenges but benefited from our work. For example, Navya, a young student in India, thought she couldn't pursue STEM because of her shyness and her household chores. Thanks to an inspiring math teacher and our STEM for Girls initiative, Navya is well on her way to becoming a math teacher herself!Another great example is Tejashwini, a 10th standard student from Saroornagar Govt school in Kothaguda. She is the first generation girl student from her family who is interested in science and wants to pursue a career in space. Her idol is Neil Armstrong and she wants to be the first person to step on Mars. As the daughter of a farmer and a homemaker, Tejashwini had no exposure to the kinds of careers available to women like her through STEM. Through coding classes, participation in hackathons, and career conversations, she now has an ambitious plan to fulfill her dream.Meanwhile in Japan, a working mother named Chika invested in her learning through IBM SkillsBuild during her third pregnancy and maternity leave. She returned to work after leave and was quickly promoted to a managerial role thanks to the workplace skills she gained which boosted her confidence. As a working mother myself - who works with many other working mothers - I know this is no easy feat and I admire Chika's passion and drive!Stories like this inspire us to continue the work we're doing all across Asia Pacific through partnerships and initiatives that are making a real difference in people's lives. For example, in Indonesia, IBM has already helped train more than 2,600 University students through the Digital Talent scholarship program. In Taiwan, IBM is training 20,000 young Taiwanese women, who spent 22,000 hours using IBM SkillsBuild, and we are connecting them with peers across countries who share their passion for STEM. Earlier this year, IBM announced a collaboration with UNCDF to deliver digital and workforce skills to women across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.Last, but not least, this could only be possible through the inspirational work of IBMers across the region. For example, in India, IBMers have provided mentorship over the last several years to 230,000 middle and high school girls across more than 1,850 government schools in 13 Indian states.This is a critical moment for inspiring and equipping women around the world with the resources they need to pursue a career in STEM, which can offer a unique opportunity for social and economic advancement. Women and girls like Chika, Tejashwini and Navya remind me why our work is so vital and illustrate the impact we can have when we collaborate and invest in education. I hope they more women and girls will be soon in good company with fellow STEM enthusiasts and future space explorers!IBM, Tuesday, October 18, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.ibm.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720840/Drawing-Inspiration-From-Stories-in-Asia-Pacific-Training-1-Million-Women-and-Girls-in-the-Region]"

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.United States President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that the US economy will avoid a recession despite rising interest rates and soaring inflation, a lethal economic combo, and even predicted that it will resume growth in the coming months. Economic experts do not share his point of view. A recent report by news platform Bloomberg reveals that a recession is effectively certain in the next 12 months. The prediction, based on a new Bloomberg Economics model, forecasts a higher recession probability across all timeframes. Per the model, the 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 has hit 100%, up from 65% in the previous update. Analysts Anna Wong and Eliza Winger are leading authors of the new report. The model made by the analysts uses a total of 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to predict the chance of a downturn at horizons of one month to two years. According to the model, the likelihood of a recession within 11 months has climbed to 73% from 30%, and the 10-month probability has risen to 25% from 0%, in the past few months. Investors can take advantage of the selloff at the stock market due to these economic conditions, which has led to a broad decrease in the share prices of solid businesses like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), to reap the rewards later. These firms also have resilient dividend yields and a dependable history of payouts that provide an extra layer of protection against volatile market conditions. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the Fortune 500 list and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy NowImage by Steve Buissinne from PixabayBest Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now12.

The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

(NASDAQ:WBA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

(NYSE:LUMN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Lumen – Lumen reported weak organic revenue growth and guided more weakness for 2022. We expect revenue growth to kick back in towards the end of 2022, and the huge FCF coupon helped offset value decline from the weaker guidance. The other factor weighing on the stock price was largest shareholder Temasek’s partial sale of its 10% position in the quarter, creating uncertainty and a share price overhang. We have a 13D filed and continue to urge the company to take steps to address the significant price-to-value gap, including continued share buybacks.”7. Altria Group, Inc.

We shared our thoughts on these regulations during the quarter, which are available here.MO Valuation. MO is up ~ 18% YTD (even accounting for the recent sell-off). We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the market’s multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x – 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.”6.

(NYSE:LOW) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)’s is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.COVID-19 was a transformational event for the US housing market, causing homeowners to invest significantly in their homes as they shifted nearly all their daily activities to the home environment, including work, school, and leisure. The increased use of the home during COVID, in turn, increased the need for repair, maintenance and remodel activity, which significantly benefited Lowe’s same-store sales. As consumers return to spending more time and money on out-of-the home activities the near-term demand for certain Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) categories has decreased. Moderation in DIY demand combined with increased mortgage rates and decreased housing affordability has caused many market participants to become concerned that the home improvement industry may give up a significant part of their COVID pandemic sales gains.While we expect that there will be some near-term volatility and continued moderation of DIY demand, growth remains strong for projects requiring professional installation (the “Pro” business) due to a substantial backlog of projects undertaken during COVID, which should support industry growth in the near-term. In addition, we believe the medium[1]term growth outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong as demand is likely to normalize at a materially higher level as compared to the pre-COVID era. For the decade prior to COVID, home improvement industry sales were notably depressed relative to their long-term averages as a percentage of overall consumer spend and GDP and have only now returned to their longer-term historical levels. Moreover, we believe COVID has permanently renewed consumers’ focus, appreciation, and utilization of their homes, which combined with higher home equity values, strong consumer balance sheets, low levels of home inventory for sale and an aging housing stock that requires an increasing level of maintenance, will likely result in a structurally higher level of ongoing home industry spending in the future. In the most recent quarter demand strengthened throughout the quarter as DIY consumers returned from summer vacations and focused on less seasonal home improvement projects…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Japanese Stocks to Invest in 202210 Best Long-Term Growth Stocks To Invest In Disclosure.

In other words, they avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. Instead, they believe that ""buying high and selling higher"" is the way to make far more money in lesser time.Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.It could be safer to invest in bargain stocks that have been witnessing price momentum recently. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, is pretty useful in identifying great momentum stocks, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.Marathon Petroleum (MPC) is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:A dash of recent price momentum reflects growing interest of investors in a stock. With a four-week price change of 9.4%, the stock of this refiner is certainly well-positioned in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. MPC meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 18.7% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for MPC is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.61. This indicates that the stock moves 61% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that MPC has a Momentum Score of A, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped MPC earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, MPC is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. MPC is currently trading at 0.33 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 33 cents for each dollar of sales.So, MPC appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to MPC, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick.

SubscribeTuesday, Oct. 19, 2022Today's newsletter is by Brian Sozzi, an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn. Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.If you aren’t listening, you aren’t learning — this is a motto I have long modeled my life around.So I put that into practical application at Yahoo Finance’s 9th annual All Markets Summit this week. Did I get every question I posited in these pages on Monday answered? Nope.Were some questions dodged a little? Sure, my team and I spoke with a host of well-known public company CEOs weeks before they are set to report earnings. It’s not like someone is going to say on live TV, “Hey Sozzi, we are going to beat on earnings by 10 cents — buy our stock.”But by and large, I was pleased with the dialogues. Here are a few hot takeaways from Yahoo Finance’s various chats.Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell suggested the company is beyond the worst of inventory issues that walloped profits in the second quarter. I am not surprised to see Jefferies out upgrading the stock on Tuesday in the wake of Cornell’s comments. The Jefferies analyst making the call — Corey Tarlowe — chatted with Yahoo Finance Live on his team’s new call. I don’t think other retailers have moved beyond their inventory gluts, so navigate this space with care.General Motors CEO Mary Barra speaks during a news conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan,September 13, 2022. REUTERS/Rebecca CookChipotle (CMG) CEO Brian Niccol told Brooke DiPalma and yours truly he is eyeing the potential impact from proposed changes to California’s minimum wage to $22 an hour. The company operates 15% of its 3,000 locations in California. In my humble view, the long-term inflationary outlook for wages in the fast-food sector is no way priced into today’s valuations. Food for thought as you do your valuation analysis.Hilton (HLT) CEO Chris Nassetta told Brad Smith and yours truly the travel rebound continues — something we have seen elsewhere, notably in the positive airline earnings announcements this month from Delta (DAL). If the economy is tanking into a recession, we aren’t seeing it in services like hotel stays.Story continuesParamount (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish struck an upbeat tone on the outlook for streaming in a chat with Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. It’s interesting to see streamer FuboTV (FUBO) come out with a positive earnings pre-announcement on Tuesday following that chat. It might be time to re-crunch the numbers on Roku (ROKU) into its earnings report.And in an interview with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer, General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra sure sounded like a person on a mission to deliver an EV future and challenge Tesla (TSLA). Bottom line: Tesla will not own the EV market the next five years as it has owned the last five. Feel free to tweet me some hate on this view.Now go forth and conquer.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.91 per share and $41.83 billion, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ third-quarter earnings per share has been revised downward by 13 cents over the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection, however, indicates a year-over-year decline of 25.6%. The top-line estimate implies year-over-year growth of 56.2%.In the last reported quarter, GM missed earnings estimates on better-than-expected revenues from North America, International and Financial segments. Over the trailing four quarters, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, with the average surprise being 18.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:General Motors Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company QuoteA Peek into Q3 PredictionsGeneral Motors was the top-selling carmaker in the United States in the third quarter of 2022.GM’s total third-quarter U.S. sales increased 24.3% year over year to 555,580 vehicles. While Buick deliveries skid 27.4% year over year, sales of the other three brands — Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac — posted double-digit year-over-year percentage gains. Sales of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac jumped 29.5%, 23.9% and 49.5% respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMNA segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 777,000 units, implying an increase from 423,000 units in the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate for wholesale shipments from the GMNA segment is 734,000 units for the to-be-reported quarter. Thanks to higher unit sales and rising vehicle prices, we project General Motors’ revenues from the GMNA unit to jump 58.3% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $34,397 million, implying a rise from $20,554 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for operating profit from the segment is pegged at $3,834 million, indicating an increase of 80.4% year over year. Our estimate for the same is $3,268 million.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMI segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 234,000 units, implying an increase from 113,000 units in the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate for wholesale shipments from the GMI segment is 199,000 units for the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $5,387 million, indicating a rise from $2,843 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. We project revenues of $5,481 million from the GMI unit. The consensus mark for the operating profit from the segment is pegged at $162 million, indicating a decline from $229 million. We expect profits from the segment to inch up 1.4% year over year.As for the GM Financial unit, the company’s gloomy 2022 outlook for the segment raises concern. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the GM Financial unit is pegged at $3,304 million, down from $3,354 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. We anticipate the profits from the segment to contract more than 7% year over year. The consensus mark for GM Financial’s operating profit is $968 million, down from $1,093 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for the GM Cruise unit’s operating loss stands at $432 million, widening from $286 million incurred in the year-ago period. We project the unit to post an operating loss of around $247 million.While higher-year-over-year shipments and revenues from GMNA and GMI segments bode well, weak forecasts from GM Financial and GM Cruise dim the overall third-quarter view. It is also to be noted that high commodity costs, including platinum group metals and steel prices, are likely to have played spoilsports. General Motors expects headwinds from commodity inflation and logistical challenges to be around more than $5 billion higher from 2021 levels as well as the prior projection. This further softens the outlook for the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Motors this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case hereEarnings ESP: It has an Earnings ESP of -13.99%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.64 per share is pegged 27 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The company has an Earnings ESP of +6.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Oshkosh’s to-be-reported quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.13 per share and $2.14 billion, respectively.

273,8301eb10-d445-3d58-8f21-68a62ce387ba,GM,2022-10-19,General Motors Company (GM) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-company-gm-earnings-140102124.html,1666101662,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.91 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +25.7%.Revenues are expected to be $41.83 billion, up 56.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.76% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for General Motors Company?For General Motors Company, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -13.99%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that General Motors Company will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that General Motors Company would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.14, delivering a surprise of -17.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.General Motors Company doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It said in September it needs to ""undertake significant work including re-negotiating multiple contracts with service providers that have lapsed, building out necessary infrastructure in Terminal 3 at Havana’s airport where United is being relocated.""Delta has the right to fly 21 weekly flights between the United States and Cuba, made up of 14 for Miami and 7 Atlanta flights. Delta suspended the flights during the COVID-19 pandemic and initially plans to resume Miami flights.Delta said it is working to relaunch flights but ""needs additional time to ensure reintroduction of safe, efficient, and sustainable service to Havana.""Delta expects it could take up to six months to re-establish necessary IT infrastructure to handle passenger needs in Havana and faces ""ongoing challenges in securing visas for personnel to travel to Cuba"" for both pre and post launch staffing.Last month the Biden administration agreed to expand U.S. flights to Havana, adding 13 weekly American Airlines departures from Miami and a weekly JetBlue Airways departure from Fort Lauderdale, on top of the typical six daily American Airlines flights and three JetBlue flights weekdays to Havana from the Florida airports.In June, USDOT lifted restrictions on flights to Cuba imposed under former President Donald Trump, including ending a prohibition on U.S. airline flights to smaller Cuban airports.In July, American Airlines received permission to resume service to some smaller Cuban airports.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Mark Porter and Chris Reese)]"

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.If you aren’t listening, you aren’t learning — this is a motto I have long modeled my life around.So I put that into practical application at Yahoo Finance’s 9th annual All Markets Summit this week. Did I get every question I posited in these pages on Monday answered? Nope.Were some questions dodged a little? Sure, my team and I spoke with a host of well-known public company CEOs weeks before they are set to report earnings. It’s not like someone is going to say on live TV, “Hey Sozzi, we are going to beat on earnings by 10 cents — buy our stock.”But by and large, I was pleased with the dialogues. Here are a few hot takeaways from Yahoo Finance’s various chats.Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell suggested the company is beyond the worst of inventory issues that walloped profits in the second quarter. I am not surprised to see Jefferies out upgrading the stock on Tuesday in the wake of Cornell’s comments. The Jefferies analyst making the call — Corey Tarlowe — chatted with Yahoo Finance Live on his team’s new call. I don’t think other retailers have moved beyond their inventory gluts, so navigate this space with care.General Motors CEO Mary Barra speaks during a news conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan,September 13, 2022. REUTERS/Rebecca CookChipotle (CMG) CEO Brian Niccol told Brooke DiPalma and yours truly he is eyeing the potential impact from proposed changes to California’s minimum wage to $22 an hour. The company operates 15% of its 3,000 locations in California. In my humble view, the long-term inflationary outlook for wages in the fast-food sector is no way priced into today’s valuations. Food for thought as you do your valuation analysis.Hilton (HLT) CEO Chris Nassetta told Brad Smith and yours truly the travel rebound continues — something we have seen elsewhere, notably in the positive airline earnings announcements this month from Delta (DAL). If the economy is tanking into a recession, we aren’t seeing it in services like hotel stays.Story continuesParamount (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish struck an upbeat tone on the outlook for streaming in a chat with Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. It’s interesting to see streamer FuboTV (FUBO) come out with a positive earnings pre-announcement on Tuesday following that chat. It might be time to re-crunch the numbers on Roku (ROKU) into its earnings report.And in an interview with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer, General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra sure sounded like a person on a mission to deliver an EV future and challenge Tesla (TSLA). Bottom line: Tesla will not own the EV market the next five years as it has owned the last five. Feel free to tweet me some hate on this view.Now go forth and conquer.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October. The aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic are still being felt all over the globe. The virus saw industrial output collapse and led to widespread layoffs and income loss. This in turn motivated central banks to reduce interest rates to stimulate economic activity and give out cash assistance to help families navigate the tough economic environment.However, all these actions were not without consequence and now, the result of excess capital flowing into the market has resulted in increasing the demand for the products and as a result spurring price growth or inflation. To counter inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve are raising interest rates to take this capital out of the industry, and this will lead to a recession as businesses find it hard to find capital and end up reducing output.Commenting on the risk of a recession, hedge fund owner Bill Ackman was optimistic and in an interview given in October 2022, he said:Look I don't think it's knowable whether or not we're going to have a recession. You know it used to be we had economic cycles with recessions, it's been an awfully long time, but if the Federal Reserve got behind in raising rates and now they're gonna have to be more aggressive. I mean you look at what's going on in housing, people got used to a 3% mortgage rate and now it's 6%+ and that's causing the housing market to slow down fairly rapidly. Housing's a very important part of our economy. So if rate rises have that effect more broadly, then I think it's likely that you're gonna have a recession. If the Fed raises rates pretty quickly, which was our kind of recommendation more than a year ago, and you can sort of cut off inflation and get it trending in the right direction, then there don't have to be as severe and don't have to, if you will force us into a severe recession. But I think sometime in 2023 it's absolutely within the realm of possibility that we're gonna have a recession for sure.Story continuesEconomists polled by Bloomberg Magazine are more pessimistic than Mr. Ackman, with the latest report outlining that by October 2023, there is a 100% chance of a recession. Another poll of different economists suggests that the probability of a recession is at 60% over the next 12 months, up by 10% since last month's estimates.Therefore, a potential recession merits a different investment approach and involves selecting companies and industries that supply products that are essential. In this piece, we take a look at some of these stocks, with the top picks being Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).10 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October Photo by Darla Hueske on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe studied different industries that have the best odds of stable demand during an economic downturn and then selected the top players in these sectors.

There's so much inventory that has flooded the store ahead of the holiday seasons. How are they going to be able to work through that?COREY TARLOWE: Sure. So there are three key pillars to our upgrade today. The first one is inventory, as you mentioned. Second one is margins, and the third one is valuation. I'll start with inventory because that seems to be the most topical subject today. On inventory, our proprietary work illustrates that the headwinds that Target and other retailers face might not be as bad as what people think.And why do I say this? Well, we've done some really differentiated work on this topic. So we looked at inventory cycles over the last two decades. And what did we find out? That when analyzing inventory growth and sales growth and profit growth throughout the last two decades, when inventory growth peaks, you tend to see a trough, or a bottoming, in sales and gross profit growth about five quarters after inventory growth peaks.And what are we seeing right now? Well, most of the retail coverage that I focus on is continuing to go like this. But for Target, in the last quarter, we saw an inflection, right, where we saw a peaking in inventory growth. So what does that mean? At some point, between now and five quarters from now, you're going to see a bottoming in sales and gross profit growth and an inflection in the stock.Story continuesAnd after talking with the company, Target only has a couple of hundred million dollars of excess warm weather apparel inventory. And you see this in our note today. We publish pictures of this in our store checks. And this is already in the guide that's already been reduced. Earnings revisions are now down, I believe, close to 40% in the last nine months.And the balance of the inventory should improve meaningfully from here and skew much more towards consumables, which is still 45% of Target's business. So that helps to add a substantial layer of defensibility for this business in what are, frankly, as the CEO called it yesterday, unusual economic times. And he even cited that he's seeing some healthy spending trends, despite the atypical environment in which we're in.BRIAN SOZZI: I'm glad you mentioned Brian Cornell because he made those comments here on Yahoo Finance at our All Markets Summit. And I really enjoyed talking to him. But Corey, take a listen to this because I asked Brian about the inventory challenges they are having. Here's what he told us.BRIAN CORNELL: You know, back in June, we made a pretty bold and decisive decision. We said, all right, inventories have built up. Consumer shopping habits have changed. They've moved into different categories. And we said we're going to get out in front of us. So for Target, we put that inventory problem behind us. And now we can focus on great execution, delighting our guests, getting ready for the big holiday season.So we were pretty decisive and said, we're not going to just let this roll into the next quarter. We'll deal with it upfront. And now we're excited that we're ready to play for the holiday season.BRIAN SOZZI: So Corey, it's not just Target. I hear what you're saying on Target. It sounds like, just my vibe talking to Brian, that they are working through this inventory, maybe an issue that is going in the rearview mirror for them. But what about the broader industry? I mean, Walmart exited that second quarter with a lot of other inventory. Department stores, high levels of inventory. I mean, how big a problem is this going to be for the retail universe at large this holiday season?COREY TARLOWE: It's likely going to be pretty significant in categories that are more discretionary in nature. And that's part of the reason that we are a little bit hesitant on certain discretionary retailers. But Target, frankly, is one where we see a lot of opportunity. And why? Well, let's take a look at the margin.For example, in that clip that you just showed, Brian Cornell talked about how they had cleared a lot of inventory in the second quarter. The business drove close to a 1% EBIT margin in the second quarter, which is rather uncharacteristic for a business that drives typically an EBIT margin over the last decade close to 7%. So clearly, the last quarter was an aberration. And a lot of these self-inflicted or COVID induced wounds are likely to lead to probably a subdued margin this year from an EBIT perspective, so probably around 4% to 5%.But as we look to next year, we think that a 6% or more margin would probably be reasonable. And I don't think that the street is quite yet focused on that, particularly given the near-term hurdles that exist as a result of elevated inventories in the environment that you point out and holiday. But on holiday, what I would say is that we've heard from several retailers now that consumers are-- while they're being more intentional, are still spending on holiday.So I was at a conference a few weeks ago. The CEO of Walmart US had cited a strong tailgate season, a strong back to school season. And then just a few weeks ago, the CEO of Costco had even-- or CFO, excuse me-- had mentioned that he's seeing strong momentum in Christmas and Halloween inventory that has already hit the stores. So I think that that does, despite the elevated inventory environment that we're in, bode quite well for the holiday season ahead.JULIE HYMAN: Hey, Corey. It wasn't just Target that you are looking at here. You upgraded Target, but you still like Walmart also. And so it sounds like you don't think there's going to be a zero sum situation here. Do you think Walmart is also going to be OK on the inventory front? And also, it sounds like you think they'll benefit from people maybe trading down and trying to save money a little bit.COREY TARLOWE: Absolutely. So part of the reason that we do like Walmart is that it's a value leader, and it benefits from a trade down. But beyond that, we took this a step further. And we said, OK, if it's going to benefit from a trade down, how much do we see it benefiting over the next 12 to 24 months?And the reality is that we think that-- when we went through a really highly differentiated and unique analysis, that we think Walmart can drive over 100 basis points to its same store sales as a result of trade down in grocery. And that could drive upside to consensus comp numbers, not only this year, but next year, too. And our estimates are above consensus this year and next year by over 3%. There's upside to valuation.This business is trading at 19 times two-year forward earnings versus its historical average of 22 times. So it's trading at a three-turn discount to historical average. And that range is typically about 17 to 27 times. So it's actually trading even toward the lower end of that range, which means that there's plenty of upside from not only a numbers perspective, but a valuation perspective as well.JULIE HYMAN: Corey, thanks for joining us. Good to talk to you. Corey Tarlowe, Jefferies senior research analyst, talking to us about the retailers today. Appreciate it.]"

We've got a couple of big gainers here on the board, Netflix, United, Intuitive Surgical, and JB Hunt, all has to do with earnings. Let's kick it off with Netflix, the stock popping here after hours, a very, very strong subscriber growth number. That's the reason that we're seeing a 13 and 1/2% jump in shares after hours, 2.4 million subscribers added during its most recent quarter.They added customers in every region here, surging past what Wall Street was looking for. That's a big reason why you're seeing that jump today. The company, though, did offer revenue guidance that came in just a bit light. But it doesn't look like that's holding too much weight, at least for now.The company says that it is on the path to reaccelerate growth. A sequential decline in revenue was entirely due to the strong dollar. Taking a look at the past three months, Netflix, you can see, has gotten some of its momentum back with shares up 26%. On a year-to-date basis, though, we are still well in the red, off just around 60%.Let's take a look at United, another company out with earnings here after the bell. You're seeing the stock up just around 7 and 1/2%, beating on both the top and bottom lines, revenue of $12.9 billion, adjusted EPS of $2.81. The company saying that COVID recovery trend to overcome some of those recessionary pressures, very similar to what we heard from Delta when Delta gave that upbeat guidance here for the holiday quarter. Taking a look at the past three months, you can see United still in the red, though, off just around 5%.Taking a look at Intuitive Surgical, another mover here to the upside, up just over 8%, a beat on both the top and bottom line. Revenue for the third quarter, coming in above 11%-- up 11% from a year ago at $1.56 billion, EPS at $1.19. That was better than what the Street was looking for.The company did say, though, that profit did decline from a year ago because of rising expenses. Doesn't look like the Street is too worried about that, at least for now. Over the past three months, the stock off just around 6%.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business has differed by geography and region. COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Company’s procedure volumes.“Intuitive’s core business strengthened this quarter despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and some lingering pandemic impacts,” said Gary Guthart, Intuitive CEO. “Our da Vinci installed base grew to meet procedure demand, and we also see a continued increase in system utilization, which is healthy for our customers and the business.”Additional supplemental financial and procedure information has been posted to the Investor Relations section of the Intuitive website at https://isrg.gcs-web.com/.Webcast and Conference Call InformationIntuitive will hold a teleconference at 1:30 p.m. PDT today to discuss the third quarter 2022 financial results.

(“EPS”), and non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding items such as amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation (“SBC”) and long-term incentive plan expenses, and other special items. Long-term incentive plan expense relates to phantom share awards granted in China by the Company’s Intuitive-Fosun joint venture to its employees that vest over four years and can remain outstanding for seven to ten years. These awards are valued based on certain key performance metrics. Accordingly, they are subject to significant volatility based on the performance of these metrics and are not tied to performance of the Company’s business within the period. The Company presents constant currency revenue to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to its historical performance. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors, because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company’s business.Constant currency revenue growth. The Company calculates constant currency revenue by translating current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the increase in the current period constant currency revenue over the prior period revenue. Third quarter 2022 as reported revenue increased 11% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 4% unfavorable impact on third quarter 2022 revenue. Third quarter 2022 constant currency revenue increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2021.Non-GAAP gross profit. The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit, excluding amortization of intangible assets and SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses.Non-GAAP income from operations. The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, and a gain on the sale of a business.Non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and EPS. The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., excluding amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, litigation charges and recoveries, a gain on the sale of a business, gains (losses) on strategic investments, adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest in joint venture, net of the related tax effects, and tax adjustments, including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements as well as the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers, because the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company’s operating results. The Company’s calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. divided by non-GAAP diluted shares, which are calculated as GAAP weighted-average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as amortization of intangible assets, SBC and long-term incentive plan expenses, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with SBC arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC expense has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and non-GAAP EPS together with net income attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. calculated in accordance with GAAP.INTUITIVE SURGICAL, INC.

The Company made these changes to its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures based on its understanding of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) current views on this practice from knowledge of communications between the SEC and a number of pharmaceutical and life sciences companies and independent registered public accounting firms. Historical non-GAAP measures presented in our earnings release have been adjusted for comparability. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the impact of this adjustment was a decrease of non-GAAP income from operations of $0.3 million and $9.9 million, respectively, or $0.00 and $0.02 to the diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., net of tax. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the impact was a decrease of non-GAAP income from operations of $0.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively, or $0.00 and $0.01 to the diluted net income per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., net of tax.(2) For the three months ended September 30, 2022, tax adjustments included: (a) excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation arrangements of $(18.1) million, or $(0.05) per diluted share; (b) tax impact related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets of $7.0 million, or $0.02 per diluted share; and (c) other tax adjustments effects determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate of $(42.2) million, or $(0.12) per diluted share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, tax adjustments included: (a) excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation arrangements of $(80.4) million, or $(0.22) per diluted share; (b) tax impact related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets of $21.0 million, or $0.06 per diluted share; and (c) other tax adjustments effects determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate of $(115.3) million, or $(0.32) per diluted share.Contact: Investor Relations(408) 523-2161]"

297,aaa387dc-a6c7-3989-8fd4-6e62b9096b4b,NAVI,2022-10-19,Navient (NAVI) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/navient-navi-expected-beat-earnings-140102129.html,1666101662,STORY,['NAVI'],"[Navient (NAVI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis student loan servicing company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.4%.Revenues are expected to be $291.89 million, down 2.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.95% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Navient?For Navient, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.56%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Navient will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Navient would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.92, delivering a surprise of +16.46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Navient appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsDiscover (DFS), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Consumer Loans industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.67 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +3.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.35 billion, up 20.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Discover has been revised 0.3% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.93%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Discover will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

298,03a9f4e2-a7e5-3bdf-843b-30fee6f7069c,CSX,2022-10-19,What Is CSX Corporation's (NASDAQ:CSX) Share Price Doing?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-corporations-nasdaq-csx-share-120102241.html,1666180862,STORY,['CSX'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$34.48 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$26.51. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether CSX's current trading price of US$28.41 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at CSX’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for CSX What Is CSX Worth?Great news for investors – CSX is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $36.92, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, CSX’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from CSX?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of CSX, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 10.0%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since CSX is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSX for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSX. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

299,287ed732-e016-399f-a881-4b328ee5aa5c,CSX,2022-10-19,Canadian National (CNI) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-national-cni-earnings-expected-140102951.html,1666101662,STORY,"['CNI', 'CSX']","[The market expects Canadian National (CNI) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +25.6%.Revenues are expected to be $3.29 billion, up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.09% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CN?For CN, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.66%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CN will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CN would post earnings of $1.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of +10.22%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CN doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry, CSX (CSX), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +16.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.78 billion, up 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for CSX has been revised 0.7% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.26%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CSX will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After two years of travel bans, restrictions and lockdowns, Americans are set to hit the road. Thanksgiving and Christmas are normally two of the most traveled holidays in the fourth quarter.""Leisure travel is more than back. It's exceeding in many cases pre-pandemic levels,"" Jonathan Kletzel, PwC U.S. airline and travel practice leader, told Travel + Leisure, noting that 47% of survey respondents hinted that they plan to travel over the holiday break. Kletzel explained that almost half of those, or 46%, plan to do so by plane, up from 40% in 2021 and 33% in 2020, quoted on Travel+Leisure.Outlook for Cruise Sector UpbeatUBS analysts are now overweight on the cruise sector due to its stronger occupancy recovery and robust bookings. The investment firm upgraded Norwegian (NCLH), following which the stock added 11.6% on Oct 12. The news acted as a cornerstone for the entire sector. Hence, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Carnival Corporation &amp; Plc CCL added about 11% and 10%, respectively, on the same day.Norwegian Cruise has kept pricing nicely ahead of the 2019 levels. The company told investors last week that occupancy levels would be around 82% in the third quarter, up from 65% in the second quarter.  Royal Caribbean Group’s occupancy is rebounding even more strongly following the pandemic and prices for cruises booked both for the second half of 2022 and 2023 are at record levels. Cruise operators are finally easing COVID restrictions, which may boost the sector’s dwindling recovery.Airlines Flying High TooAccording to Hopper's 2022 Holiday Travel Outlook released in September, the average price of a domestic plane ticket is $350 for Thanksgiving travel and $463 for Christmas travel. Thanksgiving prices are 22% higher than in 2019 and 43% more than in 2021. Christmas airfares are currently averaging 31% higher than 2019, and 39% higher than last year.Story continuesInternational airfare is currently averaging $795 per ticket this Thanksgiving, up 25% from 2019 and up 41% year over year. Prices for international travel will rise slowly as Thanksgiving comes closer. International airfare has risen 26% from 2019 and 20% from 2018 to $1,300 per ticket this year.A combination of factors like jet fuel prices, fewer flights scheduled and two years of pent-up holiday travel demand should drive Thanksgiving and Christmas airfares to their highest in the last five years (read: 5 Top-Ranked Sector ETFs to Buy for Q4).ETFs in FocusDefiance Hotel, Airline, And Cruise ETF CRUZThe underlying BlueStar Global Hotels, Airlines, and Cruises Index is rules-based and consists of globally listed stocks of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues from the passenger airline, hotel and resort, or cruise industries.

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices Analog Devices Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, for US$2.3m worth of shares, at about US$166 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$139. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year Analog Devices insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Analog Devices Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Analog Devices. Specifically, Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology Vivek Jain ditched US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Analog Devices Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Analog Devices insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$238m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.So What Do The Analog Devices Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. At Simply Wall St, we found 3 warning signs for Analog Devices that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Analog Devices may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Although the bank’s earnings are expected to have declined from the year-ago reported figure, revenues are likely to have increased.This Birmingham, AL-based player’s second-quarter 2022 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on a rise in fee income and net interest income (NII). Average loan and deposit balances also improved. However, rising expenses and provision for credit losses affected the bottom line. Capital ratios continued to deteriorate in the quarter.Regions Financial has a decent earnings surprise history. RF's results surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, missing the mark in the other, the average beat being 10.1%.Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseRegions Financial Corporation price-eps-surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteRF’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 59 cents per share has moved marginally north in the past week. The figure indicates a 10.6% fall from the year-ago reported number. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.81 billion, suggesting 12.1% growth from the year-ago reported figure.Factors at PlayLoans: While lending activity improved sequentially in the third quarter, the pace of loan growth across most categories slowed as the quarter progressed. Per the Fed’s latest data, residential real estate loans and consumer loans slightly moderated in the third quarter from the second quarter.Commercial real estate loans, as well as commercial and industrial loan growth, accelerated in the quarter under review. Amid this, the company’s commercial loans (comprising commercial and industrial lending, as well as commercial real estate lending), which are notable parts of its loan portfolio, are likely to have improved in the quarter under review.Story continuesRegions Financial is anticipated to have benefited from its strong loan pipeline and the past acquisition of EnerBank USA.NII: In the third quarter, the Fed hiked interest rates by 150 basis points (bps). With this, the level of the policy rate reached 3-3.25%, the highest since 2008. Hence, with Regions Financial’s solid asset-sensitive position, $1.2 billion securities added in the second quarter and decent loan growth, the bank is expected to have seen NII and net interest margin (NIM) improvements in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII suggests a rise of 10.6% to $1.22 billion sequentially. Management expects third-quarter NII to grow 8-10%.Non-Interest Revenues: Geopolitical tensions and uncertainty due to recession fears have dampened the equity market performance. Wealth management income is likely to have declined due to this.The fading stimulus, rising rates and high inflation are expected to have increased transactions and spend volumes, thereby supporting card and ATM fees in the quarter.The removal of overdraft protection transfer charges and non-sufficient funds fees are likely to have had an adverse impact on revenues from service charges on deposits.Mortgage originations, both purchase and refinancing, continued to decline in the third quarter. Also, in the third quarter, mortgage rates increased, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage crossing the 6% mark in September. The climb in mortgage rates has taken a toll on the origination market. Hence, the company is likely to have continued seeing declines in its mortgage banking fee. The ZCE for the same is pinned at $41.84 million, indicating an 11% sequential decline.Global deal-making shrank for the third consecutive quarter. Raging inflation, the equity markets’ rout and fears of a recession dealt a blow to business sentiments and plans for expansion via acquisitions. Thus, deal volume and total value numbers crashed in the third quarter.With a decrease in global mergers and acquisition volumes, the company’s capital market income is likely to have been affected. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market income is pinned at $91 million, indicating an 18.8% decline from the quarter-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total non-interest income is pegged at $584 million for the quarter under review, indicating an 8.7% fall sequentially.Expenses: A rising expense base primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, as well as some inflationary pressures, is likely to have continued hurting the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. Recent acquisitions and investments in technology are likely to have hiked costs, thereby affecting bottom-line growth.In the third quarter, Regions Financial wasasked by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to pay $191 million in redressal and fines for levying illegal overdraft fees on customer accounts from 2018 to 2021.The financial impacts of the settlement will be reflected in RF’s third-quarter 2022 results and will result in higher expenses.Asset Quality: With the anticipated rise in loan balance and expectations of economic slowdown due to geopolitical and inflation concerns, the company is anticipated to have built reserves in the third quarter.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:RF does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat this time around.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Regions Financial has an Earnings ESP of -0.40%.Zacks Rank: Regions Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Meanwhile, the Dow gained 1.12%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.02%.Visa will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 25, 2022. On that day, Visa is projected to report earnings of $1.86 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 14.81%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.55 billion, up 15.12% from the prior-year quarter.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.69% lower. Visa is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Visa is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 22.25. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 15.87, so we one might conclude that Visa is trading at a premium comparatively.Meanwhile, V's PEG ratio is currently 1.33. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Financial Transaction Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.95 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector.

308,ffcf7c2e-f72b-3b14-8e20-d53d07a42ed6,V,2022-10-19,Visa (V) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-v-earnings-expected-grow-140102952.html,1666101662,STORY,['V'],"[The market expects Visa (V) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global payments processor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.8%.Revenues are expected to be $7.55 billion, up 15.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Visa?For Visa, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.52%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Visa will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Visa would post earnings of $1.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.98, delivering a surprise of +13.79%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Visa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Aiming to diversify and drive greater inclusion to the C-suite levels of the hospitality industry, the center’s mission is to provide students with necessary leadership skills and experiential opportunities.“I can think of no better tribute to the amazing legacy of Arne Sorenson than to focus on educating and advancing future leaders of the hospitality industry,” said J.W. “Bill” Marriott, Jr., executive chairman and chairman of the board, Marriott International.“Our industry needs a pipeline of diverse leadership talent and that’s exactly what this Center will achieve,” he added.According to Howard University, the leadership program focuses on “traditional and experiential learning opportunities.”“The need for U.S. C-suites to be more diverse is urgent and necessary, and we are in the position to help hold the industry accountable,” said Dr. Anthony D. Wilbon, dean of the Howard University School of Business.The PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) firm was selected to help blueprint the pipeline, using business, experience, and technology (BXT) co-creation and collaboration techniques.

Attendees addressed Black history related to the industry through discussions on how to effect change in executive suite diversity.“The gathering of some of the industry’s ‘who’s who’ was a response to Arne’s call but also a recognition that Howard University was in a great position to hold the hospitality industry accountable on inclusion and diversity,” said PwC Partner, Lawrence Ballard, told AfroTech.A report by Castell Project on Black Representation in Hospitality Leadership found that Black employees represent 13.6% of hospitality industry employment.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Globant (GLOB) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.28 a share 30 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 17, 2022.Globant's Earnings ESP sits at 1.39%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.28 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26.GLOB is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Verizon Communications (VZ) as well.Verizon Communications, which is readying to report earnings on October 21, 2022, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now.

And unfortunately for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) shareholders, the stock is a lot lower today than it was a year ago. The share price is down a hefty 58% in that time. To make matters worse, the returns over three years have also been really disappointing (the share price is 49% lower than three years ago). The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 32% in the last three months.Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for Stanley Black &amp; Decker To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unhappily, Stanley Black &amp; Decker had to report a 43% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 58% is actually more than the EPS drop. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Stanley Black &amp; Decker shareholders are down 57% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 25%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 8% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to read about some more Jim Cramer stocks, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.High growth names at the stock market have been battered in the past few months as rising rates and soaring inflation push investors away from risky bets. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, predicted this turn of events earlier this year. Cramer, who was also at Goldman Sachs during the early part of his career, has recently made the bold claim that finance stocks were replacing tech names as “market leaders” as the Fed was allowing these firms incredible leeway. Cramer said that he thought that the group had the potential to become a leader again, but the banks could never pull it off because the Fed kept rates so low that it was hard for them to make money. However, he underlined that this set of circumstances was changing as the Fed was allowing these companies to make a ton of money. He explained this by saying that banks were paying next to nothing for deposits and then reinvesting that money risk-free in short-term Treasury, whose rates were climbing. Cramer also remarked that unemployment would increase if the central bank takes the federal funds rate close to 5%, which could result in a high number of bad loans for banks. However, the journalist investor noted that banks would be able to offset any damage even though there will be more defaults and delinquencies, but the net interest margin expansion will more than make up for it. Some of the stocks that Cramer has been monitoring lately include Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). Our MethodologyThese were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Cramer made on these equities during his appearances on news platform CNBC. An extensive database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the popularity of each stock among hedge funds.Story continues11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy NowBest Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now11. Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32     Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) operates as a pizza company internationally. It is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. On October 12, Cramer placed the firm among a basket of companies whose shares could pop in the coming weeks and months. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.2 billion in Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), compared to 27 in the previous quarter worth $1.8 billion.Just like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, LRT Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally (…read more)10. Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32    Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) provides care products and services in the United States and Canada. It is one of the top Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. During the Lightning Round of his show on October 11, the former hedge fund manager outlined his bullish stance on the company. While answering a viewer question about the firm, Cramer said that it was “a good stock to own” in the present macro environment. On October 7, Truist analyst Tobey Sommer initiated coverage of Service Corporation  International (NYSE:SCI) stock with a Buy rating and a $72 price target, citing the company's stable demand stream, recent operational improvements, and excellent track record in the return of shareholder capital. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $576.5 million in Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI), compared to 29 in the previous quarter worth $357 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Steel City Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our short position in Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) began to bear fruit when the company reported 2Q’22 results and I think there continues to be room for the shares to fall further. At the company’s analyst day in May, management articulated long-term financial targets that included EPS growth of 8-12%, inclusive of 5-7% from organic activity and another 3-5% from inorganic activity (M&amp;A and greenfield expansion). There are lots of moving variables associated with the outlook, but ultimately, reaching the goal is predicated upon continued strong growth in pre-need cemetery sales (which have favorable revenue recognition conditions). My view is that the recent boom in pre-need activity was a function of 1) a consumer flush with cash and “wealth-effect” driven spending with markets at all-time highs and 2) elevated awareness driven by COVID mortality, and that sooner-or-later the attractiveness of pre-paying $10,000+ for a cemetery plot that you (hopefully) won’t need for many years would become less attractive. When the company reported 2Q results pre-need growth unexpectedly rolled over. As investors come to terms with the fact that SCI is unlikely to deliver on its long-term guidance, shares should continue to retreat.”9. Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34     Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) designs, manufactures, and sells power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products. It is one of the major Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. The former hedge fund manager recently said the firm was among a group of stocks that could pop in the weeks ahead as the bear market comes to an end. On August 8, JPMorgan analyst Mark maintained an Overweight rating on Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) stock and raised the price target to $421 from $415, noting the firm would benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Impax Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), with 846,161 shares worth more than $177 million. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“On a securities level, our top contributors (includes) Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). All these businesses performed well fundamentally. For Generac, the leading provider of residential standby generators, fundamentals remained strong, but there was little to highlight from the quarter.”8. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc.

Top-line results were strong, too, reported at $4.4 billion and reflecting a strong 13% Y/Y uptick.Dan Durn, EVP and CFO, said, “Adobe achieved record revenue and strong profitability in the quarter, demonstrating that our products are mission-critical to individuals, small businesses and the world’s largest enterprises.”Story continuesBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNvidiaNvidia shares currently trade at a 47.5X forward earnings multiple, certainly not cheap by any stretch. However, the current value is nowhere near the steep 2021 highs of 93.5X during the semiconductor melt-up.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhile the company’s Gaming revenue has taken a hit amid a slowdown in demand, NVDA’s Data Center results are definitely worth highlighting – Data Center revenue climbed 61% Y/Y to $3.8 billion in its latest quarter, with sales from hyperscale customers nearly doubling.Nvidia’s Automotive results are undoubtedly worth a spotlight as well; Automotive revenue climbed a double-digit 45% Y/Y and 59% sequentially, with the strong growth driven by Auto AI Solutions (this includes AI Cockpit and Self-Driving revenue).While the company’s Gaming revenue has experienced quite a slowdown, other areas of its business are still enjoying strong growth.NVDA’s earnings are forecasted to decline by more than 20% in its current fiscal year (FY23), but things kick back into the green for FY24, with estimates calling for 30% growth.Further, revenue is forecasted to climb a marginal 1.8% in FY23 and a sizable 14% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabetAlphabet shares could be the most enticing of all three – the company’s shares trade at a 19.2X forward earnings multiple, reflecting a 7% discount relative to its Zacks Computer and Technology sector.Further, the current value reflects a sizable 32% discount relative to the five-year median of 26.7X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGOOGL knows how to generate cash – Alphabet came in hot in its latest print, reporting quarterly free cash flow of $12.6 billion, the fourth highest of any S&amp;P 500 company in Q2.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s Google Cloud platform has been a notable success; in its latest quarter, Google Cloud revenue came in at $6.3 billion, reflecting a stellar 35.6% Y/Y uptick and a 9% sequential increase.Keeping a Long-Term MindsetIt’s been anything but fun for tech stocks in 2022, with a vast number witnessing double-digit percentage share price declines.However, amid all the negativity, long-term investors have been presented with a buying opportunity not seen in some time.Of course, there is always risk to the downside, but that’s why investors need to keep a long-term mindset, especially during uncertain times.Many strong companies, such as Nvidia NVDA, Adobe ADBE, and Alphabet GOOGL, have seen their valuation multiples pull back notably.Implementing a dollar-cost average strategy would be great for those looking to build up their positions and reap the rewards on the way back up.

(Reuters) - Oracle Corp and Nvidia Corp on Tuesday announced they are expanding their partnership and adding tens of thousands of Nvidia’s chips to boost artificial intelligence- related computational work in Oracle’s cloud.The expanded partnership comes as more companies use AI and the AI models become more complex, requiring a ramp-up in data center infrastructure investments.While the companies declined to say how much the additional hardware would cost or how many chips were being sold, they said the expansion includes Nvidia’s A100 and its most advanced H100 GPUs or graphics processing units.Those two chips were also put on an export control list to China over a month ago. Nvidia said at the time it had included $400 million of potential sales to China which could be impacted in its third-quarter earnings outlook.As of August, Nvidia’s market share of so-called accelerator chips inside the world's six biggest clouds' infrastructure grew to 85%, according to a note by brokerage Jefferies on Monday.

In recent years, the company has experienced periods of increased raw material costs. Changes in raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for the same, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms can materially and adversely affect Ecolab’s consolidated operations.Estimate TrendEcolab is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2022.

BIO is expected to report third-quarter 2022 results shortly.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of $3.38 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 37.4%. Moreover, earnings beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters. The trailing four-quarter average surprise is 46.75%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayBio-Rad’s Life Science segment has been registering robust revenue growth over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to have continued in the third quarter on the back of sustained sales gains in terms of the company’s process media, western blotting, Droplet Digital PCR and qPCR products. The company has been witnessing strong growth in the biopharma market for the Droplet Digital PCR platform, which is expected to have made significant contributions to the third-quarter top line.However, due to the Russia-Ukraine war situation,supply chain constraints have been impacting instrument placements. As a result of these constraints as well as the global inflationary situation, we expect the company’s Life science business to have experienced a year-over-year decline in revenues.BioRad Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBioRad Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseBioRad Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | BioRad Laboratories, Inc. QuoteFurther, a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases across many countries compared to the year-ago period is likely to have hit demand for Bio-Rad's COVID-related products, including molecular qPCR and ddPCR instruments and assays, antibody tests and quality controls, thus impacting the company’s top line.Per our model, Bio-Rad is expected to report a 3.2% year-over-year drop in Life Science revenues in Q3.Bio-Rad earlier noted that it expects to see accelerated growth within the Clinical Diagnostics segment in 2022, driven by its continued focus on laboratory workflow productivity, quality control value proposition, and new opportunities in molecular diagnostics. This uptrend was reflected in the second quarter, which was influenced by strong business generation within blood-typing, quality control and clinical immunology. We expect this trend to have continued through the third quarter on the back of the continued opening of the economy.Story continuesOur model projects 4.5% year-over-year improvement in Clinical Diagnostics revenues in Q3.Estimate PictureThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bio-Rad’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $690.1 million, which implies a decline of 7.6% from the year-ago figure.The consensus estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $2.59, suggesting a fall of 30.2% from the prior-year reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

WST is well-poised for growth, backed by the robust Proprietary Products segment and sustained strength in research and development (R&amp;D). However, foreign exchange volatility remains a woe.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 45.5% compared with the industry's decline of 21% so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 25.4% in the same period.West Pharmaceutical — with a market capitalization of $18.33 billion — is a leading global manufacturer in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 27.2% over the next five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 9.43%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey CatalystsThe proprietary products business continues to exhibit sustained strength and is an important contributor to WST's top line. This segment's customers primarily comprise several of the major biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug companies globally that incorporate components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to patients.Sales improved 13.1% organically in the second quarter of 2022. High-value products (components and devices) accounted for more than 70% of segment sales and delivered double-digit organic sales growth. Consumer demand for NovaPure, Envision and Daikyo Crystal Zenith components and self-injection devices led to the upside. Solid double-digit organic sales growth in the Biologics and Generics market units and mid-single-digit organic sales growth in the Pharma market unit are other quarterly highlights. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin also augurs well for the company.West Pharmaceutical maintains its research-scale production facilities and laboratories for creating new products and provides contract engineering design and development services to help customers with new product developments.Story continuesThe company continues to pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes, injectable containers, advanced injections, and safety and administration systems. In the second quarter of 2022, the company's R&amp;D expenses increased 4.3% from the prior-year quarter. West Pharmaceutical remains committed to seeking new innovative opportunities for the acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies. WST is focused on its objective to connect dots throughout science and technology to fulfill ideas for potential value creation.Factors Hurting the StockThe growing exposure to international markets makes the company susceptible to adverse foreign exchange volatility. Unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect West Pharmaceutical's international sales. On the second-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company projected forex headwind on revenues of $190 million, up from the previous expectation of $115 million.Moreover, the continued fall in the Contract-Manufactured Products segment is concerning. Lower demand for COVID-related products is worrying from the business perspective. Contraction in gross margin does not bode well. The lowering of West Pharmaceutical’s full-year financial outlook also raises apprehensions.Estimates TrendWest Pharmaceutical has been witnessing a downward estimate revision trend for 2022. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has declined 0.4% to $9.09 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues stands at $2.97 billion, suggesting growth of 4.8% from the year-ago reported number.West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.

The company beat earnings estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met estimates in one and missed once, the average negative surprise being 0.48%.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCritical CareEdwards Lifesciences is likely to have gained from the continued demand for its state-of-the-art HemoSphere monitoring platform. As economies return to pre-pandemic levels, amid ongoing COVID-19 concerns, the increased hospital visits are likely to have benefited HemoSphere sales, thus adding to the top line. In the prior quarter, the company’s portfolio of Smart Recovery sensors and TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices supported the increased number of patients in the Intensive Care Unit. We believe this trend to have continued in the third quarter, benefiting the segment’s results.Our model shows a 4% year-over-year decline in Critical Care revenues in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $209 million, implying a decline of 1.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Surgical Structural HeartEdwards Lifesciences is likely to have gained from the increased penetration of the company’s premium RESILIA products. Edwards Lifesciences has seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the United States since its initial launch in April. Based on the commercial success of INSPIRIS, as well as the benefits of the innovative RESILIA tissue technology, Q3 revenues within this segment are expected to have been strong for Edwards Lifesciences.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEdwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteStory continuesHowever, sales headwinds from the planned discontinuation of certain noncore cannula products, as well as the COVID shutdown in China, combined with the ongoing staffing shortages in healthcare and inflationary pressure, are expected to have marred revenues significantly.Our model shows a 3.5% year-over-year decline in Surgical Structural Heart revenues in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $219 million, implying a decline of 0.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors at PlayWithin the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) arm, the company is likely to have witnessed continued growth in TAVR procedures across the United States and worldwide. Despite the ongoing industry-wide challenges like U.S. hospital staffing constraints and foreign exchange headwinds, the company is expected to have reported sales growth in this business based on focused R&amp;D. For full-year 2022, it expects R&amp;D expenses to be between 17% and 18% of sales as it develops new product pipeline and generates evidence to support TAVR and TMTT. This is likely to have boosted production and sales in Q3 within this business.Further, with the ongoing rebound in treatment rates, given the abating effects of the pandemic, the company is likely to have witnessed robust uptake of the SAPIEN platform, as it did in the previous quarter.The company’s Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies segment’s PASCAL platform is likely to have maintained strong growth momentum in Q3. This rally is expected to have been driven by the growing body of clinical evidence for PASCAL in the tricuspid position. Further, the company continues to make meaningful progress in enrolling its TRISCEND II pivotal trial for the EVOQUE system.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.34 billion, suggesting a rise of 2.1% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter 2022 net earnings of 62 cents indicates 14.8% growth from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

The company, in the last reported quarter, witnessed a greater uptake of clear aligners, especially among first-time customers. Analysts expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, aiding sales growth.Strong potential exists, particularly in the teen segment, with an increase in the number of doctors submitting teen cases in the past few months. Further, Invisalign First for kids has been gaining market share rapidly across all regions.

QuoteThe other latest Invisalign innovations for the Align Digital Platform, including the ClinCheck Live Update, the Invisalign Practice App, Invisalign Personalized Plan, Invisalign Smile Architect and the Cone Beam Computed Tomography integration feature for ClinCheck digital treatment planning software, too are likely to have fortified Invisalign utilization.As the economies around the world return to normalcy amid COVID-19 concerns, we anticipate Invisalign case volumes to have rebounded across the Americas and international regions. However, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the heightened volatility in foreign exchange rates might have posed hindrances to recovery, hampering business performance in Q3. Further, staffing shortages and the ongoing inflationary pressure are expected to have dragged the company’s profitability down in Q3.Story continuesOverall, our model shows a 2.6% year-over-year decline in total clear aligner revenues in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clear Aligner revenues is pegged at $803 million, suggesting a 4.2% drop from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services BusinessAlign Technology is expected to have gained from robust iTero scanner services revenues as it did in the previous quarter. The company has been witnessing continued growth in the iTero scanner installed base, with strong adoption of the iTero Element 5D Plus imaging system. This growing uptake of iTero scanners is likely to have sustained, benefiting the company’s top-line growth.The continued rise in intraoral digital scans used for Invisalign case submissions signals an enhanced digital adoption within dental offices. In Q2, the total worldwide intraoral digital scans submitted to start an Invisalign case increased to 88.4% on a year-over-year basis. We anticipate this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, advancing business performance.The company’s third-quarter results are likely to benefit from exocad CAD/CAM products and services revenues. These offerings, including restorative dentistry, implantology, guided surgery and smile design products, extend the Align Digital Platform toward fully integrated interdisciplinary end-to-end workflows.Our model projects a 2.7% year-over-year decline in total Imaging Systems &amp; CAD/CAM Services revenues in the third quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $181 million, indicating a 1.6% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $973.4 million, suggesting a decline of 4.2% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter 2022 EPS of $2.20 suggests a 23.3% fall from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

The annual inflation rate is 8.3% for the 12 months ended August 2022,according to the U.S. Labor Department data published on Sep 13, 2022.To counter the swelling inflation, the Federal Reserve has implemented five interest rate hikes so far this year to achieve a 2% inflation rate target. The Fed expects interest rates to reach 4.4% by this year-end, up from the current range of 3-3.25%.Rising interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will affect consumer spending. It will also cause a higher unemployment rate, thus slowing down economic growth. Notably, the United States recorded two successive quarters of downturn.Defensive Stocks: A Safe Haven Amid Economic TurmoilGiven the current market situation and the growing fears of an upcoming recession, investors are panicking to continue investing in the market. Does it mean that there are no sectors to invest in amid this market volatility?To stay safe and avail returns in this unpredictable market condition, investors can pump their resources into the defensive sectors like consumer staples, utilities and health care.Story continuesThese sectors comprise companies providing necessary products and services, which consumers will continue to access even during an unprecedented economic turmoil.Stocks catering to the defensive sectors are less likely to get affected by the economic turbulence and will thus remain a suitable choice for stable earnings.Defensive stocks also tend to offer high-dividend yields, and cater to capital preservation and income generation, thereby emerging as solid picks for investors to diversify their portfolio.Our Top Stock SuggestionsWe recommend four defensive stocks as these are less sensitive to take a hit from an economic downturn.

A ratio below 100% means the insurer earned more in premiums than it paid out in claims.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath)]"

Our focus is now on taking care of our customers and meeting our industry-leading objective of resolving 90% of our property claims arising out of catastrophes, including this historic storm, within 30 days.""Even in the face of challenging weather, we generated meaningful profit with core income for the quarter of $526 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, and core return on equity of 7.9%. These results benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.6 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year period, and a solid underlying combined ratio of 92.5%.

Retention remained very strong at 86%, and new business increased 9% from the prior year period.

In Personal Insurance, renewal premium change was meaningfully higher both year over year and sequentially, as we continue to address elevated industry-wide loss costs.""Our meaningful franchise value is reflected in our top- and bottom-line results for the quarter and year-to-date. Our terrific quarterly performance over the past two years builds on our excellent, decade-long track record of growing at industry-leading returns with industry-low volatility.

FOX News Digital remained the most engaged brand on social media in the competitive set for the quarter, with 46 million interactions on Meta Platform’s META Facebook, 46.3 million interactions on Instagram and 11.9 million interactions on Twitter.FOX News also placed first with YouTube video views among news brands for the 5th straight quarter (20th consecutive month), garnering over 848 million video views.Fox News has been the driving engine for Fox Corporation as it usually attracts more prime-time audiences than its rivals and is competitive with the more widely distributed broadcast networks as well.What is Aiding Growth at Fox?The Fox News Channel (“FNC”) has been benefiting from Fox Nation as it increased FNC’s subscriber base by approximately 80% in fiscal 2022. The conversion rate of trialists to paid subscribers has been high and retention rates were above industry averages.The Cable Network Programming segment, which generates 44% of Fox’s revenues, witnessed 7% year-over-year growth as affiliate and advertising fees increased.The increase in advertising revenues was primarily due to higher pricing at FOX News Media and an increase in the number of live events at the national sports networks.Fox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation Price and ConsensusFox Corporation price-consensus-chart | Fox Corporation QuoteFox’s growing user base is not only driven by Fox News but also by Fox Business, which drove 151 million multiplatform views as of August.

This does not bode well for Fox.The company also faces competition for ad dollars, which forms its main source of revenue. This is intensified by offerings from tech giants like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Amazon, as they too have been fighting for ad dollars. Meta benefits from increasing mobile ad revenues and growing adoption of stories by advertisers across Instagram.The recent news of Fox being merged with News Corporation NWSA has also not been well accepted by investors as the latter faces headwinds from the print-advertising model getting redundant. A major portion of News Corporation’s total revenues, which are generated outside the United States, can hurt the company’s top and bottom lines due to the ongoing foreign exchange fluctuation or the U.S. dollar gaining strength.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs are also denting the prospects of transport service providers.However, despite this gloom, there are some positives like impressive freight demand as economic activities gain pace following the easing of COVID-related restrictions. Stocks like Expeditors International of Washington EXPD, C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW and Matson MATX are well-positioned to capitalize on this healthy demand environment.About the IndustryThe companies housed in the Zacks Transportation-Services industry offer transporters logistics, leasing and maintenance services. Some industry players focus on the business of global logistics management, including international freight forwarding. Third-party logistics entities provide innovative supply-chain solutions. They also focus on services like product sourcing, warehousing and freight shipping. The companies have expertise in trucking, air and ocean transportation. Additionally, some players in this industry deliver domestic and international express delivery services. The well-being of the companies in this industrial cohort is directly proportional to the health of the economy. An uptick in manufactured and retail goods, favorable pricing and improvement in global economic conditions bode well for the industry participants.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Transportation-Services IndustryFreight Demand Remains Impressive: Owing to the gradual recovery in economic activities, freight demand continues to be strong despite minor hiccups. This is supporting growth of the transport service providers. The Cass Freight shipments Index improved 4.8% year over year in September. The overall improving trend is evident from the fact that the measure has improved year over year in five (February, March, July, August and September) of the nine months reported so far this year.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainties a Woe:  To tame the sky-high inflation in the United States, the Fed adopted a hawkish stance. Per the latest available data, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2022 was up 8.2% year over year. As a result of the higher-than-expected reading, the Fed, which has already raised its core interest rate 3% year-to-date, is likely to retain its interest-raising policy in its future meetings this year.  Higher interest rates result in the cost of borrowing moving north. This escalates the chances of an economic slowdown. Risks associated with economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes are hurting the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort.High Costs Hurting the Bottom Line:Operating expenses are on the rise, mainly due to increased fuel costs. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any transportation player. High oil price (up 48% in first-half 2022) is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Transportation - Services industry is a 28-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation  sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #187, which places it in the bottom 25% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates dismal near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Mar 31, 2022, the industry's earnings estimates for 2022 have decreased 6.3%.Before we present a few stocks from the industry that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and the valuation pictureIndustry Lags S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Zacks Transportation-Services industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 27.8% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 21.8% and the broader sector’s plunge of 21.9%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationBased on the forward 12-month price-to-sales, a commonly used multiple for valuing the Transportation-services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 1.41X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.06X.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings and revenues is pegged at $1.91 per share and $41.83 billion, respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors’ third-quarter earnings per share has been revised downward by 13 cents over the past 30 days. The bottom-line projection, however, indicates a year-over-year decline of 25.6%. The top-line estimate implies year-over-year growth of 56.2%.In the last reported quarter, GM missed earnings estimates on better-than-expected revenues from North America, International and Financial segments. Over the trailing four quarters, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed once, with the average surprise being 18.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:General Motors Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Motors Company Price and EPS SurpriseGeneral Motors Company price-eps-surprise | General Motors Company QuoteA Peek into Q3 PredictionsGeneral Motors was the top-selling carmaker in the United States in the third quarter of 2022.GM’s total third-quarter U.S. sales increased 24.3% year over year to 555,580 vehicles. While Buick deliveries skid 27.4% year over year, sales of the other three brands — Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac — posted double-digit year-over-year percentage gains. Sales of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac jumped 29.5%, 23.9% and 49.5% respectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMNA segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 777,000 units, implying an increase from 423,000 units in the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate for wholesale shipments from the GMNA segment is 734,000 units for the to-be-reported quarter. Thanks to higher unit sales and rising vehicle prices, we project General Motors’ revenues from the GMNA unit to jump 58.3% year over year. The consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $34,397 million, implying a rise from $20,554 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for operating profit from the segment is pegged at $3,834 million, indicating an increase of 80.4% year over year. Our estimate for the same is $3,268 million.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s GMI segment’s wholesale vehicle sales is pegged at 234,000 units, implying an increase from 113,000 units in the third quarter of 2021. Our estimate for wholesale shipments from the GMI segment is 199,000 units for the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s revenues is $5,387 million, indicating a rise from $2,843 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. We project revenues of $5,481 million from the GMI unit. The consensus mark for the operating profit from the segment is pegged at $162 million, indicating a decline from $229 million. We expect profits from the segment to inch up 1.4% year over year.As for the GM Financial unit, the company’s gloomy 2022 outlook for the segment raises concern. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the GM Financial unit is pegged at $3,304 million, down from $3,354 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021. We anticipate the profits from the segment to contract more than 7% year over year. The consensus mark for GM Financial’s operating profit is $968 million, down from $1,093 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.The consensus mark for the GM Cruise unit’s operating loss stands at $432 million, widening from $286 million incurred in the year-ago period. We project the unit to post an operating loss of around $247 million.While higher-year-over-year shipments and revenues from GMNA and GMI segments bode well, weak forecasts from GM Financial and GM Cruise dim the overall third-quarter view. It is also to be noted that high commodity costs, including platinum group metals and steel prices, are likely to have played spoilsports. General Motors expects headwinds from commodity inflation and logistical challenges to be around more than $5 billion higher from 2021 levels as well as the prior projection. This further softens the outlook for the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for General Motors this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case hereEarnings ESP: It has an Earnings ESP of -13.99%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.64 per share is pegged 27 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for new vehicle retail revenues for the third quarter is pegged at $3,480 million, indicating a rise from $2,898 million reported in the year-ago period. Our estimate for the quarter is $3,388.2 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for used vehicle retail revenues for the third quarter stands at $2,471 million, indicating a rise from $2,080 million. Our estimate for the quarter is $2,528.3 million.Although Lithia is benefiting from rising prices of vehicles, which is set to aid third-quarter revenues, increasing cost of goods sold is likely to have weighed on the firm’s margins. The consensus mark for third-quarter 2022 gross margins in the new vehicle retail segment is pegged at 11.44%, indicating a fall from 12.1% recorded in the corresponding period of 2021. The consensus mark for gross margin in the used vehicle retail segment is 9.33%, implying a contraction from 11.2% recorded in the year-ago period.Lithia’s intensive expansion plans augur well for long-term growth, but these have likely capped the firm’s financials.

However, this shouldn’t surprise TipRanks’ users who leverage our website traffic screener. TipRanks’ website traffic screener showed that Netflix’s web visits are rising, indicating higher user engagement that could translate into subscriber growth in Q3.Per the tool, the web visits to netflix.com were up 6.63% quarter-over-quarter in Q3. Given the rise in traffic, Netflix announced that it had higher engagement than its peers and accounted for more TV time.According to the company, Netflix accounts for 7.6% of TV time in the US, roughly 2.6 times more than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and 1.4 times higher than Disney+. Further, NFLX accounts for 8.2% of video viewing in the U.K., about 2.3 times higher than Amazon and 2.7 times more than Disney+.Thanks to the higher engagement, Netflix added 2.41 million paid subscribers in Q3, much higher than its guidance of 1 million. What stands out is its stellar performance in the APAC (Asia Pacific) region. Netflix added 1.43 million paid subscribers in Q3, outperforming other regions by a wide margin.It’s worth highlighting that for Netflix, our website traffic prediction has been correct for three consecutive quarters. In Q2, our website traffic screener correctly predicted that Netflix would lose subscribers, owing to which its revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates.While Netflix bounced back in Q3, let’s leverage TipRanks’ website traffic screener to gauge what’s on the horizon for Disney+ in the fourth quarter.Website Traffic Shows Rising Trends for Disney+ For Disney+, a leading subscription-based streaming service from Disney (NYSE:DIS), the tool shows that web visits are rising, pointing to a continued improvement in demand. The data shows that traffic at disneyplus.com increased 10.91% quarter-over-quarter in Q4.Notably, Disney+ added 14.4 million subscribers during the last reported quarter.Story continuesThe web visit trends show that Disney could continue to add more subscribers in Q4.

Thus, our web traffic screener comes in handy to gain insights about what will happen ahead of the earnings report.Meanwhile, on TipRanks, Netflix stock has a Hold consensus estimate based on 10 buy, 14 Hold, and five sell recommendations. An adverse currency movement and higher content and marketing spending could weigh on its revenues and operating margins in the near term.On the contrary, Disney stock has received 14 Buy and three Hold recommendations for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The rising web traffic trends indicate that Disney’s revenues could zoom past estimates in the upcoming fourth quarter.Disclosure]"

These companies tend to have long track records of success and many of them pay out generous dividends that supply investors with a stable source of passive income, making them popular additions to the portfolios of dividend investors.These companies also tend to excel during economic downturns like the one we’re in the midst of now, given that many of them are mature value stocks whose products and services are household staples that can’t be cut from even the tightest of budgets.Just as portfolio diversification can insulate investors from the risk of specific sectors or stocks taking big hits, so too can investing in well diversified companies help insulate investors from the risk that those specific stocks will experience big swings in value one way or the other. Given the level of uncertainty on the market right now, it’s no wonder investors are increasingly turning to diversified stocks to get them through the lean times to come.While even value stocks have struggled in 2022, being down by 13.4% year-to-date according to Morningstar data, they’ve nonetheless outperformed the broader market and thrashed growth stocks, which are down by 36.8% this year. When the market begins to turn the corner, they’ll likewise be the quickest to regain their earlier losses, giving good short- and long-term potential.With that in mind, we checked out the portfolios of some of the best value investors in the world to see which diversified stocks they’re betting on as the economy heads towards a recession and compiled their top picks in this article.Story continuesPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyThe following diversified stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.The 10 Most Diversified Stocks That Hedge Funds Love10. Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 44 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the most popular diversified stocks among hedge funds. Just making the list in tenth is Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON), which services the home building and aviation industries, in addition to providing software, automation, and productivity solutions for a the mining, life sciences, oil and gas, and pulp and paper industries, among others.Honeywell’s backlog is up and the company topped earnings expectations in the second quarter, so it’s performing well despite shares being off by 17% this year. The company expects to grow its organic sales by between 5% and 7% this year. Honeywell has more than doubled its dividend payments over the past decade, and the stock currently yields a solid 2.47%.Hedge fund ownership of Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) dipped by 14% during Q2 and 33% lower than its all-time highs reached during 2018 and 2019. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital and D E Shaw each own more than 1 million shares of HON as of June 30.Distillate Capital sold out of its Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) position last year, noting in its Q3 2021 investor letter that it preferred the value proposition offered by other stocks:“The largest exited positions were Oracle, which outperformed significantly, and Texas Instruments and Honeywell, which were roughly flat versus the market in the quarter but were edged out for inclusion by other stocks that became even more attractively valued.”9. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 51 General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has a wide range of segments, including a financial services division, a transportation segment that services the drilling, railroad, and marine industries, among others, as well as segments devoted to aviation, renewable energy, healthcare, oil and gas, and power. GE is set to spin off its healthcare segment in January 2023.General Electric’s orders were up 8% in the first half of the year, including 29% in the aviation segment, but supply chain issues have weighed heavily on its ability to fulfill those orders, which has put the company’s 2022 guidance in jeopardy. GE now expects that $1 billion in projected 2022 free cash flow will be pushed out to 2023, and it may still miss its reduced 2022 FCF projections. GE pays out an $0.08 quarterly dividend which gives shares an annual yield of 0.50%.Smart money ownership of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) peaked during the first quarter of 2021 but has fallen by 30% since, having declined for four of the past five quarters. Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners and Edward Eisler’s Eisler Capital sold out of their GE positions during Q2.Longleaf Partners is bullish on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)’s improved balance sheet as well as the growth potential for its primary businesses, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 55 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) operates five segments that serve a wide range of industries. Those segments are Healthcare, Industrial, Consumer, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy. 3M has over 100 manufacturing facilities spread across more than 35 countries worldwide. Some of its most well-known consumer products include Scotch tape and Post-it notes.One of many dividend kings that rank highly on the list of most diversified stocks, 3M pays out an annual dividend of $5.94 per share, which currently yields a hefty 5.39%. The stock currently sits at a nine-year low in part due to legal challenges that could see the company hit with billons in losses. If 3M can survive that hurdle, expect the stock to take off.There’s been a 31% surge this year in the number of funds long 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), pushing smart money ownership of the stock near its all-time highs. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns nearly 6.2 million MMM shares worth $802 million as of June 30, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital raised its stake in 3M by 18% during Q2 to 921,930 shares.Mayar Capital bought back into 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) this year, explaining its decision to do so in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.""7. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 While Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is best known for its eponymous oral health and soap brands, the company also sells a wide range of other products, including deodorant, shampoo, fabric softeners, and pet food.Colgate-Palmolive grew organic sales by 9% during Q2, thanks in part to inflation driving the average price of its products up by 8.5%. Inflation negatively impacted the company’s bottom line however, as adjusted earnings fell by 10% year-over-year. The dividend king also raised its dividend payments by 4.4% during Q2, giving its shares a yield of 2.68%.The number of hedge fund shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) topped 60 for the first time in the middle of 2021 and inched up by 12% during Q2 of this year. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies has been a CL shareholder for several years and owns over 4.87 million shares worth $390 million as of June 30.First Eagle Investments Global Fund, which had the largest position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database as of June 30, shared some of the reasons why it likes the stock in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of consumer staples giant Colgate-Palmolive have performed well as investors rotated into more recessionary-resilient defensive stocks amid the broader selloff during the second quarter. The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces. We continue to like Colgate- Palmolive’s dividend and previously announced $5 billion stock buyback program.”6. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 While The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is primarily a beverage giant, it does have a diverse collection of products, including its eponymous soda, as well as Minute Maid, Powerade, Fanta, Sprite, and Dasani, among others. Coca-Cola is also expanding into flavored alcoholic beverages. In certain regions, Coca-Cola also produces and/or distributes several brands that aren’t owned by the company, including Monster Energy, Nestea, and some of Dr. Pepper Snapple’s brands.Coca-Cola grew organic sales by 16% during Q2, while earnings rose by 4% in a challenging environment. The company expects to generate $10.5 billion in free cash flow, with some of that windfall finding its way back to investors in the form of dividend payments, which currently yield 3.14%. The company is also closing in on 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend payments.Hedge fund ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) hit a multi-year high at the end of 2021, but has dipped by 15% this year. Investing legend Warren Buffett remains KO’s staunchest supporter, owning an even 400 million shares worth over $25 billion as of June 30. Buffett has owned a stake in the company since 1988.The ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy bought more shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and other defensive stocks heading into a turbulent 2022, as outlined in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (Coca-Cola). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the favorite diversified companies among hedge funds.

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now.United States President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that the US economy will avoid a recession despite rising interest rates and soaring inflation, a lethal economic combo, and even predicted that it will resume growth in the coming months. Economic experts do not share his point of view. A recent report by news platform Bloomberg reveals that a recession is effectively certain in the next 12 months. The prediction, based on a new Bloomberg Economics model, forecasts a higher recession probability across all timeframes. Per the model, the 12-month estimate of a downturn by October 2023 has hit 100%, up from 65% in the previous update. Analysts Anna Wong and Eliza Winger are leading authors of the new report. The model made by the analysts uses a total of 13 macroeconomic and financial indicators to predict the chance of a downturn at horizons of one month to two years. According to the model, the likelihood of a recession within 11 months has climbed to 73% from 30%, and the 10-month probability has risen to 25% from 0%, in the past few months. Investors can take advantage of the selloff at the stock market due to these economic conditions, which has led to a broad decrease in the share prices of solid businesses like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), to reap the rewards later. These firms also have resilient dividend yields and a dependable history of payouts that provide an extra layer of protection against volatile market conditions. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the Fortune 500 list and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues12 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy NowImage by Steve Buissinne from PixabayBest Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now12.

Here is what the fund said:”In late August, we increased the portfolio’s cyclical exposure by trimming utilities after a period of relative outperformance and reallocating the capital to midstream energy, which had pulled back over the summer. We added ONEOK Inc. (OKE) with the expectation that it will benefit from increasing natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery in the Bakken region.”11. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40     Dividend Yield as of October 18: 5.43%International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated technology solutions and services worldwide.

The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

(NASDAQ:WBA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We first invested in Walgreens Boots Alliance in early 2013. Over our holding period, Walgreens merged with U.K.-based Boots Alliance, establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain. CEO Stefano Pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships (as opposed to vertical integration deals) to increase store traffic and to, over time, transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy. Using its strong FREE cash flow generation, the company ramped up its investments in technology, aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information. Mr. Pessina was not successful, however, at turning around the firm’s U.S. retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures. He stepped down as CEO in 2020, and in 2021, Roz Brewer took the reins of the firm. We admire Ms. Brewer’s impressive track record at companies that include Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Walmart (Sam’s Club). However, given management’s decision to divest core cash-generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups, we prefer to step aside while we follow the company’s progress.”9.

We expect revenue growth to kick back in towards the end of 2022, and the huge FCF coupon helped offset value decline from the weaker guidance. The other factor weighing on the stock price was largest shareholder Temasek’s partial sale of its 10% position in the quarter, creating uncertainty and a share price overhang. We have a 13D filed and continue to urge the company to take steps to address the significant price-to-value gap, including continued share buybacks.”7. Altria Group, Inc.

We expect MO to generate close to $5 in annual FCF per share over the next few years, putting the stock at ~ 10x, which is less than half the market’s multiple today. Over the last decade, shares have traded at an average multiple of 15x and within a range of ~ 10x – 20x (+/-1 standard deviation). The stock yields 7.2% at the current price, close to a 6% premium to treasuries. Historically, shares have traded closer to a 3% premium to the 10Y, which would imply a ~ $75 share price.”6.

(NYSE:LOW) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW)’s is a high-quality business with significant long-term earnings growth potential underpinned by a superb management team that is successfully executing a multi-faceted business transformation.COVID-19 was a transformational event for the US housing market, causing homeowners to invest significantly in their homes as they shifted nearly all their daily activities to the home environment, including work, school, and leisure. The increased use of the home during COVID, in turn, increased the need for repair, maintenance and remodel activity, which significantly benefited Lowe’s same-store sales. As consumers return to spending more time and money on out-of-the home activities the near-term demand for certain Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) categories has decreased. Moderation in DIY demand combined with increased mortgage rates and decreased housing affordability has caused many market participants to become concerned that the home improvement industry may give up a significant part of their COVID pandemic sales gains.While we expect that there will be some near-term volatility and continued moderation of DIY demand, growth remains strong for projects requiring professional installation (the “Pro” business) due to a substantial backlog of projects undertaken during COVID, which should support industry growth in the near-term. In addition, we believe the medium[1]term growth outlook for the home improvement industry remains strong as demand is likely to normalize at a materially higher level as compared to the pre-COVID era. For the decade prior to COVID, home improvement industry sales were notably depressed relative to their long-term averages as a percentage of overall consumer spend and GDP and have only now returned to their longer-term historical levels. Moreover, we believe COVID has permanently renewed consumers’ focus, appreciation, and utilization of their homes, which combined with higher home equity values, strong consumer balance sheets, low levels of home inventory for sale and an aging housing stock that requires an increasing level of maintenance, will likely result in a structurally higher level of ongoing home industry spending in the future. In the most recent quarter demand strengthened throughout the quarter as DIY consumers returned from summer vacations and focused on less seasonal home improvement projects…” (Click here to read the full text)Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Fortune 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:10 Best Home Builder Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Japanese Stocks to Invest in 202210 Best Long-Term Growth Stocks To Invest In Disclosure.

363,14137064-4d11-3f1e-aa14-5ca6564f4b9b,MTB,2022-10-19,M&T BANK CORPORATION ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-t-bank-corporation-announces-101100692.html,1666174260,STORY,"['MTB', 'MTB-PH']","[BUFFALO, N.Y., Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- M&amp;T Bank Corporation (""M&amp;T"") (NYSE: MTB) today reported its results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2022.GAAP Results of Operations. Diluted earnings per common share measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") were $3.53 in the third quarter of 2022, compared with $3.69 in the year-earlier quarter and $1.08 in the second quarter of 2022. GAAP-basis net income was $647 million in the recent quarter, $495 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $218 million in the second 2022 quarter. GAAP-basis net income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets was 1.28% in each of the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, and .42% in the second quarter of 2022. That net income produced a return on average common shareholders' equity of 10.43% in the recent quarter, 12.16% in the similar 2021 period and 3.21% in the second quarter of 2022. The results reflect non-operating merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of People's United Financial, Inc. (""People's United"") of $53 million ($39 million after-tax effect, or $0.22 of diluted earnings per common share) in the recent quarter, compared with $9 million ($7 million after-tax effect, or $.05 of diluted earnings per common share) in the year-earlier quarter and $465 million ($346 million after-tax effect, or $1.94 of diluted earnings per share) in the second quarter of 2022.Darren J. King, Chief Financial Officer, commenting on M&amp;T's results noted, ""We are pleased with the recent quarter gains in net operating income which are up 21% from the second quarter and 39% year over year. That improvement reflects increases in taxable-equivalent net interest income of 19% and 74%, coupled with low credit losses and well-controlled expenses. We are excited to continue our integration work to build a preeminent commercial bank across the eastern United States and we are committed to the success of the consumers, small businesses and communities across our expanded footprint.""Story continuesEarnings HighlightsChange 3Q22 vs.($ in millions, except per share data)3Q223Q212Q223Q212Q22Net income$647$495$21831%197%Net income available to common shareholders ̶ diluted$621$476$19230%223%Diluted earnings per common share$3.53$3.69$1.08-4%227%Annualized return on average assets1.28%1.28%.42%Annualized return on average common equity10.43%12.16%3.21%For the first nine months of 2022, diluted earnings per common share were $7.14, compared with $10.43 in the year-earlier period. GAAP-basis net income was $1.23 billion and $1.40 billion in the first three quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average assets and average common shareholders' equity, GAAP-basis net income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 was .87% and 7.24%, respectively, compared with 1.24% and 11.76%, respectively, in the similar 2021 period.Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations. M&amp;T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a ""net operating"" or ""tangible"" basis, from which M&amp;T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill and core deposit and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into M&amp;T (when incurred), since such items are considered by management to be ""nonoperating"" in nature. The amounts of such ""nonoperating"" expenses are presented in the tables that accompany this release.Merger-related expenses generally consist of professional services and other temporary help fees associated with actual or planned conversions of systems and/or integration of operations, costs related to terminations of existing contractual arrangements to purchase various services, severance and travel costs. Reflected in merger-related expenses in the second quarter of 2022 was a provision for credit losses of $242 million. GAAP requires that acquired loans be recorded at estimated fair value, which includes the use of interest rate and expected credit loss assumptions to forecast estimated cash flows. GAAP also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired, but not classified as purchased credit deteriorated (""PCD"") also be recognized. Accordingly, M&amp;T recorded a $242 million provision related to such loans obtained in the People's United acquisition. Given the requirement to recognize such losses above and beyond the impact of forecasted losses used in determining the fair value of acquired loans, M&amp;T considers that provision to be a merger-related expense. Although ""net operating income"" as defined by M&amp;T is not a GAAP measure, M&amp;T's management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.83 in the third quarter of 2022, compared with $3.76 in the year-earlier quarter and $3.10 in the second quarter of 2022. Net operating income aggregated $700 million in the recent quarter, $504 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $578 million in 2022's second quarter. Expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity, net operating income in the third quarter of 2022 was 1.44% and 17.89%, respectively, 1.34% and 17.54%, respectively, in the similar quarter of 2021 and 1.16% and 14.41%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2022.Diluted net operating earnings per common share in the first nine months of 2022 totaled $9.78, compared with $10.61 in the similar 2021 period. Net operating income during the first nine months of 2022 was $1.65 billion, up from $1.42 billion in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021. Net operating income expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.23% and 15.13%, respectively, in the initial nine months of 2022, compared with 1.30% and 17.10%, respectively, in the similar 2021 period.Taxable-equivalent Net Interest Income. Taxable-equivalent net interest income totaled $1.69 billion in the recent quarter, up from $971 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.42 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The increase compared with the earlier quarters reflects a higher net interest margin and, additionally, when compared with the year-earlier quarter, the impact of earning assets obtained in the acquisition of People's United. Average earning assets totaled $182.4 billion in the recent quarter, compared with $140.4 billion in the third quarter of 2021 and $189.8 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Average loans outstanding were $127.5 billion in the third quarter of 2022, compared with $95.3 billion in the year earlier quarter and $127.6 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The higher average balances of both earnings assets and loans outstanding in the second and third quarters of 2022 compared with the third quarter of 2021 reflect the impact of additional earning assets obtained in the acquisition of People's United. Reflecting the impact of rising interest rates, the net interest margin increased to 3.68% in the third quarter of 2022, up from 2.74% in the corresponding quarter of 2021 and 3.01% in the second quarter of 2022.Taxable-equivalent Net Interest IncomeChange 3Q22 vs.($ in millions)3Q223Q212Q223Q212Q22Average earning assets$182,382$140,420$189,75530%-4%Net interest income ̶ taxable-equivalent$1,691$971$1,42274%19%Net interest margin3.68%2.74%3.01%Provision for Credit Losses/Asset Quality. The provision for credit losses was $115 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $302 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared with a $20 million recapture of provision in the third quarter of 2021. Included in the second quarter of 2022 was a $242 million provision, recorded in accordance with GAAP, related to loans obtained in the People's United acquisition that were considered non-PCD. GAAP provides that an allowance for credit losses on such loans be recorded beyond the recognition of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date. In addition to that merger-related provision, M&amp;T recorded a provision for credit losses of $60 million in the second quarter of 2022. Net loan charge-offs were $63 million in the third quarter of 2022, $40 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $50 million in 2022's second quarter. Expressed as an annualized percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were .20% and .17% in the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively, and .16% in the second quarter of 2022.Loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $2.43 billion at September 30, 2022, compared with $2.24 billion at September 30, 2021 and $2.63 billion at June 30, 2022. The balance of nonaccrual loans at the end of the two most recent quarters as compared with September 30, 2021 reflects loans obtained in the acquisition of People's United. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans were 1.89% at September 30, 2022, improved from 2.40% a year earlier and 2.05% at June 30, 2022. Assets taken in foreclosure of defaulted loans were $37 million at September 30, 2022, $25 million a year earlier and $29 million at June 30, 2022.Allowance for Credit Losses. M&amp;T regularly performs comprehensive analyses of its loan portfolios and assesses forecasted economic conditions for purposes of determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. As a result of those procedures, the allowance for credit losses totaled $1.88 billion or 1.46% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2022 compared with $1.52 billion or 1.62% of loans outstanding at September 30, 2021 and $1.82 billion or 1.42% at June 30, 2022. The acquisition of People's United loans and leases resulted in a $341 million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of April 1, 2022, including $99 million related to PCD loans and $242 million related to non-PCD loans. Including the impact of the acquisition, M&amp;T's allowance for credit losses was $1.81 billion on April 1, 2022, or 1.42% of then outstanding loans. The higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of outstanding loans at the recent quarter end as compared with June 30, 2022 reflects a modestly less optimistic macroeconomic forecast.Asset Quality MetricsChange 3Q22 vs.($ in millions)3Q223Q212Q223Q212Q22At end of quarterNonaccrual loans$2,429$2,242$2,6338%-8%Real estate and other foreclosed assets$37$25$2949%29%Total nonperforming assets$2,466$2,267$2,6629%-7%Accruing loans past due 90 days or more (1)$477$1,026$524-54%-9%Nonaccrual loans as % of loans outstanding1.89%2.40%2.05%Allowance for credit losses$1,876$1,515$1,82424%3%Allowance for credit losses as % of loans outstanding1.46%1.62%1.42%For the periodProvision for credit losses$115$(20)$302—-62%Net charge-offs (2)$63$40$5058%27%Net charge-offs as % of average loans (annualized) (2).20%.17%.16%(1)Predominantly government-guaranteed residential real estate loans.(2)For the quarter-ended June 30, 2022, net charge-offs and related data do not reflect $33 million of charge-offs related to PCD acquired loans.Noninterest Income and Expense. Noninterest income totaled $563 million in the third quarter of 2022, compared with $569 million in the year-earlier quarter. Trust income, service charges on deposit accounts and credit-related fees included in other revenues from operations all increased reflecting the acquisition of People's United, but were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues resulting from M&amp;T's decision to retain recently originated mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell such loans. Noninterest income was $571 million in this year's second quarter. The comparative decline in the recent quarter was predominantly the result of lower service charges on deposit accounts and trust income, offset by higher credit-related fees.Noninterest IncomeChange 3Q22 vs.($ in millions)3Q223Q212Q223Q212Q22Mortgage banking revenues$83$160$83-48%—Service charges on deposit accounts1151051249%-7%Trust income18715719019%-2%Brokerage services income2120243%-13%Trading account and non-hedging derivative gains562-9%122%Gain (loss) on bank investment securities(1)————Other revenues from operations15312114827%4%Total$563$569$571-1%-1%Noninterest expense totaled $1.28 billion in the third quarter of 2022, compared with $899 million in the similar quarter of 2021 and $1.40 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature, such as amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and merger-related expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.21 billion in the recent quarter, $888 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $1.16 billion in 2022's second quarter. The most significant factor for the higher level of operating expenses in the recent quarter as compared with the year-earlier quarter was the impact of operations obtained in the People's United acquisition. Compared with the second quarter of 2022, the $46 million increase in operating expenses in 2022's third quarter predominantly resulted from a $32 million rise in salaries and benefits expenses attributable to an additional pay day in the third quarter and M&amp;T's continued investment in its talent base through salaries and incentive compensation.Noninterest ExpenseChange 3Q22 vs.($ in millions)3Q223Q212Q223Q212Q22Salaries and employee benefits$736$510$77644%-5%Equipment and net occupancy1278112557%2%Outside data processing and software95739431%1%FDIC assessments28192249%24%Advertising and marketing21152141%4%Printing, postage and supplies1581687%-5%Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets18318571%—Other costs of operations23919033125%-28%Total$1,279$899$1,40342%-9%]"

365,0c1d8e51-5922-3693-987a-0bbe1e6f2cbc,HP,2022-10-19,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Announces Supplemental Shareholder Return Plan and Capital Budget for Fiscal 2023 and Conference Call and Webcast for Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022",Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/helmerich-payne-inc-announces-supplemental-201500106.html,1666124100,STORY,['HP'],"[TULSA, Okla., October 18, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc. (""H&amp;P"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: HP) today announced its supplemental shareholder return plan and capital budget for fiscal year 2023. The Company also announced the timing of the upcoming conference call and webcast for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.President and CEO John Lindsay commented, ""I am pleased to announce the Company’s 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan, which augments our long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. Our current base dividend of $1/share per annum is meant to serve as a foundation of that cash return commitment throughout the cycles inherent in our industry. The supplemental dividend for fiscal 2023, which we anticipate will be approximately $100 million in aggregate, is meant to further boost shareholder returns. This plan, and any potential subsequent ones for future fiscal years, are not only designed to further enhance base cash returns, but also allow the Company the flexibility to further invest in the business, supplement additional dividend returns, and/or repurchase shares as those opportunities arise.""Implementation of this plan is also reflective of the Company’s ability to execute across multiple capital allocation strategies simultaneously. In North America Solutions, we plan to reactivate up to 16 rigs by March 31, 2023, for appropriate prices and terms. This would take our rig count from 176 as of September 30, 2022, to an upper target of 192 active rigs for fiscal 2023. H&amp;P’s continued efforts to expand its international presence and operations in fiscal 2023 is another such strategy. We realize some of the international capital investments H&amp;P makes this fiscal year, captured in our capex budget, will take time to fully develop and generate returns for the Company. However, we have previously stated that our international strategy, particularly with regards to the Middle East, is a long-term play, knowing that there will be upfront investments to secure our success.""Story continues2023 Supplemental Shareholder Return Plan:The Company has established its 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan, which is currently projected to provide approximately $100 million in additional cash returns to shareholders in the form of additional dividends. These supplemental dividends are expected to be paid in four, approximately equal, installments during fiscal 2023. These additional cash returns represent approximately 50% of the Company’s projected cash flow generation in fiscal 2023 after planned capital expenditures and after the Company’s already established ""base"" annual dividend of $1.00/share, which is roughly $110 million on an annualized basis. All such established base and supplemental dividends are subject to the determination and approval of the Company’s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.Under the plan, the Company may utilize remaining cash flow projected to be generated in fiscal year 2023, after planned capital expenditures, established base and supplemental dividends, as well as cash on hand, to fund additional supplemental dividends or opportunistically repurchase shares of its common stock under its evergreen four million shares per annum repurchase authorization. Such repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including market and industry conditions and other investment opportunities available to the Company.The 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan is specific to fiscal year 2023 and is derived from current forecasts and projections for fiscal year 2023, which are subject to change based on industry factors and market conditions. The intention is to refresh the plan in subsequent fiscal years with adjustments made based on relevant factors and market conditions at that time, including the Company’s projected cash flow generation, and accretive investment opportunities.On October 17, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash supplemental dividend of $0.235 per share, payable on December 1, 2022, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2022. The payable date and record date of this supplemental dividend coincide with the dates applicable to the Company’s base dividend of $0.25 per share, which was declared on September 7, 2022.Capex for Fiscal Year 2023:The Company has set its initial fiscal year 2023 capex budget to range between $425 and $475 million, representing a sizeable sequential increase and highlighting the capital-intensive nature of H&amp;P’s business as well as planned international expansion. H&amp;P’s North America Solutions segment accounts for approximately two-thirds of the expected spend as the Company plans to reactivate up to 16 idle rigs from its super-spec FlexRig® fleet, of which six rigs will be converted to a walking configuration and as maintenance capex per rig is expected to modestly exceed the high-end of the historic normalized range. The Company’s International Solutions segment accounts for roughly a quarter of the planned expenditures in anticipation of reactivating more rigs during the fiscal year, upgrading five rigs in Argentina to super-spec and converting six additional super-spec rigs domiciled in the U.S. to walking configurations that are currently planned to be exported to international operations later in the fiscal year. The remainder of the fiscal 2023 capex budget is slated for corporate and information technology purposes as the Company continues to invest in and modernize its own operational and business-driven technologies.Senior Vice President and CFO Mark Smith also commented, ""The Company has consistently maintained its strong financial position and is able to capitalize on that position to the benefit of its shareholders. H&amp;P is well-positioned to execute on its capital allocation plans for fiscal 2023, which cumulatively represent over $650 million - $425 million to $475 million in capex plus approximately $210 million of expected cash returns to shareholders. Furthermore, based on current expectations, we look to have additional cash generation beyond our planned capital commitments which can be used for opportunistic share repurchases, additional supplemental dividends or other investment opportunities.""Our North America Solutions segment’s fiscal 2023 capital expenditures budget is adversely impacted by higher maintenance capex, which looks to modestly exceed the historic range of $750 thousand to $1 million per rig per year. The fiscal 2023 range is expected to be between $1.1 million and $1.3 million per active rig. The reasons for this are twofold – one is due to the reduced spending during the pandemic years in which time the Company judiciously preserved capital spending by utilizing component equipment from idle rigs - we now must make up for those capital spending deferments, and two is due to the current inflationary environment and supply chain challenges that the industry is experiencing. Capital expenditures for our International Solutions segment are much more meaningful in fiscal 2023 as we anticipate converting some super-spec rigs in the U.S. to walking configurations that are earmarked for export and upgrading some international rigs to super-spec. Both of these planned spends are indicative of international markets escalating their focus on unconventional drilling.""To re-iterate, the supplemental shareholder return plan represents our current intention of returning capital to shareholders during fiscal 2023 based upon our outlook of market and industry conditions at present, including our current expectations surrounding rig pricing, activity levels, margins, cash generation, capital expenditures and other investments opportunities. In determining whether to proceed with the 2023 supplemental shareholder return plan as originally intended and any future supplemental shareholder return plans in later fiscal years, management and our board of directors will continue to review the Company’s financial position and performance together with relative market conditions at that time.""Our focus on a complete fiscal year multi-pronged capital allocation plan is in part a result of our customers’ and the upstream energy industry’s adhering to their annual budgets, which underpins confidence in our annual planning horizon. We believe the announced supplemental shareholder return plan will boost our already competitive yield. Additionally, the plan provides flexibility to allow for share repurchases or other investment opportunities, which remain prominent options to the deployment of capital.""John Lindsay concluded, ""These planned actions of enhancing shareholder cash returns and investing in future growth of the Company would not be possible without our strong capital stewardship and financial discipline.

Such information is routinely posted and accessible on its investor relations website at www.helmerichpayne.com. Information on our website is not part of this release.(1) Direct margin, which is considered a non-GAAP metric, is defined as operating revenues less direct operating expenses and is included as a supplemental disclosure. We believe it is useful in assessing and understanding our current operational performance, especially in making comparisons over time. Expected direct margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 is provided on a non-GAAP basis only because certain information necessary to calculate the most comparable GAAP measure is unavailable due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and the financial statement impact of certain items based on preliminary results. Therefore, as a result of the uncertainty and variability of the nature and amount of adjustments, which could be significant, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of expected direct margin to the most comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable effort.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221018006160/en/ContactsDave Wilson, investor.relations@hpinc.com, 918-588-5190]"

Analysts, on average, expected 65 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if reported numbers were comparable to estimates.Net revenue in the quarter climbed 6% to $890 million.In line with other major financial firms, Nasdaq has also battled rising costs amid decades-high inflation. Adjusted operating expenses in the September-quarter rose 5%.The company said it repurchased $633 million in shares of its common stock in the first nine months of the year.(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bengaluru and John McCrank in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)]"

The new corporate structure announced last month is designed to further advance our strategy, enhance our client focus and better position the organization to capture the dynamic opportunities inherent in our growth pillars.”Ann Dennison, Executive Vice President and CFO, said, “Our third quarter results reflect the carefully calibrated investments in our largest growth opportunities. With our deep client relationships and our resilient business model, we expect to continue to respond effectively to a wide range of operating environments. We have also positioned the balance sheet to minimize the impact of rising rates and to maintain flexibility to support our growth strategy.”Story continuesFINANCIAL REVIEWThird quarter 2022 net revenues were $890 million, an increase of $52 million, or 6%, from $838 million in the prior year period. Net revenues reflected a $77 million, or 9%, positive impact from organic growth, including positive contributions from all segments, partially offset by a $22 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $3 million decrease from the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures.Solutions segments revenues were $584 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $43 million, or 8%. The increase reflects a $53 million, or 10%, positive impact from organic growth, and a $1 million increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a $11 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.Market Services net revenues were $305 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $13 million, or 4%. The increase reflects a $24 million, or 8%, positive impact from organic growth, partially offset by a $11 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.Third quarter 2022 GAAP operating expenses increased $10 million, or 2%, versus the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects higher compensation and benefits expense due to continued investment in our people, higher computer operations and data communications expense, partially offset by lower general, administrative and other expense due to lower capital markets activity and lower depreciation and amortization expense.Third quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses increased $20 million, or 5% versus the prior year period. The increase reflects a $40 million, or 10%, organic increase over the prior year period, partially offset by a $19 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of acquisition and divestitures. The organic increase primarily reflects higher compensation and benefits expense due to continued investment in our people, higher general, administrative and other expense reflecting increased travel, and higher computer operations and data communications expense, partially offset by lower marketing and advertising expense due to lower capital markets activity.The company repurchased $633 million in shares of its common stock during the first nine months of 2022. As of September 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.2022 EXPENSE AND TAX GUIDANCE UPDATE5The company is narrowing its 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1,700 to $1,720 million. Nasdaq expects its 2022 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%.STRATEGIC AND BUSINESS UPDATESNasdaq announces new corporate structure to amplify strategy. On September 28, 2022, Nasdaq announced that it is organizing its business units into three divisions: Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms, and Anti-Financial Crime. This new structure will align the company more closely to the foundational shifts that are driving the evolution of the global financial system and evolving client needs. The new structure will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 with the corresponding executive appointments taking effect on January 1, 2023. Nasdaq establishes new Digital Assets business to power the digital asset ecosystem. The planned launch underpins Nasdaq’s ambition to facilitate broader institutional participation in digital assets by providing trusted and institutional-grade solutions, focused on custody, liquidity and integrity. Nasdaq Digital Assets will initially develop an advanced custody solution. Additionally, Nasdaq has expanded its anti-financial crime technology with new coverage for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including a comprehensive suite of crypto-specific detection capabilities. Nasdaq’s annualized SaaS revenues in the third quarter of 2022 increased 13% year over year. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $699 million in the third quarter of 2022, representing 35% of total company ARR, up from 34% in the third quarter of 2021. The 13% year over year increase in annualized SaaS revenues primarily reflects strong growth in our Anti-Financial Crime and Analytics businesses. Corporate Platforms delivered year over year growth from both IR and ESG Services and Listing Services. IR &amp; ESG Services revenues in the third quarter of 2022 increased 13% reflecting higher adoption and stronger retention across the breadth of investor relations and ESG advisory offerings. Listing Services revenues in the third quarter of 2022 increased 6% to $105 million. Investment Intelligence continues to deliver strong revenue growth led by Analytics and Index. The Analytics business, led by eVestment, saw continued strong user adoption across both asset owners and asset managers as annualized SaaS revenues increased 10% to $218 million. In our Index business, revenues increased 5% year over year and the business experienced strong net inflows of $56 billion over the last 12 months, partially offsetting the impact of market depreciation. Additionally, the number of contracts traded on futures and other derivatives tracking Nasdaq indexes increased 53% year over year. Nasdaq led all exchanges in total multiply-listed options traded, and Trade Management Services set a quarterly record for revenues. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2022, Nasdaq led all exchanges during the period in total volume traded for multiply-listed equity options. In our Trade Management Business, revenues increased 10% in the third quarter of 2022 versus the prior year period due to increased demand for connectivity and infrastructure services.____________1 Represents revenues less transaction-based expenses.2 Constitutes revenues from Market Technology, Investment Intelligence and Corporate Platforms segments.3 Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.4 Refer to our reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP net income, diluted earnings per share, operating income and operating expenses, included in the attached schedules.5 U.S. GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.ABOUT NASDAQNasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a global technology company serving the capital markets and other industries.

Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period-over-period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenues, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release.Foreign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSInformation set forth in this communication contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Nasdaq cautions readers that any forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking information.

If you want to see some more of the top 10 stock exchanges, go directly to Top 5 Stock Exchanges in the World.Stock exchanges are exchanges where different financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and commodities are traded. For each trade, there is a buyer and a seller.Stock exchanges are at the heart of capitalism. By being listed on stock exchanges, companies can raise capital to grow. If companies successfully grow with the capital they raise, they can hire more people and create more jobs. The increase in the value of their stocks further increases the wealth of the owners, who if they live in the same country, could help increase demand in that country. Because they are so important for the economy, stock exchanges are heavily regulated.HistoryImage by Gerd Altmann from PixabayThe first stock exchange was founded in Amsterdam in 1611 and the first stock to ever be traded was the Dutch East India Company and for a while it was the only company with any meaningful trading activity.In the United States, the first stock exchange was the Philadelphia Stock Exchange which was founded in 1790. The stock exchange helped the U.S. financial sector develop and also helped the United States expand west. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange would later be surpassed by the New York Stock Exchange.In 1971, the NASDAQ was founded as an exchange that allowed the buying and selling of stocks via a network of computers rather than in-person like on the NYSE during that time.Given the growth of the U.S. and global economy, stock exchanges have since formed all across the world and the total market capitalization of listed companies on stock exchanges have grown substantially from the 1970's.2022 HeadwindsSource: Federal Reserve.Chairman Powell presents the Monetary Policy Report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Report here: www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/2018-07-mpr-summary...Story continuesStock exchanges have seen a lot of times of bullish sentiment and a lot of times of bearish sentiment. In times of bullish sentiment,  the market capitalization of listed companies can grow and it can be easier for stock exchanges to make money. In times of bearish sentiment, however, it can be a little bit more difficult.In terms of 2022, it seems like we're in a bear market given that the markets have fallen substantially from their highs.The Federal Reserve has raised rates five times this year and as a result, it's harder for some businesses to grow. With the sudden rate of the raises, there is also concern that a recession could occur in 2023. According to a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists, there is a 60% chance of a recession over the next 12 months. According to some models, the odds of a recession are even higher.Some also think the Federal Reserve could continue to raise interest rates.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of inflation in September, ""Our expectation has been we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply side healing. We haven’t. We have seen some supply side healing but inflation has not really come down.""Powell also commented on the interest rate hikes, ""No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be. That’s going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored and also if we get more labor supply.""The United StatesNew York Stock ExchangeImage: flickr.comIn terms of the stock exchanges in the United States, the NYSE and the NASDAQ are the two main ones.Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) owns the NYSE exchange as well as several other futures and energy exchanges. The company began in May 2000 as an OTC trading platform that expanded through M&amp;A to acquire future exchanges and clearing. In 2012, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) did a transformative deal to buy NYSE Euronext which owned the NYSE at the time. Given successful M&amp;A, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) has rallied substantially since it went public. Due to the stock market decline, shares of the stock are down around 31.5% year to date in 2022.ClearBridge Investments commented on Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) in its Q2 2022 investor letter earlier in the year,Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) operates global financial exchanges and clearing houses, which we believe is a resilient business at a good valuation. One of our key tactics in a potential recessionary environment is to focus on stocks where earnings and cash flow will hold up better than the market. ICE fits the bill as it benefits directly from volatility in financial markets, including in commodities where we are seeing major price swings. During the first half, ICE earnings estimates came up modestly, but its valuation multiple fell over 30%. Some of this weakness is due to ICE’s planned acquisition of Black Knight (BKI), which we think makes strategic sense. However, it is being done as Black Knight’s business is projected to slow as housing activity cools on higher mortgage rates, and the deal may also face regulatory scrutiny. Regardless, the recent weakness in the stock gave us a price below our estimate of long-term business value for a solid and resilient business and we acted accordingly.For the second quarter, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) reported EPS of $1.32 versus the consensus of $1.27. Revenue for the period was $2.41 billion versus the consensus of $1.8 billion. While those numbers are strong, Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE)'s results might face headwinds in the future given the macro headwinds. On 10/6 Alex Kramm of UBS cut his price target to $116 from $128 but kept a 'Buy' rating citing softer than expected trends in the energy business as well as lower pricing. Kramm sees a significant sequential decline in the company's mortgage tech segment.Of the 895 hedge funds in our database, 51 were long Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) at the end of the second quarter. Cantillon Capital Management owned almost 4 million shares of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) at the end of the second quarter.Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is a global tech company that serves the capital markets and other industries. In addition to owning the NASDAQ exchange, the company offers data, analytics, software and services. On 10/12, Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank lowerd his price target to $67 from $68 on the NASDAQ but nevertheless kept a 'Buy' rating. Bedell cited revised macro assumptions in his models, among other things.The Federal Reserve rate hikes could cause market volatility, and that some companies might not go public when markets are extremely volatile. In addition to its valuation multiple, Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ)'s revenue could be affected by the market volatility as well.30 hedge funds we track owned shares of Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) at the end of Q2 2022.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.89bUS$3.02bUS$3.21bUS$3.48bUS$3.65bUS$3.80bUS$3.93bUS$4.05bUS$4.16bUS$4.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 4.94%Est @ 4.06%Est @ 3.43%Est @ 3%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.48% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.7% US$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.8kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$27bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.7%– 2.0%) = US$116bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$116b÷ ( 1 + 5.7%)10= US$67bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$93b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$72.9, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

These companies tend to have long track records of success and many of them pay out generous dividends that supply investors with a stable source of passive income, making them popular additions to the portfolios of dividend investors.These companies also tend to excel during economic downturns like the one we’re in the midst of now, given that many of them are mature value stocks whose products and services are household staples that can’t be cut from even the tightest of budgets.Just as portfolio diversification can insulate investors from the risk of specific sectors or stocks taking big hits, so too can investing in well diversified companies help insulate investors from the risk that those specific stocks will experience big swings in value one way or the other. Given the level of uncertainty on the market right now, it’s no wonder investors are increasingly turning to diversified stocks to get them through the lean times to come.While even value stocks have struggled in 2022, being down by 13.4% year-to-date according to Morningstar data, they’ve nonetheless outperformed the broader market and thrashed growth stocks, which are down by 36.8% this year.

We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.The 10 Most Diversified Stocks That Hedge Funds Love10. Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 44 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the most popular diversified stocks among hedge funds. Just making the list in tenth is Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON), which services the home building and aviation industries, in addition to providing software, automation, and productivity solutions for a the mining, life sciences, oil and gas, and pulp and paper industries, among others.Honeywell’s backlog is up and the company topped earnings expectations in the second quarter, so it’s performing well despite shares being off by 17% this year. The company expects to grow its organic sales by between 5% and 7% this year. Honeywell has more than doubled its dividend payments over the past decade, and the stock currently yields a solid 2.47%.Hedge fund ownership of Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) dipped by 14% during Q2 and 33% lower than its all-time highs reached during 2018 and 2019. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital and D E Shaw each own more than 1 million shares of HON as of June 30.Distillate Capital sold out of its Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) position last year, noting in its Q3 2021 investor letter that it preferred the value proposition offered by other stocks:“The largest exited positions were Oracle, which outperformed significantly, and Texas Instruments and Honeywell, which were roughly flat versus the market in the quarter but were edged out for inclusion by other stocks that became even more attractively valued.”9. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 51 General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has a wide range of segments, including a financial services division, a transportation segment that services the drilling, railroad, and marine industries, among others, as well as segments devoted to aviation, renewable energy, healthcare, oil and gas, and power. GE is set to spin off its healthcare segment in January 2023.General Electric’s orders were up 8% in the first half of the year, including 29% in the aviation segment, but supply chain issues have weighed heavily on its ability to fulfill those orders, which has put the company’s 2022 guidance in jeopardy. GE now expects that $1 billion in projected 2022 free cash flow will be pushed out to 2023, and it may still miss its reduced 2022 FCF projections. GE pays out an $0.08 quarterly dividend which gives shares an annual yield of 0.50%.Smart money ownership of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) peaked during the first quarter of 2021 but has fallen by 30% since, having declined for four of the past five quarters. Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners and Edward Eisler’s Eisler Capital sold out of their GE positions during Q2.Longleaf Partners is bullish on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)’s improved balance sheet as well as the growth potential for its primary businesses, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 55 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) operates five segments that serve a wide range of industries. Those segments are Healthcare, Industrial, Consumer, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy. 3M has over 100 manufacturing facilities spread across more than 35 countries worldwide. Some of its most well-known consumer products include Scotch tape and Post-it notes.One of many dividend kings that rank highly on the list of most diversified stocks, 3M pays out an annual dividend of $5.94 per share, which currently yields a hefty 5.39%. The stock currently sits at a nine-year low in part due to legal challenges that could see the company hit with billons in losses. If 3M can survive that hurdle, expect the stock to take off.There’s been a 31% surge this year in the number of funds long 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), pushing smart money ownership of the stock near its all-time highs. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns nearly 6.2 million MMM shares worth $802 million as of June 30, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital raised its stake in 3M by 18% during Q2 to 921,930 shares.Mayar Capital bought back into 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) this year, explaining its decision to do so in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.""7. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 While Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is best known for its eponymous oral health and soap brands, the company also sells a wide range of other products, including deodorant, shampoo, fabric softeners, and pet food.Colgate-Palmolive grew organic sales by 9% during Q2, thanks in part to inflation driving the average price of its products up by 8.5%. Inflation negatively impacted the company’s bottom line however, as adjusted earnings fell by 10% year-over-year. The dividend king also raised its dividend payments by 4.4% during Q2, giving its shares a yield of 2.68%.The number of hedge fund shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) topped 60 for the first time in the middle of 2021 and inched up by 12% during Q2 of this year. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies has been a CL shareholder for several years and owns over 4.87 million shares worth $390 million as of June 30.First Eagle Investments Global Fund, which had the largest position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database as of June 30, shared some of the reasons why it likes the stock in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of consumer staples giant Colgate-Palmolive have performed well as investors rotated into more recessionary-resilient defensive stocks amid the broader selloff during the second quarter. The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces. We continue to like Colgate- Palmolive’s dividend and previously announced $5 billion stock buyback program.”6. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 While The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is primarily a beverage giant, it does have a diverse collection of products, including its eponymous soda, as well as Minute Maid, Powerade, Fanta, Sprite, and Dasani, among others. Coca-Cola is also expanding into flavored alcoholic beverages. In certain regions, Coca-Cola also produces and/or distributes several brands that aren’t owned by the company, including Monster Energy, Nestea, and some of Dr. Pepper Snapple’s brands.Coca-Cola grew organic sales by 16% during Q2, while earnings rose by 4% in a challenging environment. The company expects to generate $10.5 billion in free cash flow, with some of that windfall finding its way back to investors in the form of dividend payments, which currently yield 3.14%. The company is also closing in on 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend payments.Hedge fund ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) hit a multi-year high at the end of 2021, but has dipped by 15% this year. Investing legend Warren Buffett remains KO’s staunchest supporter, owning an even 400 million shares worth over $25 billion as of June 30. Buffett has owned a stake in the company since 1988.The ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy bought more shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and other defensive stocks heading into a turbulent 2022, as outlined in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (Coca-Cola). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the favorite diversified companies among hedge funds.

One of them is Colgate-Palmolive. CNBC reporting that Dan Loeb's Third Point has built a stake in the company. And we should mention Yahoo Finance did reach out to Third Point for comment. We have not yet heard back at this point. The shares are trading higher by 3.4%.And the reporting over there talks about that maybe there should be a breakup of Colgate, or at least a spin-off of some of the businesses. The Pet Nutrition, Hill's Pet Nutrition is one of their divisions there. You're looking at me skeptically, or--BRIAN SOZZI: I think--JULIE HYMAN: I can see you processing, processing.BRIAN SOZZI: I dig this potential call by Dan Loeb. Why are they selling Pet Nutrition next to my toothpaste in the same-- why does it have to be together? Does that make any sense anymore? Do you use the same ingredients in toothpaste as you do in making pet products? I'm guessing no.BRAD SMITH: But don't they keep the operations separate in how they're producing those products, too? So hopefully, there's not the [INAUDIBLE] ingredients that are going into your toothpaste versus the pet food. But we know that you would be willing to try it. I was going to say--BRIAN SOZZI: I just wanted to get you to comment. I just wanted to get you to comment.BRAD SMITH: OK, all right.

American security experts expect Russian hackers to attack voting systems and stir up trouble in the final days before the midterm elections on November 8. Yahoo! Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman is here for more. Rick, interesting story you're working here.RICK NEWMAN: Yeah, and my point is that Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. He is already interfering in the US election. And it's not in the familiar ways as much that we saw in 2016 and 2020 with disinformation on social media. It's through inflation.What is the biggest issue for voters right now? It is the economy and it's inflation. Now, in the beginning of the year, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden-- President Biden used this phrase, ""the Putin price hike,"" to explain away rising oil and gasoline prices. And that wasn't really the case at the time.But we now have a different kind of inflation. It is not oil and gasoline prices anymore. I'm going to isolate two things here. It's food and it's natural gas. People do not see the price of natural gas the way they see the price of gasoline.But we've got soaring natural gas prices all around the world. That is because of the Russian war in Ukraine and the energy war that goes along with that. That is raising prices here, not by as much as it is in Europe. But they are going up, we're going to feel that.That passes through to food prices because natural gas produces electricity. You need electricity to process food. There are other factors pushing up food prices that go back to the Russian war in Ukraine and sanctions related to that. So all of this, these are all major factors that are keeping inflation high in the United States, still 8.2%. And this is President Biden's principal problem right now.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: And so for the oil reserves that are slated to be released, you know, how does that kind of play and factor into the Biden administration's strategy, at least at this point?RICK NEWMAN: So let's talk about oil for a second. So oil prices right now, last I looked, US oil around $84 a barrel. That is lower than the price before Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. So oil markets have normalized. Gas prices have not come down all the way to where they were before February 24, but they're getting pretty close. And that market has stabilized.And President Biden did release oil from the Strategic Reserve. That's a small part of it. The biggest reason the oil market has stabilized is we have a global slowdown, especially in China. So demand for oil has just come down in a way we should be happy about that.The inflation story has since shifted. And it's over to these other things. I mean, food inflation, latest numbers are 13% year-over-year. That is a big ask for a lot of people. Food is 12% of the typical household's budget, gasoline only 3%. So it's harder to absorb food inflation. And that food inflation looks pretty persistent at this point. It's going to be hard to get that down.JULIE HYMAN: So bring it back around to politics for us for a second, because the proxy for President Biden's polling, for example, and tied in with the midterms as well, has been the gasoline price because it's that one sticker price, it's easy to see. Food, while everybody feels it, you don't have that one sort of thing that's symbolic of it.RICK NEWMAN: Right.JULIE HYMAN: So how is this going to play, as gasoline comes down and food continues to go up?RICK NEWMAN: So you're right, so there has been a fairly direct correlation between gas prices and President Biden's approval rating. So the gas prices go up, Biden's approval goes down and vise versa. So that was all improving for Biden. The Democrats had momentum as gas prices were coming down sharply.But food-- then food inflation started to go up. And I think most people don't look at the CPI numbers in a spreadsheet the way I do every time the numbers come out. But people know when stuff gets more expensive. And they-- and they know that their paycheck is not going up by the same amount as expenses. And there's going to be another shock coming.People are just starting to see this in utility bills this summer because natural gas, which is the main way we generate electricity, that is going-- that is higher than it was this time last year. And that is going to mean higher heating and electricity prices over the summer. So people know-- they know something's wrong, and they're right about that.So you know, the midterm elections are a referendum on the president and his party. And normally, the president's party does lose seats in Congress. And it does look like that's what's gonna happen here.]"

Pet adoption also jumped during the pandemic.A spokeswoman for Third Point declined to comment but Loeb is expected to speak at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York later on Tuesday when he may discuss the matter.Shares of Colgate rose 3.6% in morning trading, after CNBC first reported the news.With inflation rising at a sharp pace, Loeb said the Colgate investment makes sense because the business is ""defensive"" and has the ability to raise prices.""We see shares compounding at a mid to high teens rate over the next several years just from earnings growth and the nearly 3% dividend,"" Loeb wrote, adding that any strategic actions around Hill’s or the consumer health sector ""could add materially to our expected return.""While Loeb sounded a positive note on Colgate's portfolio, he also noted that earnings growth has been disappointing and that the stock price has underperformed.Story continuesHe called on the board to take action at a time of increased activity in the consumer health sector. ""Although the Board is fairly long-tenured and not known for making bold moves, we are confident that it will act in the best interests of shareholders if Colgate becomes part of the current M&amp;A minuet in consumer health,"" he wrote.Third Point, which invests in a variety of strategies including activism, has previously pushed big-name companies, including Walt Disney and Shell to consider changes, including refreshing its board.In addition to Third Point, another hedge fund, TOMS Capital Investment Management, has also done considerable research on what changes might make Colgate more profitable, people familiar with the matter said.(Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss in New York and Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Nick Zieminski)]"

378,6f1fd276-2abf-384f-bc46-7dfec7914dfe,JNPR,2022-10-19,Juniper Networks (JNPR) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/juniper-networks-jnpr-reports-next-140102783.html,1666101662,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Juniper Networks (JNPR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis computer network equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.35 billion, up 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.57% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Juniper?For Juniper, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Juniper will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Juniper would post earnings of $0.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.42, delivering a surprise of -6.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Juniper appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

379,69f8f539-e38a-3636-89dd-0ae51c00d9d0,CMCSA,2022-10-19,Does Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Create Value For Shareholders?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-comcast-corporation-nasdaq-cmcsa-110105829.html,1666177265,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Comcast How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Comcast is:15% = US$14b ÷ US$93b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.15 in profit.Does Comcast Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Comcast has a similar ROE to the average in the Media industry classification (14%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Even if the ROE is respectable when compared to the industry, its worth checking if the firm's ROE is being aided by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesCombining Comcast's Debt And Its 15% Return On EquityComcast clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.06. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

CMCSA's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.64 as of yesterday's close.Story continuesThe Cable Television industry is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is United Rentals (URI). URI is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 8.01 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 10.28. Over the past year, URI's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.80 and as low as 7.49, with a median of 10.94.Investors will also notice that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.45. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. URI's industry has an average PEG of 1 right now. Over the last 12 months, URI's PEG has been as high as 0.96 and as low as 0.43, with a median of 0.64.Finally, investors will want to recognize that URI has a P/CF ratio of 5.09. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. URI's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 13.02. Over the past 52 weeks, URI's P/CF has been as high as 9.08 and as low as 4.44, with a median of 6.45.These are just a handful of the figures considered in United Rentals's great Value grade.

Although the current U.S. housing market slowdown, continued supply-chain bottlenecks, investments in new products and higher raw material costs may keep margins under pressure, companies like United Rentals, Inc. URI, Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. WMS, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. AWI and Arcosa, Inc. ACA are set to benefit from operational excellence, geographic and product diversification strategies, accretive buyouts and higher infrastructural spending.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry primarily comprises manufacturers, designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems, doors, and windows as well as flooring and metal products. Some industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings, ventilation products, ground-mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses as well as mail storage (solutions including mailboxes along with package delivery products). Companies in this industrial cohort also rent out equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners as well as government entities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Building Products IndustryU.S. Administration’s Infrastructural Spending: The industry players are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to aid the companies.Operational Excellence, Product Innovation &amp; Acquisitions: The industry participants have been carrying out strong cost-saving initiatives like business consolidation, system implementations, plant/branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to boost profitability. Industry participants have also been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, digitally enabled solutions as well as advanced manufacturing capabilities to boost revenues. The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth, and expand access to additional markets as well as products.Supply Chain &amp; Inflationary Woes: Inflationary headwinds with respect to transportation costs, material costs and energy costs owing to supply-chain disruptions have been a pressing concern. Also, rising labor costs are compressing margins. These are dampening the companies’ operating performance. Rising costs related to steel, asphalt, resin and other input materials are compressing margins. Although the companies have been working to recover higher costs through various price increases, they expect this ongoing volatility in material and transportation costs to persist in the near term. Meanwhile, the companies have been witnessing short-term project delays due to material and labor shortages that are impacting upstream building activity. This may result in a lower backlog in the near term.Apart from higher raw material costs, the companies bear expenses related to product launches. If companies are unable to offset these costs through price increases or supply chain initiatives, their profits may be affected.Also, as the industry players’ business prospects are highly correlated with U.S. housing market conditions and repair and remodeling activity, the current slowdown in the market may prove detrimental.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry is a 27-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #65, which places it in the top 26% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

Since August 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2022 and 2023 have been revised 3.6% and 4.5% upward to $3.73 per share and $3.96 per share, respectively.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Construction sector over the past year.Over this period, the industry has lost 27.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 21.8% and the broader sector’s 24.9% decrease.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Construction sector over the past year.Over this period, the industry has lost 27.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 21.8% and the broader sector’s 24.9% decrease.One-Year Price Performance4 Building Product Stocks to Buy NowWe have selected four stocks from the Zacks universe of building products that currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

For example, Oracle B2B Commerce will provide integrations with J.P.

CEO Chris Cocks saying during the earnings call that the company is seeing, quote, ""average consumer becoming increasingly price sensitive as the year has progressed.""Hasbro reported net income of $129 million. That's down from 253 million one year earlier. Hasbro, like many in the sector, had inflated inventory, and as a result, leaned heavily into promotions, cutting profits. They are optimistic though about an unprecedented lineup of entertainment in Q4.That, of course, starts with ""Wakanda Forever,"" which will be released on November 11th. What are shares doing? They're down about 3% on the day and down 35% year-to-date. This just jumped out at me, Rachelle, because look, almost every earnings we've seen hasn't shown the calamitous predictions of recession. This is the first one to show at least a bit of a weakening consumer in the holiday season. Not a disaster, but at least a hint of what might be coming.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And it's interesting because when you bring up the idea of inventory, it's different if you're selling something like towels, but things like toys, they're trendy, they're seasonal. People don't want last year's toys that are just now coming in, when you have things like ""Wakanda Forever"" coming out.They want the newest, the latest. So I think that might be a more unique headwind, if you're someone who's in toy sales.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and this is a company that has struggled, year-to-date off 36%. I thought it was interesting, though looking at the analyst commentary after we got these results. MKM was out and they actually took a positive spin. Obviously for this current quarter the results weren't too strong, but they were reassured, just in terms of the fact that Hasbro reaffirmed their guidance.So that was enough for them to at least not be bearish on the stock for now, but you mentioned that 36% drop for shares. The fact that it's been under tremendous amount of pressure going into holiday season, if they don't see, they're not too bullish, it could be a couple of rough quarters ahead for that.DAVE BRIGGS: They'll need a big Q4.]"

This is an exciting partnership in the food space. McDonald's is going to sell Krispy Kreme donuts at nine store locations in Kentucky this month. Both companies up today. Maybe something of that has to do with the news that we got. Now McDonald's saying the menu shake up could reveal how adding bakery items would impact its restaurants. Customers are going to be able to get the original glazed, chocolate iced with sprinkles, the raspberry-filled donuts.And that is not all the news coming out from McDonald's today. They're also back with their Halloween buckets. And we've got this McBoo bucket on set for you guys. A very exciting thing, bringing it back right in time for the Halloween holiday and returning after six years. So they're doing all they can to try to add some excitement here to their menu, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, I do love the idea of the Krispy Kreme partnership. And they say you can either get them as the three-pack or part of a six-pack. I need very little motivation as an impulse buyer to sort of be like, oh, yeah, let me grab that as well. So I will probably be-- when it eventually comes here-- right now, it's just limited to Louisville, Kentucky. So lucky for you, sad for us.I think these Boo buckets, though, are absolutely adorable. I think they should have put the meal inside the bucket. But Dave, you have theories about why that's not the best idea.DAVE BRIGGS: McDonald's has got your back. They're putting it in a bag so it stays warm. You don't want those fries in a bucket and cooling off in the environment around it. That is smart. Plus, you don't want it stinking up your candy for the candy that's going to go in there on Halloween. Let me say this, McDonald's. If you don't put a breakfast sandwich on a Krispy Kreme donut, I am dearly disappointed in you. It's easy-- sausage, egg, and cheese on two Krispy kremes. I don't know what we'll call it.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: That's a heart attack in a sandwich.DAVE BRIGGS: McKrispy Kreme?RACHELLE AKUFFO: That's called a trip to the dentist. That's too much.SEANA SMITH: Dentist?DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, come on.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, a hospital.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Krispy Kreme and everything else on there?DAVE BRIGGS: Krispy Kreme--RACHELLE AKUFFO: Oh, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: --breakfast sandwich with sausage, egg, and cheese. You can thank me later, McDonald's. You can thank me later. But they also have adult happy meals.SEANA SMITH: They do, and they've been a huge hit.DAVE BRIGGS: The toys in them have been--RACHELLE AKUFFO: Collectibles.DAVE BRIGGS: --flying. They've become collectibles. I don't know that the Happy Meal itself has been that popular, but the toys sure have. We're going to get a look at their earnings next week. I hate to be the wonky guy. But it'll be interesting because the lower income bracket. It will be interesting to see if their cutbacks on that side of things, despite all these promotions.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, definitely will give us a good gauge just in terms of how hard inflation is hitting everyday Americans. I think this is really, really cute. This is the McBoo. They also have a McPumpkin and a McGoblin. I like what they're doing here.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I'll be sure to get mine. We'll have to leave it there. That'll do it for today's Yahoo Finance Live. We'll be back tomorrow at 3:00 PM Eastern for all of your coverage leading up to and after the closing bell.DAVE BRIGGS: Nice to have you here in studio.SEANA SMITH: Yes!RACHELLE AKUFFO: Thank you.]"
409,092253c7-8f49-3699-8bdb-16ab5bbfca03,MCD,2022-10-19,10 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-recession-proof-stocks-buy-195421882.html,1666122861,STORY,"['TGT', 'MCD', 'DLTR', 'KHC', 'BG', 'HD', 'JNJ']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best recession-proof stocks to buy in October. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October. The aftershocks of the coronavirus pandemic are still being felt all over the globe. The virus saw industrial output collapse and led to widespread layoffs and income loss. This in turn motivated central banks to reduce interest rates to stimulate economic activity and give out cash assistance to help families navigate the tough economic environment.However, all these actions were not without consequence and now, the result of excess capital flowing into the market has resulted in increasing the demand for the products and as a result spurring price growth or inflation. To counter inflation, central banks like the Federal Reserve are raising interest rates to take this capital out of the industry, and this will lead to a recession as businesses find it hard to find capital and end up reducing output.Commenting on the risk of a recession, hedge fund owner Bill Ackman was optimistic and in an interview given in October 2022, he said:Look I don't think it's knowable whether or not we're going to have a recession. You know it used to be we had economic cycles with recessions, it's been an awfully long time, but if the Federal Reserve got behind in raising rates and now they're gonna have to be more aggressive. I mean you look at what's going on in housing, people got used to a 3% mortgage rate and now it's 6%+ and that's causing the housing market to slow down fairly rapidly. Housing's a very important part of our economy. So if rate rises have that effect more broadly, then I think it's likely that you're gonna have a recession. If the Fed raises rates pretty quickly, which was our kind of recommendation more than a year ago, and you can sort of cut off inflation and get it trending in the right direction, then there don't have to be as severe and don't have to, if you will force us into a severe recession. But I think sometime in 2023 it's absolutely within the realm of possibility that we're gonna have a recession for sure.Story continuesEconomists polled by Bloomberg Magazine are more pessimistic than Mr. Ackman, with the latest report outlining that by October 2023, there is a 100% chance of a recession. Another poll of different economists suggests that the probability of a recession is at 60% over the next 12 months, up by 10% since last month's estimates.Therefore, a potential recession merits a different investment approach and involves selecting companies and industries that supply products that are essential. In this piece, we take a look at some of these stocks, with the top picks being Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD).10 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy in October Photo by Darla Hueske on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe studied different industries that have the best odds of stable demand during an economic downturn and then selected the top players in these sectors.

The company also lifted prices by 4% in August, which should have supported sales.A Chipotle Mexican Grill is seen the day before it announces its first quarter results, in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 25, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonChipotle CEO Brian Niccol said that the chain is thriving amid the economic slowdown by catering to more affluent households.""Our brand is positioned in a really great spot,"" Niccol said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. ""Obviously, we have some higher household income on average in our customers. We also skew younger but we serve pretty much all income groups. And I don't love to see some of the lower income groups being impacted the way they have, but we're fortunate that we're positioned the way we are with our commitment to food with integrity,""Here are further details behind Goldman's call on Chipotle's stock:OverviewRating: BuyPrice Target: $1,840Upside Assumed: +20%Goldman's longer-term call on Chipotle is a combination of bullishness on opening new restaurants and pricing power in addition to continued menu innovation.""We continue to view Chipotle as one of the most compelling growth stocks in the industry given the strong top-line (unit growth and SSS) and leading margin profile. Chipotle continues to leverage its strong digital foundation, premium protein LTO strategy to drive incremental traffic and average check (see analysis below on the new Garlic Guajillo Steak limited-time offering), and pricing power to offset inflation impacts and sustain already-strong restaurant level margins.""Story continuesEasing inflation should also help support Chipotle's profit margins.""Food cost pressure appears to be easing, room for possible margin upside. The price of several key commodity inputs for Chipotle have improve in recent months — including avocados and chicken thighs, and while chicken thighs were still inflationary throughout 3Q22, we are encouraged around the recent moderation and see this driving potential margin upside for 4Q. Overall, we see less risk that inflationary food costs will drive an earnings/margin miss for Chipotle in 3Q22/4Q22, and believe that the less inflationary environment does give the company more price cushion should they begin to see consumers becoming more price-conscious.""In terms of labor, Goldman noted that ""the hiring/staffing environment appears to be easing and wage inflation levels are decelerating... With that being said, we do believe that there may be upside risk to labor margins should in-restaurant traffic continue to rebound (traffic was +3.5-4% in 2Q, and in-restaurant orders grew at ~35% year over year in 1H22) and should digital levels remain firm (low ~40% range). Restaurant throughput was a key topic of discussion during Chipotle's 2Q22 earnings call as the company works to improving onboarding and training for the vast amount of new employees hired over the last year, and we expect to be given an update on efficiency/labor initiatives currently underway as we see this as another underlying driver of same-store sales momentum as Chipotle recovers towards historical.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have declined -9.5% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 decline of -19.9%. The company is going thorough a phase of unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. It expects higher commodity and freight costs to persist in fiscal 2023.That said, what has helped the stock hold its ground in the ongoing market sell off is the stability and resilience of its business across all stages of the economic cycle. We saw this in the last quarterly report and will most likely get more confirmation of that in the Q3 earnings report on October 19th.Management issued a favorable view for fiscal 2023 at the time of the last quarterly release. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Coca-Cola shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year (+2.9% vs. -19.9%). The company’s top and bottom lines surpassed estimates for the sixth straight quarter in the last quarterly report on July 26th and it is reasonable to expect a replay of that performance in next week's Q3 release. The company’s results reflect elasticity in the marketplace despite the ongoing global challenges. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. It raised the organic revenues and comparable earnings per share growth guidance for 2022. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.However, pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are also concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have declined -1.0% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 decline of -19.9%. The company’s production is impacted by the natural decline in the oil and natural gas fields. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. TotalEnergies operates in some politically-troubled regions, and the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict might affect profitability.However, TotalEnergies continues to gain from startups, increased commodity prices, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TotalEnergies is making regular investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include McDonald's Corporation (MCD), Prologis, Inc.

However, rising supply and rate hikes are woes.Pre-Salt Reserves Boosts Petrobras (PBR), Debt Pile HurtsWhile Petrobras' stakes in Brazil's attractive pre-salt oil reservoirs should boost its earnings outlook, the Zacks analyst is concerned over the company's huge debt load of more than $34 billion.Strong Demand Aids Northrop (NOC), Supply Chain Issue Woes Per the Zacks Analyst, strong demand for defense products tend to boost Northrop's long-term growth. However, COVID induced supply chain shortages might hurt the stock???s results.Rising High-Value Solution Mix Aids Micron Technology (MU)Per the Zacks analyst, Micron's rising mix of high-value solutions and 5G adoption in IoT devices is expected to partially offset the negative impact of declining memory chip demand from PC vendors.Loyalty Program Aid McDonald's (MCD), Dismal China Comps HurtsPer the Zacks analyst, McDonald's new loyalty program, store growth and robust global comps growth continues to drive the company's performance.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 2.2%, which is in line with the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for McDonald's McDonald's' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Based on the last payment, McDonald's was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 44.0%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 51% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendMcDonald's Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2012, the annual payment back then was $2.80, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $5.52. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.0% a year over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.McDonald's Could Grow Its DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that McDonald's has grown earnings per share at 6.0% per year over the past five years. The company is paying a reasonable amount of earnings to shareholders, and is growing earnings at a decent rate so we think it could be a decent dividend stock.McDonald's Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. As an example, we've identified 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE: PLD), the global leader in logistics real estate, today reported results for the third quarter of 2022.Net earnings per diluted share was $1.36 for the quarter compared with $0.97 for the third quarter of 2021. Core funds from operations (Core FFO)* per diluted share was $1.73 for the quarter compared with $1.04 for the same period in 2021. The third quarter of 2022 included $0.57 of net promote income, while the same period in 2021 included $0.01.""Our record results for the quarter point to the continued strength of our business; however, given the impact of aggressive Fed tightening and the rapid change in market sentiment, we will run our company assuming an economic slowdown,"" said Hamid R. Moghadam, co-founder and CEO, Prologis. ""We have built our portfolio to outperform and our balance sheet to be resilient throughout cycles - we view this as a time of opportunity. We will remain patient to capitalize on growth opportunities as they emerge.""OPERATING PERFORMANCE Owned &amp; Managed3Q22NotesAverage Occupancy97.7 %Leases Commenced51.0MSF45.2MSF operating portfolio and 5.8MSF development portfolioRetention76.4 %Prologis Share3Q22NotesNet Effective Rent Change59.7 %All-time high; Led by U.S. at 67.0%Cash Rent Change38.5 %Cash Same Store NOI*9.3 %All-time high; Led by Europe at 10.6%DUKE PORTFOLIO EXPANDS MARKETS, CUSTOMERS AND OPPORTUNITIESThe acquisition of Duke Realty Corporation, which closed on October 3, 2022, provides Prologis with additional growth from high-quality properties and more than 500 new customers. Having completed the integration and accomplished day-one cost synergies, the company will now focus on building accretion through incremental property cash flows and Essentials income.

Arndt, chief financial officer. ""Additionally, our embedded lease mark-to-market continued to expand to 62%, and we have substantially insulated our earnings and equity from foreign currency movements over the next several years.""During the third quarter, Prologis and its co-investment ventures issued $3.1 billion of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%, and a weighted average term of 7.5 years. This activity includes $1.2 billion in green bonds. Year-to-date, Prologis and its co-investment ventures issued $10.8 billion of debt at a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and a weighted average term of 7.0 years.""The capital markets remain open for us, as demonstrated by our most recent green bond raise in late September,"" Arndt added. ""This is a testament to the hard work and discipline we have exhibited in building an industry-leading balance sheet.""The company has maintained its leading liquidity position with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and availability on its credit facilities. As of September 30, 2022, debt as a percentage of total market capitalization was 20.7%, and the company's weighted average interest rate on its share of total debt was 1.9% with a weighted average term of 9.6 years. In addition, the company has no significant debt maturities until 2026.FOREIGN CURRENCY STRATEGYPrologis hedges its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by borrowing in the currencies in which it invests and using derivative financial instruments. As of September 30, 2022, 95% of Prologis' equity was in USD and Core FFO* forecasted in foreign currencies for 2023, 2024 and 2025 were 99%, 98% and 95%, respectively, hedged through derivative contracts.2022 GUIDANCE ""While confident as ever about the resiliency of our business, we are exercising caution in the near term,"" said Arndt. ""Accordingly, we are taking a more conservative approach in how we choose to allocate our capital, and are therefore lowering our guidance for development starts, dispositions and contributions while we closely monitor the market.""2022 GUIDANCEEarnings (per diluted share)PreviousRevisedChange at M.P.Net Earnings$5.15 to $5.25$4.25 to $4.30(17.8) %Core FFO*$5.14 to $5.18$5.12 to $5.14**(0.6) %Core FFO, excluding net promote income*$4.54 to $4.58$4.60 to $4.621.1 %OperationsAverage occupancy97.25% to 97.75%97.25% to 97.75%- bpsCash Same Store NOI* - PLD share8.25% to 8.75%8.50% to 8.75%12.5 bpsStrategic Capital (in millions)PreviousRevised Change at M.P.Strategic Capital revenue,excluding promote revenue$550 to $560$535 to $545(2.7) %Net promote income$460$420(8.7) %G&amp;A (in millions)General &amp; administrative expenses$315 to $320$325 to $3303.1 %Capital Deployment – Prologis Share (in millions)Development stabilizations$2,300 to $2,600$2,700 to $3,00016.3 %Development starts$4,500 to $5,000$4,200 to $4,600(7.4) %Acquisitions$1,200 to $1,700$1,900 to $2,10037.9 %Contributions$1,600 to $1,900$800 to $900(51.4) %Dispositions$1,900 to $2,200$1,300 to $1,400(34.1) %Net sources/(uses) $(2,200) to $(2,600)$(4,000) to $(4,400)$(1,800)Realized development gains$750 to $850$400 to $500$(350)*This is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Notes and Definitions in our supplemental information for further explanation and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.**The decrease in Core FFO 2022 guidance was mostly attributed to lower promote guidance.The earnings guidance described above gives effect to the acquisition of Duke Realty Corporation that closed on October 3, 2022, as well as potential gains recognized from real estate transactions but excludes any future or potential foreign currency or derivative gains or losses as our guidance assumes constant foreign currency rates. In reconciling from net earnings to Core FFO*, Prologis makes certain adjustments, including but not limited to real estate depreciation and amortization expense, gains (losses) recognized from real estate transactions and early extinguishment of debt, impairment charges, deferred taxes and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency or derivative activity. The difference between the company's Core FFO* and net earnings guidance for 2022 relates predominantly to these items. Please refer to our quarterly Supplemental Information, which is available on our Investor Relations website at https://ir.prologis.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov for a definition of Core FFO* and other non-GAAP measures used by Prologis, along with reconciliations of these items to the closest GAAP measure for our results and guidance.OCTOBER 19, 2022, CALL DETAILS The call will take place on Wednesday, October 19, 2022, at 9:00 a.m. PT/12:00 p.m. ET.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble have declined -9.5% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 decline of -19.9%. The company is going thorough a phase of unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, product and packaging investments and other impacts hurt margins. It expects higher commodity and freight costs to persist in fiscal 2023.That said, what has helped the stock hold its ground in the ongoing market sell off is the stability and resilience of its business across all stages of the economic cycle. We saw this in the last quarterly report and will most likely get more confirmation of that in the Q3 earnings report on October 19th.Management issued a favorable view for fiscal 2023 at the time of the last quarterly release. It witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.(You can read the full research report on Procter &amp; Gamble here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Coca-Cola shares have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past year (+2.9% vs. -19.9%). The company’s top and bottom lines surpassed estimates for the sixth straight quarter in the last quarterly report on July 26th and it is reasonable to expect a replay of that performance in next week's Q3 release. The company’s results reflect elasticity in the marketplace despite the ongoing global challenges. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. It raised the organic revenues and comparable earnings per share growth guidance for 2022. It is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments.However, pressures from higher supply chain costs, including transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are also concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have declined -1.0% over the past year against the S&amp;P 500 decline of -19.9%. The company’s production is impacted by the natural decline in the oil and natural gas fields. It remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. TotalEnergies operates in some politically-troubled regions, and the ongoing Russia and Ukraine conflict might affect profitability.However, TotalEnergies continues to gain from startups, increased commodity prices, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TotalEnergies is making regular investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include McDonald's Corporation (MCD), Prologis, Inc.

PLD is slated to report third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 19 before the bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on three occasions and missed on the other, the average beat being 0.71%.This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayDespite economic headwinds and uncertainty and recession woes in the third quarter, U.S. industrial market fundamentals remained strong and steady, per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, with “heightened levels of absorption” and rents scaling new highs.There was a net absorption of 108.2 million square feet (msf) of space in the September-end quarter, a level consistent with strong demand. It marks the eighth straight quarter where absorption surpassed the 100 msf mark. Moreover, the new leasing activity reached 163.1 msf in the third quarter.The U.S. industrial vacancy rate remained “tight” at 3.2%, denoting a 20-basis point (bps) quarter-over-quarter uptick. Moreover, each region in the United States once again reported vacancy rates sub-4%, with the lowest being the West region at only 2.5%.With elevated demand and high occupancy rates, rental rates continued to scale to new heights. The U.S. overall industrial asking rental rate ended the third quarter at $8.70 per square foot, denoting a 4% sequential increase and a 22% annual surge. It marked the strongest year-over-year growth rate recorded, per the CWK report.Prologis is well-poised to benefit from this favorable trend, given its capacity to offer modern logistics facilities at strategic in-fill locations. PLD is anticipated to have witnessed healthy demand on the fast adoption of e-commerce, with leasing activity getting support in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, with global supply chains transforming for faster fulfillment and resilience, Prologis is likely to have captured favorable fundamentals with its differentiated customer offerings and robust investment activity in the to-be-reported quarter.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Prologis has decent balance sheet strength to fuel its growth endeavors. A market leader, this REIT has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.13 billion, suggesting an 8.9% year-over-year jump.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share of $1.72 calls for a 65.4% increase year over year.However, with the asset category being attractive, there is a development boom in many markets. Per the CWK report, development activity picked up pace in the third quarter, with 148.2 msf of industrial facilities being delivered throughout the United States, the highest quarterly total on record.Also, the industrial construction pipeline reached another all-time high of 716.9 msf in the third quarter, 2.6% ahead of the previous high a quarter ago. The high supply is likely to have intensified competition during the September-end quarter.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Prologis does not have the right combination of two key elements — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an FFO beat.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Prologis is -2.47%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PLD currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are two stocks from the REIT sector — Equity Residential EQR and Highwoods Properties, Inc. HIW — you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Equity Residential is slated to report quarterly numbers on Oct 25. EQR has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) presently.Highwoods Properties, Inc., scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

417,53971060-5774-337d-9758-4093a705e5f0,STX,2022-10-19,Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 80% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/seagate-technology-holdings-plc-nasdaq-193250796.html,1666121570,STORY,['STX'],"[A look at the shareholders of Seagate Technology Holdings plc (NASDAQ:STX) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 80% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Seagate Technology Holdings. See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Seagate Technology Holdings?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Seagate Technology Holdings. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Seagate Technology Holdings' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 6.5% of Seagate Technology Holdings. That worth noting, since hedge funds are often quite active investors, who may try to influence management. Many want to see value creation (and a higher share price) in the short term or medium term. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 12%. With 6.5% and 6.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and ValueAct Capital Management, L.P. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 50% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Seagate Technology HoldingsThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Seagate Technology Holdings plc insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$52m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Seagate Technology Holdings. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Seagate Technology Holdings (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NYSE:RHI), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Robert Half International’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Robert Half International What Is Robert Half International Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.3% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Robert Half International today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $88.49, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Robert Half International’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Robert Half International?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Robert Half International, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -9.1%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, RHI appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on RHI for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The price seems to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on RHI should the price fluctuate below its true value.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Paccar (PCAR), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this truck maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 14.14%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Paccar came out with earnings of $2.07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81 per share, representing a surprise of 14.36%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.72 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.91%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Paccar, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paccar has an Earnings ESP of +0.45% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 25, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis truck maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +86.1%.Revenues are expected to be $6.73 billion, up 42.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.95% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paccar?For Paccar, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paccar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paccar would post earnings of $1.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.07, delivering a surprise of +14.36%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paccar appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How Quickly Is United Parcel Service Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that United Parcel Service has managed to grow EPS by 32% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of United Parcel Service shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 8.8% to 14% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for United Parcel Service.Story continuesAre United Parcel Service Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of United Parcel Service, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$115m. This comes in at 0.08% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Is United Parcel Service Worth Keeping An Eye On?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into United Parcel Service's strong EPS growth. With EPS growth rates like that, it's hardly surprising to see company higher-ups place confidence in the company through continuing to hold a significant investment. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. You still need to take note of risks, for example - United Parcel Service has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.2%.Revenues are expected to be $235 million, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.73% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PJT Partners will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates.

American Express also benefited from better volumes and higher Card Member spending due to a significant rebound in Travel and Entertainment spending. AXP added 3.2 million proprietary cards in the quarter. However, the positives were partially offset by higher operating costs.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38 for third-quarter earnings per share has witnessed three upward revisions and one downward movement in the past month. The estimate is indicative of a 4.9% increase from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimates suggest earnings to be $2.31 per share in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $13.5 billion, suggesting a jump of 23.7% from the year-ago reported figure. We expect third-quarter revenues to witness a 23.1% year-over-year increase.American Express beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 17.7%. This is depicted in the graph below.American Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Express Company price-eps-surprise | American Express Company QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for American Express this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently +4.11%. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.48 per share, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Story continuesZacks Rank: American Express currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected EarningsAmEx is likely to have witnessed improved volumes in the to-be-reported quarter, a trend seen over the last few quarters. It might have expanded, owing to total network volumes and billed business volumes. A rise in the overall spending level is likely to have boosted Discount revenues, AXP’s largest revenue driver.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Discount revenues indicates 19.7% year-over-year growth. Our estimate suggests a 25.3% year-over-year increase in Discount revenues for the quarter under review.Travel and Entertainment (T&amp;E) is rapidly increasing in most parts of the world, overcoming the COVID-19 woes. T&amp;E spending is expected to have increased in the third quarter of 2022. Fees, commissions and other revenues might have improved on the back of an uptick in travel-related revenues. Card acquisitions in some of AXP’s largest travel co-brand portfolios are likely to have increased.Cards-in-force is expected to have witnessed an uptick in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total cards-in-force signals a 10.1% year-over-year jump. Our estimate projects total cards-in-force to rise 9.3% year over year.American Express’s net interest income, the second-largest revenue contributor, is likely to have risen on higher loan disbursements. The consensus mark for AXP’s net interest income suggests an upside of 21% from the year-ago reported figure.We expect the figure to increase 14.1% from the year-ago period. Further, we expect Global Merchant and Network Services’ pre-tax income to have witnessed a 47% year-over-year surge.The above-mentioned factors are likely to have set the company up for an earnings beat and year-over-year increase in the third quarter. However, the rising expenses in global commercial services, marketing and business development might have partially offset the bottom line. Our estimate suggests a 28.3% year-over-year increase in total expenses in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies from the broader finance space that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Axos Financial, Inc. AX has an Earnings ESP of +4.06% and is a Zacks #1 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axos Financial’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.13 per share, implying a 9.7% improvement from the year-ago figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings has moved down 1% in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Pentair this time around.

The pool business is benefiting from a large installed base and a shift to more autonomous and energy-efficient pools. The impacts of robust demand and solid order trends are likely to be reflected in third-quarter 2022 results.The commercial filtration business has picked up lately as the restaurant and hospitality industries have reopened. The company’s efforts to expand in the areas of the pool as well as residential and commercial water treatment through acquisitions,introduction of water-treatment solutions, investments and innovations are likely to have contributed to the Consumer Solutions segment’s performance in the reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Solutions segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $685 million, suggesting an improvement of 12% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit for the quarter is pinned at $164 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 14%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial &amp; Flow Technologies segment’s revenues is pegged at $366 million, indicating an improvement of 3% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for the segment’s operating profit stands at $56 million, suggesting growth of 8% from $52 million reported a year ago.Pentair has been witnessing inflationary increases due to high demand, a tight supply of raw materials such as metals, resins and electronics along with rising logistics costs. While it has been implementing pricing actions and focusing on productivity improvements that may have contributed to these increases, supply-chain pressures and inflationary increases are likely to have weighed on the quarter’s performance.Story continuesPrice PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of the company have declined 42.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s plunge of 48.6%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some Industrial Products stocks, which according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:The Timken Company TKR currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.41% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

439,3f18eaed-c7e2-3898-b42a-348971463033,TSCO,2022-10-19,Earnings Preview: MarineMax (HZO) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-marinemax-hzo-q4-140102752.html,1666101662.0,STORY,"['HZO', 'TSCO']","[The market expects MarineMax (HZO) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis recreational boat dealer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -19.3%.Revenues are expected to be $508.95 million, up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MarineMax?For MarineMax, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that MarineMax will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MarineMax would post earnings of $3.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.17, delivering a surprise of +2.92%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.MarineMax doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Tractor Supply (TSCO) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.28 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Tractor Supply has been revised 0.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.32%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Tractor Supply will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

441,c1d7e3fd-9484-3744-8d4b-ed706c48782f,MDLZ,2022-10-19,10 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-food-stocks-buy-135105565.html,1666101065,STORY,"['HSY', 'SYY', 'GIS', 'SPTN', 'UNFI', 'DAR', 'MDLZ', 'PEP']","[In this article we present the list of 10 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now.The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the food stocks that hedge funds are investing billions of dollars into.Food stocks are among the safest havens for investors during economic downturns like the one we’re experiencing, as they are the most essential consumer staple there is. No matter how much people are struggling financially, they have to buy food to eat.That’s been borne out during the current inflationary period, as food sales volumes have been essentially flat despite food prices skyrocketing by more than 10% year-to-date. In the United States, inflation jumped by 9.1% year-over-year in June, with the food index rising by 1% month-over-month. That followed a 1.2% escalation in food prices during May.In Canada, food prices have experienced the fourth-highest level of inflation among product groupings tracked by Statistics Canada, rising by 9.8% year-over-year through August. That trailed only the transportation, energy, and nondurable goods categories in terms of yearly inflation.That sales volumes are flat even as prices have shot up during a challenging economic environment highlights not only the obvious necessity of food in our daily lives, but also some of the innovations and initiatives that are spurring global food sales. Among them is the shift to healthier and more natural meals, snacks and ingredients, which carry a premium price tag. The healthy snacks category has enjoyed close to 20% sales growth over the past two years.Another trend that is benefiting some of the packaged goods and snack food companies on this list is the consumer shift from eating full meals to so-called grazing instead, otherwise known as snacking or eating quick ready-made products. With consumers trying to rein in their grocery bills, preparing costlier full-scale meals and making trips to the restaurant are being bypassed in favor of quicker and cheaper alternatives.Story continuesA quick look at stock performance shows the divergent paths that restaurant stocks and food stocks are on, as the AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF has sank by 22% this year, while the Invesco Dynamic Food &amp; Beverage ETF (with the great PBJ ticker) is down by just 4.5%, greatly outperforming the broader market.With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best food stocks to invest in now according to a collection of some of the savviest investors on the planet.10 Best Food Stocks to Buy NowOur MethodologyThe following food stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

MDLZ has been battling cost inflation and supply-chain headwinds for a while now. These hurdles worsened due to the Ukraine war.  However, the company’s strong pricing efforts have been working well.Mondelez has also been gaining from strength in emerging markets and its focus on strengthening the snacking category. Let’s delve deeper.What’s Weighing on Mondelez?In the second quarter of 2022, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 210 basis points (bps) to 37.9% due to increased raw material and transportation costs and an adverse mix. Also, the adjusted operating income margin contracted by 110 bps to 15.1% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix.Mondelez is seeing input cost inflation, especially for energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. The company is also navigating through supply-chain bottlenecks due to labor shortages at third parties.Management’s guidance for 2022 reflects anticipation of the elevated cost of goods sold inflation, the timing impact of extra pricing actions and the impacts of the Ukraine war. While commodity cost inflation may ease, management expects other costs, such as wages, to reflect considerable inflation.Apart from input cost inflation, the guidance includes investments to support brands and other growth-oriented investments.Mondelez’s vast global presence exposes it to the risk of volatile foreign currency movements. On its second-quarter 2022 earnings call, management stated that currency movements are likely to negatively impact net revenues by nearly 5% and the adjusted EPS by 22 cents in 2022.Shares of the company have dropped 6.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Offering RespiteSolid pricing actions have been offering support to Mondelez. In the second quarter of 2022, pricing actions boosted organic net revenue growth and offered partial respite to the company’s adjusted gross profit margin and adjusted operating margin. These were otherwise hurt by cost inflation and an adverse mix.The company remains encouraged by the underlying emerging market strength. In the second quarter of 2022, revenues from emerging markets increased by 22.4% to $2,806 million while rising 22.5% on an organic basis. The company saw strength in all major business units.Story continuesOn its second-quarter earnings call, Mondelez stated that consumer confidence was reverting to pre-pandemic levels in emerging markets. The company’s core categories saw robust volumes and penetration growth despite higher pricing.    Mondelez has been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions. The company has been expanding its snacking category.As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.On Aug 2, 2022, Mondelez acquired Clif Bar, which boasts a robust snack bar business worth more than 1 billion. On Apr 25, the company announced that it inked a deal to buy Ricolino, which is likely to strengthen its Mexican footprint.In January 2022, the company acquired Chipita S.A., which is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from this acquisition boosted net revenues in the quarter under review.Mondelez is committed to increasing its focus on areas with higher growth potential. The company divested its beverage assets in 2021 and used the net proceeds as investment in its brands and growth drivers. On its second-quarter 2022 earnings call, Mondelez unveiled plans to offload its developed market Gum &amp; Halls businesses to increase its focus on its faster-growing chocolate and biscuit businesses.These upsides should aid this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth.Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked stocks from the sector are Lancaster Colony LANC, Lamb Weston LW and TreeHouse Foods THS.Lancaster Colony, which manufactures and markets food products for the retail and foodservice markets, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy).

443,52a06e80-b30f-34da-be90-0e452555d388,OXY,2022-10-19,10 Oil Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To Ignore,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-oil-stocks-buy-too-170857294.html,1666112937,STORY,"['NG=F', 'CL=F', 'NAT', 'ERF', 'MGY', 'ASC', 'KOS', 'OXY', 'XOM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the ten oil stocks that are too cheap to ignore. To jump straight to the top five stocks in this list, head on over to 5 Oil Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore. At a time when the global economy is under severe strain due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia, injected fresh life into crude oil prices when it announced a large production cut to ensure that prices remained above $90/barrel. This made oil prices jump again, and cemented the need for non-OPEC oil suppliers.In this backdrop, and despite the ongoing push towards renewable energy, the oil industry will continue to perform strongly. This assumption is backed by a host of market research reports, which analyze the oil industry as a whole and break it down into bite sized chunks for a deeper analysis. For instance, a report from The Business Research Company, which takes a look at the global crude oil market, estimates that this market was worth $1.35 trillion in 2021, and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.2% this year to sit at $1.41 million by year end. This in itself marks $60 billion growth, and if this wasn't enough, the research firm goes on to add that from 2022 to 2026, the industry will grow at 1% to be worth $1.47 trillion.Another report, this time from Global Market Insights, wagers that the oil and gas infrastructure market was worth $620 billion in 2021, and it will grow at 6% from 2022 to 2030 to be worth $1.15 trillion - almost equaling the crude oil market's current value. Driving the growth will be non-conventional exploration methods such as shale exploration and tight gas, with some aid from technological innovations aiding more efficient production and government policies favoring more exploration. These assumptions are bolstered by recent trends that have spurred the growth in liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and exploration, with this fuel providing the double advantages of being environmentally friendly and easily available.Story continuesFinally, 360 Research Reports also takes a look at the oil and gas pipeline market. Its research suggests that this sector, which consists of a variety of steel pipes and oil and natural gas delivery channels, was worth $40 billion this year, and from now till 2028, it will grow at a CAGR of 8% to be worth $64 billion.Bill Perkins of Skylar Capital pointed out the under-investment in the oil markets in the wake of the oil output cut and explained that:I think it's pretty significant because they're cutting into a tightening market. There's under-investment into oil and oil drilling. It's one of the points they've been making is the price signal of the markets isn't really enough to induce the investment or the supply response that we need. So that's an interesting argument that OPEC is coming out and saying hey, prices are too low for investment. It's one of the things they're saying.Against this backdrop, we've made a list of cheap oil stocks for you today, with some top firms being Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO).10 Oil Stocks To Buy That Are Too Cheap To IgnorePhoto by Jeff W on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe took a broad look at the oil industry to take stock of the countless firms operating in it and then selected them based on their share price, fundamentals, and market dynamics.

It is part of the Capital One Travel Premier Collection. Capital One TravelAt a time when rivals banks such as Chase, Citi, American Express and US Bancorp are trying to improve their travel offerings, Capital One Travel plans to introduce 10x rewards for bookings in a new luxury hotel collection, and partnered with Chef José Andrés Group in a novel airport lounge concept.Travelers who have a Capital One Venture X card in their wallets will have the ability to earn 10x miles per dollar for bookings of stays at properties in Capital One Travel’s Premier Collection, a new luxury hotel mashup that Capital One Travel said it will launch later in 2022. The credit card company stated that the earn rate is industry leading.The Premier Collection, which would have hotels bookable through the Capital One Travel portal, powered by Hopper, includes “hundreds” of properties from Small Luxury Hotels, The Leading Hotels of the World, Six Senses, 1 Hotels, and Proper Hotels, as well as individually contracted hotels, Capital One Travel stated.For example, the hotels include The Ned NoMad in New York City, Euphoria Retreat in Greece, and The Plettenberg in South Africa.Capital One launched the Venture X card in 2021. Cardholders would be able to earn hotel loyalty points and achieve status when the properties in the Premier Collection have their own loyalty programs in addition to earning the 10x miles.But even for the hotels in the collection that don’t have loyalty programs, as well as those that do, Venture X cardholders are eligible for a $100 credit (or the equivalent in local currency) on restaurants, spas and other activities; breakfast for two; free Wi-Fi; and upgrades, and early check-in or late checkout when available.Matt Knise, who heads travel and spend experience and is a Capital One managing vice president, said customers wanted an additional level of hotel curation to supplement the luxury hotels already present in Capital One Travel, as well as perks, and the ability to be treated like a loyalist even at independent properties that don’t have such programs.Story continues“We are building something that is tailored to our customers,” Knise said, adding that the company gets access to properties in the Premier Collection through technology from Hopper, which powers much of Capital One Travel.More PointsCapital One Travel’s 10x miles for Venture X cardholders compare favorably with 5x membership rewards points from American Express Travel for Platinum cardmembers when they book properties in Amex’s Fine Hotels + Resorts and The Hotel Collection.Chase Ultimate Rewards hands out 5x rewards when Chase Sapphire Preferred cardholders purchase trips.New Airport Lounge ConceptIn addition to the new hotel collection, Capital One plans to open what it calls Capital One Landings in an exclusive partnership with the Chef José Andrés Group, with the first lounge slated to be opened at Reagan National Airport (DCA) in Terminal 2 next year, followed by one at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) Terminal B.The Landing at Reagan National would be 5,483 square feet while the facility at LaGuardia would be 10,700 square feet with tarmac and New York City skyline views.The credit card company opened a Capital One Lounge catering mostly to business travelers at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in 2021, but it believes the Landings concept will be different.Sam Bakhshandehpour, president of the Jose Andres Group, said the Capital One Landing at Reagan National would feature tapas and small, shared plates with Spanish elements, along with global culinary choices.Customers might be business or leisure travelers, families, couples on a honeymoon, or people taking a day trip across the country who want to be home for dinner, he said.Unlike the dining experience at a traditional restaurant, people partaking at the Capital One Landing at Reagan National “don’t have the luxury of time,” Bakhshandehpour said.Capital One is pitching its new lounges as featuring “amazing food and beverages just a short walk from the gate.”Knise of Capital One said the concept of the traditional lounge felt “stale,” usually geared for business travelers. He added that some customers don’t want to sit for hours in an airport lounge, and these spurred new features in both its Lounges and Landings.Bakhshandehpour said details about the Landings in Washington, D.C. and New York are still being worked out with Capital One, and that there will be customization in the respective menus. “The ethos will be the same,” he added.Capital One has two Capital One Lounges on tap to open early next year at Denver International Airport and Dulles International Airport. These new lounges would include grab and go options, as well as designer cocktails, Knise said.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

This third-largest convenience retailer and fifth-largest pizza chain’s self-distribution model, strength in the Inside category and acquisition activities bode well. The same was reflected in first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines grew year over year.Total revenues of $4,454.6 million climbed 40% year over year. Revenues grew across all three categories — Fuel, Grocery &amp; General Merchandise and Prepared Food &amp; Dispensed Beverage. We note that Fuel sales surged 57.4% to $3,096.3 million in the quarter due to an increase of 52.4% in the average retail price per gallon and a jump in the number of gallons sold. Fuel gallons sold jumped 3.3% to 689.5 million due to an increase in the store count.Inside sales comprising Grocery &amp; General Merchandise and Prepared Food &amp; Dispensed Beverage jumped 10.7% to $1,266.6 million in the quarter. Inside same-store sales increased 6.3% compared with an 8% rise registered in the year-ago period. The growth in the metric was driven by prepared food and dispensed beverages, most notably pizza slices, refreshed breakfast menu and cold dispensed beverages. While Grocery &amp; General Merchandise sales advanced 10.5% to $923.1 million, Prepared Food &amp; Dispensed Beverage sales increased 11.4% to $343.6 million in the quarter.Casey's General Stores, Inc.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Vertex Pharmaceuticals.How Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Growth Trending?Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 63%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 44% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.8% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% each year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Vertex Pharmaceuticals' P/E?Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Our examination of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Vertex Pharmaceuticals   you should know about.If P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly and trade on P/E's below 20x.Have feedback on this article?

Click to skip to the very top stocks in this category and see the 5 Robotics Stocks That Will Own the Future.Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA), Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), and Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) are a few of the robotic stocks that are poised to own the future as a wave of automation sweeps across most industries.As labor shortages and increased labor costs continue to challenge companies’ bottom lines, they’re increasingly looking for ways to reduce costs, not to mention costly downtime. Worldwide spending on automation was expected to double between 2020 and 2025, and that’s likely just the tip of the iceberg. Various reports have the industry pegged to grow at close to a 10% CAGR through 2029, topping $400 billion in value by that time.Automation not only reduces costs, but also improves productivity and quality control. McKinsey predicts that automation could boost global productivity by 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points annually, and that automation could effectively replace nearly half of the world’s salaried positions, which pay out $16 trillion in wages annually.The automation sector serves a wide range of industries, a figure which is expected to grow as technologies improve and enhanced sensors and processes become capable of automating tasks that would’ve previously proved challenging.The automotive industry accounts for about 29% of discrete automation demand, with heavy manufacturing and electronics accounting for similar market share. On the process automation side of the coin, the metals and mining industry has major demand for automation solutions, while the healthcare, pulp and paper, oil and gas, and chemicals sectors are becoming increasingly reliant on automation as well.Despite its long-term growth potential, robotics stocks have not fared well in 2022, underperforming even the otherwise lousy broader market. After gaining more than 40% from the end of 2019 through the end of 2021, the Global X Robo Global Robotics &amp; Automation ETF has lost 35% of its value this year, falling back near 2018 levels.Story continuesGiven the economic downturn and the significant upfront costs involved in launching automated solutions, investors are fearful that cash-strapped companies will hold off on making investments in automation. This creates the perfect opportunity for forward-looking investors to buy into a promising industry at rock-bottom prices.In this article, we’ll analyze ten robotics stocks that could make for compelling investments given their standing among some of the leading hedge funds in the world.10 Robotics Stocks That Will Own the FutureUnsplashOur MethodologyThe following robotics stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.10 Robotics Stocks That Will Own the Future10. ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 17 Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA), Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), and Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) are a few of the stocks that the smart money is betting on to lead the robotics revolution. The smart money also likes ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB), which provides automation and electrification-based tools, which figures to be an area of long-term growth.ABB’s Q2 revenue slumped by 2% to $7.25 billion, but that was due to an 8 percentage point hit the company took from the stronger U.S. dollar, as it does business all over the world. Orders were up 20% when discounting the F/X effects, to $8.81 billion, including growing by 33% in the Americas. ABB pays out a quarterly dividend, with its shares currently yielding 2.18%.Hedge fund ownership of ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB) has more than doubled since the end of 2020 and has held firm over the past two quarters even as the stock had started to run up against resistance. D E Shaw initiated a position of 1.88 million shares during Q2, while Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns just over 20 million shares of the firm.Artisan Partners chalked up ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB)’s recent share price slide as being due to broader negative sentiment surrounding industrial companies, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB) is a Swiss-based industrial conglomerate that manufactures electronic products and equipment. There is no new significant fundamental news on the company. We believe the share price decline relates to negative sentiment associated with industrial companies.”9. Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 18 Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) supplies analytics software and automation capabilities to the healthcare space. The company’s inventory management and automation systems can be used by health facilities to store, package, order, and issue medication, while its medication dispensing systems can be used by pharmacies and nurses to automate their workflow processes and reduce human error and waste.Omnicell is predicting $1.4 billion in revenue this year at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would represent a 17% increase year-over-year. Given the company’s $1.25 billion backlog at the end of 2021, that guidance may even be slightly conservative. Given its strong customer retention rate (99%), Omnicell is poised to eventually transition from a product cycle company into one that thrives on higher-margin recurring services revenue.Hedge fund ownership of Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL) hit an all-time high at the end of Q1 before slumping by 31% in Q2. Anita Falicia and James Hillary’s Resolute Capital Asset Partners built a new stake in OMCL during Q1, but then unloaded it during Q2.The Carillon Scout Small Cap Fund likes Omnicell, Inc. (NASDAQ:OMCL)’s suite of healthcare-based automation tools, as revealed in the fund’s Q1 2022 investor letter:“Omnicell (NASDAQ:OMCL) provides an integrated suite of clinical infrastructure and workflow automation solutions for healthcare facilities. Cloud services have been a focus of the company and have shown good growth, automating many manual processes.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 24 Industrial conglomerate Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) develops a wide range of products across various industries, building everything from golf carts, snowmobiles, and baggage tractors, to aerospace technologies and services, and advanced robotic land vehicles. Among the latter list is the firefighting robot Thermite and the M5 RIPSAW combat vehicle.Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s revenue was flat year-over-year in Q2, with the company pulling in $3.2 billion in sales. EPS was up 23% year-over-year to $1.00. Aviation, Industrial, and Finance were the company’s best performing segments during the quarter, growing revenue by between 9.7% and 16.7%. Supply chain issues are expected to impact the company’s ability to make delivers this year, pushing some projected sales into 2023.There was an all-time high in hedge fund ownership of Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of 2021, but the number of money managers long the stock has fallen by 29% in 2022. Gregg Moskowitz’s Interval Partners and Anand Parekh’s Alyeska Investment Management were two of the funds that sold off their TXT stakes during Q2.7. UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 25 UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) supplies end-to-end automation platforms that allow customers to build complex automation processes through the UiPath Studio platform, and utilize machine learning models to further enhance their workflow productivity. The company also develops software robots that can work in tandem with custom-built automated processes to monitor tasks.UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) shares are down 69% this year despite the company posting solid Q2 results. It pulled in $242 million in sales during the quarter, nearly 10% about the company’s guidance, while its adjusted operating loss of $11.2 million was significantly better than the $55 million to $60 million loss the company was anticipating. The company’s annualized renewal run rate also surpassed $1 billion during the quarter for the first time.Hedge funds showed strong interest in UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) following its Q2 2021 IPO, but ownership of the stock tanked during the following quarter and has languished ever since. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has remained the company’s biggest bull since its IPO, owning 37.6 million PATH shares on June 30.6. Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 28 Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) sells automation-based systems, software, and components across a range of industries, including energy, automotive, and food production. Supply chain issues impacted Rockwell’s ability to fulfill orders during its latest fiscal quarter, which has left the company with a record backlog. Yet despite the missed orders, the company still grew sales by double digits during its fiscal Q3. Rockwell also pays out a dividend, with shares currently yielding 1.93%.Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is yet another robotics stock that has fallen out of favor with top money managers in recent quarters, as there were 45% fewer funds long ROK on June 30 as there were two years earlier. Billionaire investing icons Israel Englander and Louis Bacon were some of the money managers who unloaded their stakes in the company during Q2.The Harding Loevner Global Equity Fund is bullish on Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) given the pace of reshoring initiatives in the U.S., which has companies exploring ways to recreate their overseas cost savings through automation. The fund discussed its thoughts on Rockwell’s growth opportunity in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is one such provider, which we purchased during the market correction this quarter. The company—still based in Milwaukee, where it developed its first product, a device to control the speed of electric motors, 120 years ago—has a particular focus on North America. Rockwell’s sales growth had stalled during the US capex recession following the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. The company sold sensors, actuators, valves, and control software, but lacked the ability to weave all these offerings together to provide a single control point for clients wanting to automate an existing plant or build a fully automated new one. Its 2018 minority investment in PTC Inc (NASDAQ:PTC), a Boston-based industrial software firm with a strong capability in augmented reality and visualization tools, marked a turning point in Rockwell’s fortunes. Through this partnership, Rockwell was able to develop software that integrated data from individual business segments, stitching it together on its “FactoryTalk” platform, to give managers a real-time digital picture of their operations. The company is now a chief enabler and beneficiary of reshoring initiatives as a wave of manufacturers scarred by pandemic supply chain disruptions look to automation to help them recreate some of the cost savings that had driven their offshoring in the first place. After hardly growing for seven years, the company saw orders increase 40% in the first quarter over the same period last year and predicted organic sales growth of between 14% and 17%.”Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMBA), Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ:TER), and Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR) are some of the top robotics stocks that the smart money is buying.

These companies tend to have long track records of success and many of them pay out generous dividends that supply investors with a stable source of passive income, making them popular additions to the portfolios of dividend investors.These companies also tend to excel during economic downturns like the one we’re in the midst of now, given that many of them are mature value stocks whose products and services are household staples that can’t be cut from even the tightest of budgets.Just as portfolio diversification can insulate investors from the risk of specific sectors or stocks taking big hits, so too can investing in well diversified companies help insulate investors from the risk that those specific stocks will experience big swings in value one way or the other.

(NYSE:HON) position last year, noting in its Q3 2021 investor letter that it preferred the value proposition offered by other stocks:“The largest exited positions were Oracle, which outperformed significantly, and Texas Instruments and Honeywell, which were roughly flat versus the market in the quarter but were edged out for inclusion by other stocks that became even more attractively valued.”9. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 51 General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has a wide range of segments, including a financial services division, a transportation segment that services the drilling, railroad, and marine industries, among others, as well as segments devoted to aviation, renewable energy, healthcare, oil and gas, and power. GE is set to spin off its healthcare segment in January 2023.General Electric’s orders were up 8% in the first half of the year, including 29% in the aviation segment, but supply chain issues have weighed heavily on its ability to fulfill those orders, which has put the company’s 2022 guidance in jeopardy. GE now expects that $1 billion in projected 2022 free cash flow will be pushed out to 2023, and it may still miss its reduced 2022 FCF projections.

However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 55 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) operates five segments that serve a wide range of industries. Those segments are Healthcare, Industrial, Consumer, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy. 3M has over 100 manufacturing facilities spread across more than 35 countries worldwide. Some of its most well-known consumer products include Scotch tape and Post-it notes.One of many dividend kings that rank highly on the list of most diversified stocks, 3M pays out an annual dividend of $5.94 per share, which currently yields a hefty 5.39%. The stock currently sits at a nine-year low in part due to legal challenges that could see the company hit with billons in losses. If 3M can survive that hurdle, expect the stock to take off.There’s been a 31% surge this year in the number of funds long 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), pushing smart money ownership of the stock near its all-time highs. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns nearly 6.2 million MMM shares worth $802 million as of June 30, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital raised its stake in 3M by 18% during Q2 to 921,930 shares.Mayar Capital bought back into 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) this year, explaining its decision to do so in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.""7. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 While Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is best known for its eponymous oral health and soap brands, the company also sells a wide range of other products, including deodorant, shampoo, fabric softeners, and pet food.Colgate-Palmolive grew organic sales by 9% during Q2, thanks in part to inflation driving the average price of its products up by 8.5%. Inflation negatively impacted the company’s bottom line however, as adjusted earnings fell by 10% year-over-year. The dividend king also raised its dividend payments by 4.4% during Q2, giving its shares a yield of 2.68%.The number of hedge fund shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) topped 60 for the first time in the middle of 2021 and inched up by 12% during Q2 of this year. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies has been a CL shareholder for several years and owns over 4.87 million shares worth $390 million as of June 30.First Eagle Investments Global Fund, which had the largest position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database as of June 30, shared some of the reasons why it likes the stock in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of consumer staples giant Colgate-Palmolive have performed well as investors rotated into more recessionary-resilient defensive stocks amid the broader selloff during the second quarter. The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces. We continue to like Colgate- Palmolive’s dividend and previously announced $5 billion stock buyback program.”6. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 While The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is primarily a beverage giant, it does have a diverse collection of products, including its eponymous soda, as well as Minute Maid, Powerade, Fanta, Sprite, and Dasani, among others. Coca-Cola is also expanding into flavored alcoholic beverages. In certain regions, Coca-Cola also produces and/or distributes several brands that aren’t owned by the company, including Monster Energy, Nestea, and some of Dr. Pepper Snapple’s brands.Coca-Cola grew organic sales by 16% during Q2, while earnings rose by 4% in a challenging environment. The company expects to generate $10.5 billion in free cash flow, with some of that windfall finding its way back to investors in the form of dividend payments, which currently yield 3.14%. The company is also closing in on 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend payments.Hedge fund ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) hit a multi-year high at the end of 2021, but has dipped by 15% this year. Investing legend Warren Buffett remains KO’s staunchest supporter, owning an even 400 million shares worth over $25 billion as of June 30. Buffett has owned a stake in the company since 1988.The ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy bought more shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and other defensive stocks heading into a turbulent 2022, as outlined in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (Coca-Cola). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the favorite diversified companies among hedge funds.

460,404af5b4-6ea0-3943-8bb1-476ae61c75e1,KO,2022-10-19,Analysts Estimate Coca-Cola (KO) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-coca-cola-ko-140102362.html,1666101662,STORY,['KO'],"[The market expects Coca-Cola (KO) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.64 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.5%.Revenues are expected to be $10.6 billion, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.28% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Coke will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.67 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering a surprise of +4.48%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Coke doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

462,6bf95eda-95fe-3a6d-babf-d6e03f7760da,WY,2022-10-19,"Weyerhaeuser: The Major REIT With, Possibly, The Least Amount Of Debt",Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weyerhaeuser-major-reit-possibly-least-194356883.html,1666122236,STORY,['WY'],"[Relative to the amount of shareholder equity, Weyerhaeuser Co. (NYSE: WY) may be among the major real estate investment trusts (REIT) with the least amount of debt. This consideration may be of greater importance as the Federal Reserve takes further actions to increase interest rates. Those REITs with significant debt loads are likely to be more adversely affected by the increases.That’s why Weyerhaeuser stands out as REIT prices have mostly collapsed: If you were a bargain hunter, a “least amount of debt” factor might be of interest. Buyers who search for those types of balance sheet items may find Weyerhaeuser showing up near the top of the list.Here’s what the REIT looks like at Benzinga.com if you search for Weyerhaeuser and click on statistics.Balance SheetThe main thing here is how much the total assets exceed the total liabilities: It’s $17.6 billion to $6.8 billion. That ratio of 2.5 is good in any sector and particularly in the real estate investment trust group of majors. Trading about twice its book value is not bad either, compared to earlier this year when investors were paying three times book.Valuation MeasuresThe main thing here is the price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.51, definitely a low reading relative to the market as a whole. For example, the P/E of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 now sits at 18.07 and the Shiller P/E ratio — the cyclically adjusted PE ratio (CAPE) — is 26.78. Weyerhaeuser begins to look like a value stock of some kind.This year’s funds from operations (FFO) is up by 225% and the past five-year FFO growth rate is 44.9%. The REIT’s price to free cash flow seems decent at 18.17. Weyerhaeuser is paying a dividend yield of 2.44%, not as outrageously high as some REITs but this relatively lower level makes it somewhat less sensitive to the rate hikes.Institutions own 85% of the float and with its average daily volume of 4.1 million shares, it’s liquid enough to attract and maintain their attention.Story continuesThe REIT’s market capitalization of $22.1 billion comes in at less than that of Prologis Inc. at $97.4 billion or American Tower Corp. at $91.7 billion but more than that of Invitation Homes Inc. at $20.35 billion.Weyerhaeuser is on the Raymon James buy list as of late September with a price target of $39. The company was downgraded in mid-September by Bank of America Securities from a buy rating to neutral. The firm lowered its price target for the REIT from $38 to $34. Argus in July had lowered its rating from buy to hold.The daily price chart for Weyerhaeuser looks like this:The stock hit its 2022 low at the end of September and, as October progressed, seemed to have found buyers. That said, it remains an issue that both the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average are trending downward. It will take a substantial rally to turn this chart from bearish-looking to bullish.Here’s how the weekly chart looks:The REIT traded all the way down to its slightly uptrending 200-week moving average and found support. It’s almost as if computer programs had been waiting for that level with buy tickets at the ready. Note that Weyerhaeuser did not drop to anywhere near the March 2020 pandemic scare levels — unlike a few other big REITs that seem to be testing support way down there.Even with the emerging value stock profile for the company and the successful test of weekly price support (so far), new fears about inflation or hikes in interest rates can always have a negative effect.Don't miss:There's No Bear Market For This Real Estate Fund...

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-tell-story-waste-management-120107041.html,1666180867,STORY,['WM'],"[Waste Management, Inc.'s (NYSE:WM) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 31.1x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Waste Management certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Waste Management peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Waste Management.Is There Enough Growth For Waste Management?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Waste Management would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 36% last year. As a result, it also grew EPS by 26% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 12% per year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% each year growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that Waste Management's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Final WordUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that Waste Management maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.There are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for Waste Management that you should be aware of.You might be able to find a better investment than Waste Management.

The facility could support industrial decarbonization and mobility applications in the region and expand clean ammonia exports, helping to increase the supply of lower carbon power internationally.The potential project to be studied is intended to cover the end-to-end energy value chain, utilizing each participant’s technical expertise in production, operational experience, storage, distribution, and export logistics. Collectively, the consortium will bring capabilities and expertise in air separation technology, hydrogen technologies, lower carbon intensity and renewable natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), electrolysis-based technologies, and petrochemicals.Specifically, the consortium will assess the potential for producing hydrogen using natural gas with CCS and renewable hydrogen via electrolysis to supply end-use markets, including the ammonia, petrochemicals, power, and mobility markets.If development proceeds, the project could leverage existing advantages along the Gulf Coast, including pipeline infrastructure, to supply lower carbon and renewable hydrogen to local industrial clusters. Likewise, ammonia infrastructure could support exports to both Europe and the Asia Pacific region.Adam Peters, CEO of Air Liquide North America, said: ""Air Liquide is proud to evaluate, with its customers and industry partners, opportunities to further develop and deploy low-carbon and renewable hydrogen, and carbon capture technologies in the region. The Gulf Coast is the ideal location to model hydrogen and carbon capture technologies as immediate pathways to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. This project exemplifies Air Liquide’s commitment to decarbonizing industrial basins around the world. Prioritizing sustainable technologies, like hydrogen and carbon capture, means we can provide energy transition careers for many thousands of American workers while building a more sustainable energy future for all.""Story continuesAustin Knight, Vice President of Hydrogen, Chevron New Energies, said: ""Across the value chain, collaborations are critical to developing a hydrogen ecosystem, and this is an example of bringing together leaders in the space to explore lower carbon hydrogen opportunities and to contribute complementary expertise. We are seeking to accelerate the deployment of lower carbon solutions and believe companies like Chevron can help bring the capabilities needed to make this a reality. We are excited to be a part of this effort.""Aaron Ledet, Senior Vice President, Olefins and Polyolefins Americas of LyondellBasell, said: ""While our products play an important role in helping to enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions through their use in renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels and electric batteries, we are also taking concrete steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We look forward to collaborating with the members of this consortium to continue evaluating and advancing clean hydrogen as a potential solution for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of our U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing assets.""Marc Merrill, President and CEO of Uniper in North America, said: ""Uniper is very excited to collaborate with this unique group of companies to explore a truly transformative U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen infrastructure project. We look forward to bringing the best of our U.S. business and global technical and commercial platforms to support this effort. Uniper is committed to the green expansion of our Wilhelmshaven LNG receiving terminal in Germany and expects to receive and store roughly 1 MTPA of clean ammonia at the port by the end of the decade. U.S. Gulf Coast supply from this initiative can be critical to meeting that goal.""ABOUT AIR LIQUIDE (U.S.)Air Liquide employs more than 20,000 people in the U.S. in more than 1,300 locations and plant facilities, including a world-class R&amp;D center.

The combination of GE Healthcare’s acute patient monitoring capabilities in the hospital setting, along with AMC Health’s expertise in RPM solutions leveraging an FDA Class II 510(k)-cleared platform with analytics will extend the continuum of non-acute care for patients after being discharged from the hospital.""Pairing AMC Health’s Remote Patient Monitoring suite with GE Healthcare’s clinical monitoring offering will extend care beyond the clinical setting and enable more patients to continue to receive quality care from the comfort of their homes, delivering healthcare without limits,"" said Ashutosh Banerjee, General Manager Diagnostic Cardiology and Remote Patient Monitoring, GE Healthcare. ""AMC Health was selected as our partner due to their established and proven success engaging with patients to measure numerous biometrics in the home to extend the continuum of care.""Nearly half of all Americans, more than 133 million, live with a chronic disease1 and almost a third of the population lives with multiple chronic conditions, contributing to 90 percent of the 4 trillion-dollar annual national health care expenditure2,3. The management of these costly chronic conditions involves monitoring, surveillance and ensuring the patient adheres to their care plan, to avoid deterioration of their condition or unnecessary, costly hospital admissions. Leveraging AMC Health’s RPM platform and data analytics, hospitals, payers, and providers can implement a seamless strategy to coordinate care transitions as well as influence healthy behaviors, and with clinician guidance, also promote self-management of chronic conditions.The companies are collaborating to meet the market need for a scalable RPM solution that applies analytics and risk stratification to identify anticipated patient demand for future services, which could include admissions or readmissions. Coupling AMC Health’s broad suite of solutions and GE Healthcare’s large install base in the US could ultimately bring these RPM solutions to more health care providers and patients.Story continuesAMC Health’s holistic solution allows a clinical team to focus on the whole patient and their unique, often complex health conditions. Utilizing an RPM solution that is tailored to each individual allows for effective treatment, providing patients with access to easy-to-use, convenient monitoring technology outside the hospital walls, while providing near real-time data to their clinician in support of treatment decisions. Home monitoring of biometrics for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, for example, provides the care team with episodic data, providing a more complete picture of the patient’s condition.""We are excited about this collaboration with GE Healthcare,"" said Nesim Bildirici, CEO of AMC Health. ""AMC Health is proud to align with a global leader in healthcare innovation and add our suite of RPM and Virtual Care Solutions to their extensive portfolio of global health system and hospital monitoring solutions.""RPM is complementary to GE Healthcare’s existing hospital-based virtual care environments of Command Center, MURAL Virtual ICU and Digital Central Monitoring Unit which together offer one of the widest ranges of virtual care solutions available. GE Healthcare and AMC Health ultimately aim to collaborate to integrate this hospital data and home data together into the Edison Health database (part of GE Healthcare’s Edison Health platform) so that hospitals can monitor their patients post discharge, from home, as well. It will provide clinicians with longitudinal data for more complete information when decision making related to patient health.About AMC Health:Founded in 2002, AMC Health’s Virtual Care and Remote Patient Monitoring suite of solutions leverages a superior analytics platform and a simple user interface which integrates easily into clinical workflows.

Click to skip ahead and see The 5 Most Diversified Stocks That Hedge Funds Love.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are among the most diversified stocks in the world that the smart money is investing heavily in.While pure play stocks can be a great way to target a specific industry or capitalize on a growing trend, diversified companies offer a level of safety and stability that makes then great long-term investments. These companies tend to have long track records of success and many of them pay out generous dividends that supply investors with a stable source of passive income, making them popular additions to the portfolios of dividend investors.These companies also tend to excel during economic downturns like the one we’re in the midst of now, given that many of them are mature value stocks whose products and services are household staples that can’t be cut from even the tightest of budgets.Just as portfolio diversification can insulate investors from the risk of specific sectors or stocks taking big hits, so too can investing in well diversified companies help insulate investors from the risk that those specific stocks will experience big swings in value one way or the other. Given the level of uncertainty on the market right now, it’s no wonder investors are increasingly turning to diversified stocks to get them through the lean times to come.While even value stocks have struggled in 2022, being down by 13.4% year-to-date according to Morningstar data, they’ve nonetheless outperformed the broader market and thrashed growth stocks, which are down by 36.8% this year. When the market begins to turn the corner, they’ll likewise be the quickest to regain their earlier losses, giving good short- and long-term potential.With that in mind, we checked out the portfolios of some of the best value investors in the world to see which diversified stocks they’re betting on as the economy heads towards a recession and compiled their top picks in this article.Story continuesPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyThe following diversified stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 895 funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q2 2022 reporting period.The 10 Most Diversified Stocks That Hedge Funds Love10. Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 44 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the most popular diversified stocks among hedge funds. Just making the list in tenth is Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON), which services the home building and aviation industries, in addition to providing software, automation, and productivity solutions for a the mining, life sciences, oil and gas, and pulp and paper industries, among others.Honeywell’s backlog is up and the company topped earnings expectations in the second quarter, so it’s performing well despite shares being off by 17% this year. The company expects to grow its organic sales by between 5% and 7% this year. Honeywell has more than doubled its dividend payments over the past decade, and the stock currently yields a solid 2.47%.Hedge fund ownership of Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) dipped by 14% during Q2 and 33% lower than its all-time highs reached during 2018 and 2019. Ric Dillon’s Diamond Hill Capital and D E Shaw each own more than 1 million shares of HON as of June 30.Distillate Capital sold out of its Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) position last year, noting in its Q3 2021 investor letter that it preferred the value proposition offered by other stocks:“The largest exited positions were Oracle, which outperformed significantly, and Texas Instruments and Honeywell, which were roughly flat versus the market in the quarter but were edged out for inclusion by other stocks that became even more attractively valued.”9. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 51 General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) has a wide range of segments, including a financial services division, a transportation segment that services the drilling, railroad, and marine industries, among others, as well as segments devoted to aviation, renewable energy, healthcare, oil and gas, and power. GE is set to spin off its healthcare segment in January 2023.General Electric’s orders were up 8% in the first half of the year, including 29% in the aviation segment, but supply chain issues have weighed heavily on its ability to fulfill those orders, which has put the company’s 2022 guidance in jeopardy. GE now expects that $1 billion in projected 2022 free cash flow will be pushed out to 2023, and it may still miss its reduced 2022 FCF projections. GE pays out an $0.08 quarterly dividend which gives shares an annual yield of 0.50%.Smart money ownership of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) peaked during the first quarter of 2021 but has fallen by 30% since, having declined for four of the past five quarters. Noam Gottesman’s GLG Partners and Edward Eisler’s Eisler Capital sold out of their GE positions during Q2.Longleaf Partners is bullish on General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)’s improved balance sheet as well as the growth potential for its primary businesses, as revealed in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) – Aviation, Healthcare and Power conglomerate GE was punished in the quarter amid top-down economic fears for this collection of seemingly cyclical businesses. However, the market is not giving the company credit for the material improvements CEO Larry Culp has made in his tenure. The balance sheet today is stronger than it has been in a very long time, and each of the three primary business segments each have strong paths to increasing earnings, regardless of the economic environment. Healthcare has historically not been a cyclical business. While Aviation typically has some economic sensitivity, the business still has a strong COVID rebound tailwind that should continue even in an uncertain environment. Power is a less cyclical business, and GE maintains a steady business servicing approximately one-third of the world’s electricity. GE is another example of strong insider buying indicating management’s confidence in the business, while the company also began buying back discounted shares. GE is still on track to break the company into three separate businesses, and we believe this will help the market properly weigh the value of each core segment.”8. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 55 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) operates five segments that serve a wide range of industries. Those segments are Healthcare, Industrial, Consumer, Safety and Graphics, and Electronics and Energy. 3M has over 100 manufacturing facilities spread across more than 35 countries worldwide. Some of its most well-known consumer products include Scotch tape and Post-it notes.One of many dividend kings that rank highly on the list of most diversified stocks, 3M pays out an annual dividend of $5.94 per share, which currently yields a hefty 5.39%. The stock currently sits at a nine-year low in part due to legal challenges that could see the company hit with billons in losses. If 3M can survive that hurdle, expect the stock to take off.There’s been a 31% surge this year in the number of funds long 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), pushing smart money ownership of the stock near its all-time highs. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management owns nearly 6.2 million MMM shares worth $802 million as of June 30, while Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital raised its stake in 3M by 18% during Q2 to 921,930 shares.Mayar Capital bought back into 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) this year, explaining its decision to do so in the fund’s Q2 2022 investor letter:“We also bought back into 3M (NYSE:MMM) as the stock reached attractive levels. We’d sold our shares in 3M last year when the price exceeded our estimated fair value, and as better opportunities to invest in presented themselves at the time. Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.""7. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 57 While Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is best known for its eponymous oral health and soap brands, the company also sells a wide range of other products, including deodorant, shampoo, fabric softeners, and pet food.Colgate-Palmolive grew organic sales by 9% during Q2, thanks in part to inflation driving the average price of its products up by 8.5%. Inflation negatively impacted the company’s bottom line however, as adjusted earnings fell by 10% year-over-year. The dividend king also raised its dividend payments by 4.4% during Q2, giving its shares a yield of 2.68%.The number of hedge fund shareholders of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) topped 60 for the first time in the middle of 2021 and inched up by 12% during Q2 of this year. Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies has been a CL shareholder for several years and owns over 4.87 million shares worth $390 million as of June 30.First Eagle Investments Global Fund, which had the largest position in Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database as of June 30, shared some of the reasons why it likes the stock in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Shares of consumer staples giant Colgate-Palmolive have performed well as investors rotated into more recessionary-resilient defensive stocks amid the broader selloff during the second quarter. The company raised revenue guidance for 2022 but lowered its margin outlook because of higher costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics; we believe that the company’s size and market share provide it with options to mitigate the inflation challenges it faces. We continue to like Colgate- Palmolive’s dividend and previously announced $5 billion stock buyback program.”6. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 While The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is primarily a beverage giant, it does have a diverse collection of products, including its eponymous soda, as well as Minute Maid, Powerade, Fanta, Sprite, and Dasani, among others. Coca-Cola is also expanding into flavored alcoholic beverages. In certain regions, Coca-Cola also produces and/or distributes several brands that aren’t owned by the company, including Monster Energy, Nestea, and some of Dr. Pepper Snapple’s brands.Coca-Cola grew organic sales by 16% during Q2, while earnings rose by 4% in a challenging environment. The company expects to generate $10.5 billion in free cash flow, with some of that windfall finding its way back to investors in the form of dividend payments, which currently yield 3.14%. The company is also closing in on 60 consecutive years of raising its annual dividend payments.Hedge fund ownership of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) hit a multi-year high at the end of 2021, but has dipped by 15% this year. Investing legend Warren Buffett remains KO’s staunchest supporter, owning an even 400 million shares worth over $25 billion as of June 30. Buffett has owned a stake in the company since 1988.The ClearBridge Investments Dividend Strategy bought more shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) and other defensive stocks heading into a turbulent 2022, as outlined in the fund’s Q4 2021 investor letter:“Over the last year, we have repositioned our portfolio to navigate the course we see ahead. We added to more defensive areas of the portfolio like consumer staples (Coca-Cola). While the next month or two will likely prove choppy on account of the Omicron variant, we believe that Omicron, like Delta, represents a speed bump on the way to recovery rather than a true change in course. We see strong economic momentum continuing in 2022 and we expect interest rates to rise. After a decade of remarkably low rates, we would not be surprised if this change in direction is accompanied by some fits and starts in the markets. With our emphasis on pricing power, purposeful sector exposure, valuation discipline, and a strong dividend profile, we believe we are well-positioned for the year ahead.”The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) are some of the favorite diversified companies among hedge funds.

473,f1e1c63d-a250-35e2-abbb-a5364a78725e,GE,2022-10-19,Earnings Preview: General Electric (GE) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-general-electric-ge-140102427.html,1666101662,STORY,['GE'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when General Electric (GE) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis industrial conglomerate is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17.5%.Revenues are expected to be $19.04 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for GE?For GE, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -9.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that GE will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that GE would post earnings of $0.38 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.78, delivering a surprise of +105.26%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.GE doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We expect Apple’s fiscal 2022 revenues to increase 7.3% year over year with Services growing 14.1%..On the flip side, Apple has a growing exposure to the uncertain Chinese market. The company’s services revenue growth is expected to be lower than the June quarter due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable forex.Also, Apple did not provide revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.

If you want to read about some more Jim Cramer stocks, go directly to 5 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now.High growth names at the stock market have been battered in the past few months as rising rates and soaring inflation push investors away from risky bets. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, predicted this turn of events earlier this year. Cramer, who was also at Goldman Sachs during the early part of his career, has recently made the bold claim that finance stocks were replacing tech names as “market leaders” as the Fed was allowing these firms incredible leeway. Cramer said that he thought that the group had the potential to become a leader again, but the banks could never pull it off because the Fed kept rates so low that it was hard for them to make money. However, he underlined that this set of circumstances was changing as the Fed was allowing these companies to make a ton of money. He explained this by saying that banks were paying next to nothing for deposits and then reinvesting that money risk-free in short-term Treasury, whose rates were climbing. Cramer also remarked that unemployment would increase if the central bank takes the federal funds rate close to 5%, which could result in a high number of bad loans for banks. However, the journalist investor noted that banks would be able to offset any damage even though there will be more defaults and delinquencies, but the net interest margin expansion will more than make up for it. Some of the stocks that Cramer has been monitoring lately include Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C). Our MethodologyThese were picked keeping in mind the latest calls that Cramer made on these equities during his appearances on news platform CNBC. An extensive database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the popularity of each stock among hedge funds.Story continues11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy NowBest Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now11. Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32     Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) operates as a pizza company internationally. It is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. On October 12, Cramer placed the firm among a basket of companies whose shares could pop in the coming weeks and months. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $2.2 billion in Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), compared to 27 in the previous quarter worth $1.8 billion.Just like Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is one of the best Jim Cramer stocks to buy now. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, LRT Capital Management, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally (…read more)10. Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32    Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) provides care products and services in the United States and Canada. It is one of the top Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. During the Lightning Round of his show on October 11, the former hedge fund manager outlined his bullish stance on the company. While answering a viewer question about the firm, Cramer said that it was “a good stock to own” in the present macro environment. On October 7, Truist analyst Tobey Sommer initiated coverage of Service Corporation  International (NYSE:SCI) stock with a Buy rating and a $72 price target, citing the company's stable demand stream, recent operational improvements, and excellent track record in the return of shareholder capital. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 32 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $576.5 million in Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI), compared to 29 in the previous quarter worth $357 million.In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Steel City Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Our short position in Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) began to bear fruit when the company reported 2Q’22 results and I think there continues to be room for the shares to fall further. At the company’s analyst day in May, management articulated long-term financial targets that included EPS growth of 8-12%, inclusive of 5-7% from organic activity and another 3-5% from inorganic activity (M&amp;A and greenfield expansion). There are lots of moving variables associated with the outlook, but ultimately, reaching the goal is predicated upon continued strong growth in pre-need cemetery sales (which have favorable revenue recognition conditions). My view is that the recent boom in pre-need activity was a function of 1) a consumer flush with cash and “wealth-effect” driven spending with markets at all-time highs and 2) elevated awareness driven by COVID mortality, and that sooner-or-later the attractiveness of pre-paying $10,000+ for a cemetery plot that you (hopefully) won’t need for many years would become less attractive. When the company reported 2Q results pre-need growth unexpectedly rolled over. As investors come to terms with the fact that SCI is unlikely to deliver on its long-term guidance, shares should continue to retreat.”9. Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34     Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) designs, manufactures, and sells power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products. It is one of the major Jim Cramer stocks to invest in. The former hedge fund manager recently said the firm was among a group of stocks that could pop in the weeks ahead as the bear market comes to an end. On August 8, JPMorgan analyst Mark maintained an Overweight rating on Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) stock and raised the price target to $421 from $415, noting the firm would benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, London-based investment firm Impax Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC), with 846,161 shares worth more than $177 million. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“On a securities level, our top contributors (includes) Generac Holdings Inc. (NYSE:GNRC). All these businesses performed well fundamentally. For Generac, the leading provider of residential standby generators, fundamentals remained strong, but there was little to highlight from the quarter.”8. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) markets tools and storage for industrial users. It is one of the premier Jim Cramer stocks to invest in.

(NYSE:SWK) stock and lowered the price target to $110 from $130, noting that the firm has been at the center of the biggest challenge in the sector in the past five years and that execution on new programs is necessary to drive EPS growth. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, New York-based investment firm Pzena Investment Management is a leading shareholder in Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), with 1 million shares worth more than $141 million. Here is what Saturna Capital has to say about Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:“Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) performed well through the first part of the year but struggled over the summer. China accounts for much of its production, and their zero-tolerance approach to pandemic safety measures has led to disruption, compounded by shipping difficulties and rising materials expenses. We still believe one outcome of the pandemic will be a buoyant home improvement market, given that one never knows when the next pandemic lockdown may occur.”7. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises agricultural commodities, products, and ingredients. It is one of the elite Jim Cramer stocks to invest in.

Here is what the fund said:“Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is a leading agricultural processor that also operates a global nutrition business focused on the development of ingredients and flavors for food and beverages, supplements and more. The company’s recent operating results have benefited (unfortunately) from the war in Ukraine as grain prices and agricultural markets globally experienced strong price increases. ADM is positioned well to benefit from the volatility due to its stable North American agricultural base.”6.

477,4ebec4b4-66d2-3416-b415-89c2c4a817fe,VLO,2022-10-19,Valero Energy (VLO) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-earnings-expected-140102830.html,1666101662,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.90 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +547.5%.Revenues are expected to be $41.79 billion, up 41.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.91% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy?For Valero Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of $9.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $11.36, delivering a surprise of +17.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Valero Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The lower the ratio, the better it is for a health insurer as it indicates a tight rein on costs.However, Chief Financial Officer John Gallina said, ""though the third quarter did come in better than expected, the overall cost structure of the health system is still a bit higher than what it would have been had COVID never occurred.""""The momentum we have across our businesses leaves us well positioned for growth in the coming years. (But) A more severe recession could create challenges.""Elevance said memberships for health plans increased 4.9% to 47.3 million from last year, driven largely by a rise in Medicaid enrollment.The company said it had not seen any impact of uncertain economic environment on its commercial business so far.""For the moment, the operating environment still remains very favorable for managed care companies,"" said Stephens Inc analyst Scott Fidel.Elevance, which was previously known as Anthem, now expects annual adjusted earnings to be higher than $28.95 per share, compared with its prior forecast of more than $28.70 per share.Excluding items, the company reported earnings of $7.53 per share, above analysts' estimates of $7.15, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv.

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now.Large cap stocks in the United States like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are already feeling the heat of an economic downturn as the earnings per share of these businesses register unusual blips in the face of rising interest rates and soaring inflation. However, analysts at top investment advisors in the US have backed these firms to emerge from the crisis better than peers based on the solidity of their business models. For example, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently named Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the most prominent Fortune 500 stocks, as a top pick at the stock market in the event of a macro slowdown. The bullish recommendation has raised eyebrows in the finance world since consumer and enterprise checks deteriorated in the third quarter, suggesting further downside to estimates, with valuation multiples lower but not at troughs. Per Woodring, the electronics giant had greater insulation in this scenario as opposed to competitors. Our MethodologyThe companies that feature on the Fortune 500 list were selected for this analysis. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.12 Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy NowPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on UnsplashBest Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now12. AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55  AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) provides telecommunications, media, and technology services worldwide. It is one of the best large cap stocks to invest in. On September 26, AT&amp;T announced that it had won a task order to modernize networks for the US Customs and Border Protection. The agreement is valued up to $119 million. The firm will update the voice and data networks of Customs Border Protection under the deal.Story continuesOn September 29, investment advisory Barclays maintained an Equal Weight rating on AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) stock and lowered the price target to $18 from $20. Analyst Kannan Venkateshwar issued the ratings update. At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 55 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $1.7 billion in AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 74 in the preceding quarter worth $4 billion. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) is one of the best large cap stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Argosy Investors, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“I purchased shares of AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T) prior to its spin-off of Warner Brothers Discovery (WBD). Most people are probably familiar with AT&amp;T. They are a major cellular service provider, and until recently owner of the Time Warner media assets, which include HBO, CNN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, DC Comics and the Batman content brands, and more. At the time of my purchase, I estimated that the combined T/WBD assets traded at a 15% levered FCF yield, or 6x FCF. I also believe that WBD, which now has HBO Max, has future growth in front of it which was previously in doubt when Discovery was primarily tied to the declining cable television bundle. Since then, Netflix reported disappointing subscriber growth, which threw all streaming companies into disarray. WBD followed that news with a disappointing outlook on its business during its own quarterly earnings.As a result, shares of WBD have declined nearly 40% since the spin-off. WBD now trades for 7x 2023E FCF and there is great potential for returns over the next few years as WBD pays down debt used to finance its merger combining Warner Brothers and Discovery and grows. We do not own a large position in WBD at present, but we may add to it over time.”11. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) engages in the operation of membership warehouses. It is one of the top large cap stocks to invest in. On October 5, the company revealed that its comparable sales in September grew 8.5% and net sales increased 10.1% year-on-year to $21.46 billion.

Also in consumer discretionary, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), which operates a chain of membership-only big-box retail stores, continues to impress as it takes to share and becomes more relevant for the consumer even as the world opens up.”10. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 65  CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) provides health services in the United States. It is one of the premier large cap stocks to invest in.

Here is what the fund said:“Cigna Corporation (NYSE:CI) contributed to performance in the second quarter, outpacing the benchmark Health Care sector return. We believe Cigna benefited from investors seeking relative “safety” in the managed care sector and the stock’s attractive valuation at just over 10 times next year’s earnings. During the quarter, Cigna reported an earnings beat due to a better-than-expected medical loss ratio.”8. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67   Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail, wholesale, and other units worldwide. It is one of the prominent large cap stocks to invest in.

All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour.

Here is what the fund said:“Integrated oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil performed well in the second quarter as continued high prices for energy products supported the stock. As the largest refiner in the US, the company has benefitted from wide “crack spreads,” or the margin between the cost of crude oil and the petroleum products extracted from it. Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019. We are pleased that Exxon has been using its strong cash flows to reduce debt and to return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.”6.

LKQ (LKQ), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Replacement Parts industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this vehicle components company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 8.38%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, LKQ came out with earnings of $1.09 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 per share, representing a surprise of 6.86%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.91 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.89%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor LKQ, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.LKQ has an Earnings ESP of +1.04% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 27, 2022.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

486,bab7ab97-bc58-351d-b368-1d9f957a552f,ADP,2022-10-19,"Calculating The Fair Value Of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-automatic-data-140047649.html,1666101647,STORY,['ADP'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.27bUS$4.56bUS$5.44bUS$5.01bUS$5.31bUS$5.47bUS$5.62bUS$5.76bUS$5.90bUS$6.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.1%Est @ 2.77%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.36%Est @ 2.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$4.5kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$130bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$130b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$68bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$106b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$233, the company appears about fair value at a 8.3% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Automatic Data Processing as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.008. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Automatic Data Processing, there are three pertinent elements you should look at:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

487,9782ba60-7480-3424-858e-059dc7f484da,PG,2022-10-19,Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) 11% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same five-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gambles-nyse-pg-11-120139789.html,1666180899,STORY,['PG'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, long term The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) shareholders have enjoyed a 48% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 39% (not including dividends).Since it's been a strong week for Procter &amp; Gamble shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Procter &amp; Gamble managed to grow its earnings per share at 9.8% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 8% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Procter &amp; Gamble has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Procter &amp; Gamble, it has a TSR of 68% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Procter &amp; Gamble shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 6.6% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 23%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 11% for each year. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance.

It said in September it needs to ""undertake significant work including re-negotiating multiple contracts with service providers that have lapsed, building out necessary infrastructure in Terminal 3 at Havana’s airport where United is being relocated.""Delta has the right to fly 21 weekly flights between the United States and Cuba, made up of 14 for Miami and 7 Atlanta flights.

It houses airlines, railroads, shipping and trucking companies to name a few.Only one S&amp;P 500 transportation company, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL has reported third-quarter 2022 numbers so far. Delta’s revenues of $13,975 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million but increased more than 52% year over year on the back of high air-travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the total operating revenue increase of 11% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.Despite headwinds like inflation-induced market volatility, supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs, which have dented the prospects of the Transportation sector, the sector players have been aided by some positives. Owing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand has been strong despite minor hiccups. This supported growth of transportation players like railroad operators. Following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, people resumed their daily activities and air-travel demand rebounded very strongly. This was a major tailwind for the airline companies in the sector. Even though economies have reopened, consumers’ urge for online shopping remains. This continued strength in e-commerce demand also bodes well.The positivity surrounding the sector is evident from the latest Earnings Preview report, which indicates that stocks in the Transportation sector are expected to report year-over-year growth of 48.4% earnings and 20.6% revenues in third-quarter 2022.Given this encouraging backdrop, let’s discuss three Transportation sector stocks —Alaska Air Group ALK, American Airlines AAL and Union Pacific Corporation UNP, which are scheduled to release their third-quarter 2022 earnings reports on Oct 20.Our quantitative model suggests that the combination of the following two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — increases the odds of a positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.Alaska Air’s results are likely to reflect a continued recovery in air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues. Moreover, its top-line guidance is encouraging. ALK expects total revenues to increase 16-19% from the third quarter of 2019 actuals. The passenger load factor is expected to be in the range of 85-88%.However, high fuel costs are likely to remain an overhang on Alaska Air’s bottom line. The carrier expects its third-quarter economic fuel cost to be in the $3.79-$3.89 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for economic fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $3.81, indicating 85.8% growth year over year.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alaska Air this season as ALK has an Earnings ESP of -0.73% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlaska Air Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlaska Air Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alaska Air Group, Inc. QuoteAmerican Airlines revenues are likely to have been aided by buoyant air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues. Moreover, AAL’s bullish top-line guidance is also encouraging. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2022 are anticipated to be roughly 10-12%, higher than the level recorded in third-quarter 2019. Management expects TRASM to be 20-24% higher than third-quarter 2019 actuals.On the flip side, an increase in oil prices continues to remain an overhang on AAL’s bottom line. The fuel cost per gallon in third-quarter 2022 is expected in the $3.73-$3.78 band.Our proven model does not conclusively predict a beat for American Airlines this earnings season as AAL has an Earnings ESP of -1.79% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. At the time, the third-quarter earnings preview article was issued, AAL had an Earnings ESP of -12.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.American Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. QuoteStrong freight demand is expected to have boosted Union Pacific’s freight revenues in the third quarter. On the flip side, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to rising fuel prices, remain an overhang on Union Pacific’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel price per gallon consumed is pegged at $4.09, indicating growth of 72.5% from the year-ago reported figure.Despite high fuel price concerns, our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Union Pacific this earnings season as UNP has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.Earlier, the third-quarter earnings preview article showed that Union Pacific was unlikely to beat on earnings this quarter.

501,1a69b7c8-a521-36cd-9773-ea67a05c421a,AAL,2022-10-19,JetBlue Airways (JBLU) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblue-airways-jblu-reports-next-140102329.html,1666101662,STORY,"['JBLU', 'AAL']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when JetBlue Airways (JBLU) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +300%.Revenues are expected to be $2.56 billion, up 29.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 86.96% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for JetBlue?For JetBlue, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.67%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that JetBlue will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that JetBlue would post a loss of $0.11 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.47, delivering a surprise of -327.27%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.JetBlue appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, American Airlines (AAL) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share for the quarter ended September 2022.

However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.79%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Airlines will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

She wanted to find a position that was inspiring and enriching-in other words, one with purpose.""I asked myself if I was doing what I was passionate about,"" says Sharma, who is senior director of human resources for Principal® Global Services in India.That search prompted what's become a lifelong journey of self-discovery and reinvention, defined by resilience in the face of change and challenge.Leaning into strengthsBorn in New Delhi, Sharma's describes her parents as supportive of her aspirations even as they faced a life of hardships. When she reached school age, they decided to send her to a convent school. ""Because my parents were both self-made, they wanted to ensure they could give us the best education, so we'd never face the struggles they faced,"" Sharma says. ""Their lives and humility have guided my choices, my behavior, and what kind of leader I am.""But learning would prove far more difficult than anyone realized: Sharma, struggling with unkind classmates and a limited social circle, also had dyscalculia (a learning difficulty related to processing numbers) and partial dyslexia. At that time both were undiagnosed and little understood. ""What came naturally to other students, I had to put 100 times more effort into doing well,"" she says.She relied on techniques like visual cues and flash acronyms. ""It taught me skills like perceptiveness, observation, and inclusion,"" Sharma says. ""The experience made me realize I could help and uplift others with similar challenges.""""While we are segregated with borders and countries, human emotions are universal, and you can learn so much from accepting differences."" - Jaya Sharma, senior director of human resources, Principal Global Services, IndiaPost-college, Sharma began her career in outsourcing. ""I got the opportunity to travel and work with diverse cultures,"" she says. ""It really furthered my belief that, while we are segregated with borders and countries, human emotions are universal, and you can learn so much from accepting differences.""Story continuesValue for everyoneUnable to pursue an advanced degree but interested in human resources, Sharma learned on the job through training, certifications, and roles with diversity and depth. ""I wanted to figure out how to add value to an organization and make a difference for every person aspiring to be their best version and lead others,"" she says. ""How do you make leadership development and learning engaging, versus just teaching to the level of high potential talent or the fastest student?""In 2018, Sharma put her more than two-decade-long career on pause; both her parents had died, and she took time to reset her personal life. ""When I was young, I wondered about struggles, but in hindsight I realized they prepare us for even bigger life situations of adversity, fear, loss, grief,"" Sharma says. ""As a leader, this adds empathy, character, depth, and heart.""Once Sharma started exploring a workforce re-entry, she connected with a professional at Principal who recommended a possible human resources role. ""During my interviews, the leaders were transparent with me about what they wanted to build, and that they wanted someone coming in with diversity of experience,"" she says.A future-ready focusSharma joined Principal in February 2021; she's responsible for the human resources journey-acquisition, development, management-and business partnership in India.One of her goals was to make a difference. Part of that, she well knows, is investing in and developing leaders of tomorrow. ""Building strong leadership makes us future ready, so we're looking at how we can continue to train internal talent to move beyond their roles, collaborate, and add depth,"" Sharma says. ""We must invest time and pay it forward, so I try to do that now by helping emerging talent build their capabilities and pursue their aspirations.""Sharma's career has already had multiple phases. But the same persistence she learned in school keeps her focused on her goal: Leave things better than you found them.""When I came back to work, it was bigger than personal aspiration. It was about creating, building, and transforming, and Principal brought that opportunity to me,"" she says. ""Our differences strengthen us, and each one of us at Principal plays a part in building a respectful, inclusive, authentic world.""Read more: ​A high school retreat changed chief technology officer Kathy Kay's life.Bringing her whole self to the table guides Erlin Kakkanad at work and home.Åsa Norrie defines success by the smart, motivated people on her team.Veteran Julie O'Hara-Harvey puts her life's experience to work helping other employees connect.Toya Pollard understands how little decisions make a big impact.Insurance products and plan administrative services provided through Principal Life Insurance Company®, a member of the Principal Financial Group®, Des Moines, IA 50392.© 2022 Principal Financial Services, Inc.​​​Principal®, Principal Financial Group®, and Principal and the logomark design are registered trademarks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., a Principal Financial Group company, in the United States and are trademarks and service marks of Principal Financial Services, Inc., in various countries around the world.2433595-092022Principal Financial Group, Tuesday, October 18, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Principal Financial Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Principal Financial GroupWebsite: https://www.principal.com/about-us/corporate-citizenshipEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Principal Financial GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720821/Jaya-Sharma-Our-Differences-Strengthen-Us]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Aflac (AFL) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share 13 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 31, 2022.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.22 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Aflac has an Earnings ESP of 0.74%.AFL is one of just a large database of Finance stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Northwest Bancshares (NWBI).Slated to report earnings on October 24, 2022, Northwest Bancshares holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.30 a share six days from its next quarterly update.For Northwest Bancshares, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 is 1.7%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AFL and NWBI could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Hawaii Water has been providing necessary services to these customers since 2018 under an operation and maintenance contract.The acquisition entails Hawaii Water to  provide direct services to customers and make necessary investments to upgrade the wastewater infrastructure. It will also help Hawaii Water to take necessary measures to provide reliable services to customers.California Water Service has been expanding operations through systematic acquisitions. In 2021, its units completed four acquisitions, which added 585 water and 3,000 wastewater connections. Recently, its unit Washington Water Service received approval to acquire the water assets of Stroh’s Water Company.Consolidation to Aid Water IndustryPer the Environmental Protection Agency, at present, more than 51,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are providing water solutions to customers. A large number of small operators in the industry do not have the financial ability to make costly repairs to water mains and wastewater lines. As a consequence, essential upgrades and repairs to infrastructure get delayed.Per the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, water main breaks occur every two minutes in the United States due to the aging of the existing water infrastructure. The breaks in the pipeline result in the wastage of 6 billion gallons of potable water each day and add to the loss of water utility operators.To stop the wastage of priceless resources, consolidation of smaller operators with larger utilities is quite essential. This will lead to more financial capabilities and expertise to provide reliable services to customers.Story continuesUtilities Continue to ConsolidateWater utilities like American Water Works AWK, SJW Group SJW and Essential Utilities WTRG, among others in the water utility space, are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.American Water Works continues to focus on the acquisition of utilities that provide services to 5,000-50,000 customers. Through nine buyouts, the company added 51,000 customers to its existing customer base. Its pending acquisitions (as of Jun 30, 2022), when completed, will add another 29,200 customers to its base. Its long-term (three to five-year) earnings growth is currently pegged at 8.08%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Water Works 's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 4.5% and 8.8%, respectively. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, it closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to the existing customer base. This has been the fourth Texas acquisition by SJW Group in the past 12 months. In the next five years, the company plans to invest $1.5 billion to further strengthen its infrastructure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for SJW Group's 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15.3% and 9%, respectively. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3.In the six years ended Dec 31, 2021, Essential Utilities expanded utility operations by completing many water and wastewater acquisitions, which, in turn, added 94,000 customers. In the first quarter of 2022, the company completed one buyout, which added 11,000 customers. It plans to invest $3 billion from 2022 through 2024 to fortify operations and efficiently serve its expanding customer base.Essential Utilities’ long-term earnings growth is currently pegged at 6.2%.

Our estimate for the quarter is $1.67.The consensus mark for consolidated copper sales for the third quarter is pegged at 1,027 million pounds, which suggests a year-over-year decline of 0.6%. Our estimate for the quarter is 1,020 million pounds.A Few Factors to WatchFreeport’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect the impacts of weaker copper prices. Copper had a stellar run in 2021, thanks to a strong rebound in industrial demand from the pandemic-led downturn and supply constraints. The widely-used industrial metal witnessed a roughly 25% surge in 2021. The momentum continued in the first quarter of 2022.However, copper prices have lost the momentum since the second quarter. The uncertainties surrounding the global economy and new coronavirus restrictions in China dwindled demand for the red metal, hurting prices. Copper prices headed south from late April after hitting an all-time high in March 2022 driven by concerns over supply-chain disruptions, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a spike in energy costs and low global inventories.The impacts of lower average realized copper prices are likely to reflect on Freeport’s September quarter results. The company is also likely to have witnessed sequentially higher unit net cash costs in the quarter partly due to higher energy prices.Weaker gold prices are also likely to have affected the company’s performance in the third quarter. Higher yields, interest rate hikes and a stronger U.S. dollar weighed on gold prices.Meanwhile, the ramp-up of underground mining at PT Freeport Indonesia and efforts to increase operating rates at Cerro Verde and El Abra mines are likely to have aided the company’s copper volumes in the quarter to be reported. The company is expected to have benefited from higher mining rates in South America.Story continues FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price and EPS Surprise FreeportMcMoRan Inc.

510,c1d7e3fd-9484-3744-8d4b-ed706c48782f,PEP,2022-10-19,10 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-food-stocks-buy-135105565.html,1666101065,STORY,"['HSY', 'SYY', 'GIS', 'SPTN', 'UNFI', 'DAR', 'MDLZ', 'PEP']","[In this article we present the list of 10 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Food Stocks to Buy Now.The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are a few of the food stocks that hedge funds are investing billions of dollars into.Food stocks are among the safest havens for investors during economic downturns like the one we’re experiencing, as they are the most essential consumer staple there is. No matter how much people are struggling financially, they have to buy food to eat.That’s been borne out during the current inflationary period, as food sales volumes have been essentially flat despite food prices skyrocketing by more than 10% year-to-date. In the United States, inflation jumped by 9.1% year-over-year in June, with the food index rising by 1% month-over-month. That followed a 1.2% escalation in food prices during May.In Canada, food prices have experienced the fourth-highest level of inflation among product groupings tracked by Statistics Canada, rising by 9.8% year-over-year through August. That trailed only the transportation, energy, and nondurable goods categories in terms of yearly inflation.That sales volumes are flat even as prices have shot up during a challenging economic environment highlights not only the obvious necessity of food in our daily lives, but also some of the innovations and initiatives that are spurring global food sales. Among them is the shift to healthier and more natural meals, snacks and ingredients, which carry a premium price tag. The healthy snacks category has enjoyed close to 20% sales growth over the past two years.Another trend that is benefiting some of the packaged goods and snack food companies on this list is the consumer shift from eating full meals to so-called grazing instead, otherwise known as snacking or eating quick ready-made products. With consumers trying to rein in their grocery bills, preparing costlier full-scale meals and making trips to the restaurant are being bypassed in favor of quicker and cheaper alternatives.Story continuesA quick look at stock performance shows the divergent paths that restaurant stocks and food stocks are on, as the AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF has sank by 22% this year, while the Invesco Dynamic Food &amp; Beverage ETF (with the great PBJ ticker) is down by just 4.5%, greatly outperforming the broader market.With that in mind, let’s take a look at the best food stocks to invest in now according to a collection of some of the savviest investors on the planet.10 Best Food Stocks to Buy NowOur MethodologyThe following food stocks are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment.

512,0c74c0dd-a186-3a57-9575-959f468fdfcf,PEP,2022-10-19,"Boasting A 51% Return On Equity, Is PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-51-return-equity-pepsico-120026329.html,1666094426,STORY,['PEP'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), by way of a worked example.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for PepsiCo is:51% = US$9.8b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.51 in profit.Does PepsiCo Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, PepsiCo has a superior ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for PepsiCo.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining PepsiCo's Debt And Its 51% Return On EquityPepsiCo clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.05. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Union Pacific's current trading price of US$202 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Union Pacific’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Union Pacific What Is Union Pacific Worth?Great news for investors – Union Pacific is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $274.52, but it is currently trading at US$202 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. What’s more interesting is that, Union Pacific’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Union Pacific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Union Pacific's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 21%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since UNP is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UNP for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UNP. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

It houses airlines, railroads, shipping and trucking companies to name a few.Only one S&amp;P 500 transportation company, namely Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL has reported third-quarter 2022 numbers so far. Delta’s revenues of $13,975 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million but increased more than 52% year over year on the back of high air-travel demand. The buoyant air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the total operating revenue increase of 11% from third-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels.Despite headwinds like inflation-induced market volatility, supply-chain woes and high-fuel costs, which have dented the prospects of the Transportation sector, the sector players have been aided by some positives. Owing to the uptick in economic activities, freight demand has been strong despite minor hiccups. This supported growth of transportation players like railroad operators. Following the relaxation of COVID-related restrictions, people resumed their daily activities and air-travel demand rebounded very strongly. This was a major tailwind for the airline companies in the sector. Even though economies have reopened, consumers’ urge for online shopping remains. This continued strength in e-commerce demand also bodes well.The positivity surrounding the sector is evident from the latest Earnings Preview report, which indicates that stocks in the Transportation sector are expected to report year-over-year growth of 48.4% earnings and 20.6% revenues in third-quarter 2022.Given this encouraging backdrop, let’s discuss three Transportation sector stocks —Alaska Air Group ALK, American Airlines AAL and Union Pacific Corporation UNP, which are scheduled to release their third-quarter 2022 earnings reports on Oct 20.Our quantitative model suggests that the combination of the following two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — increases the odds of a positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Story continuesYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.Alaska Air’s results are likely to reflect a continued recovery in air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues. Moreover, its top-line guidance is encouraging. ALK expects total revenues to increase 16-19% from the third quarter of 2019 actuals. The passenger load factor is expected to be in the range of 85-88%.However, high fuel costs are likely to remain an overhang on Alaska Air’s bottom line. The carrier expects its third-quarter economic fuel cost to be in the $3.79-$3.89 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for economic fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $3.81, indicating 85.8% growth year over year.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alaska Air this season as ALK has an Earnings ESP of -0.73% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlaska Air Group, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAlaska Air Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alaska Air Group, Inc.

Total revenues in the third quarter of 2022 are anticipated to be roughly 10-12%, higher than the level recorded in third-quarter 2019. Management expects TRASM to be 20-24% higher than third-quarter 2019 actuals.On the flip side, an increase in oil prices continues to remain an overhang on AAL’s bottom line.

519,f7df536b-a660-3691-ac85-21d47e1dc614,AMP,2022-10-19,Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-expected-140102849.html,1666101662,STORY,['AMP'],"[Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 25. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1%.Revenues are expected to be $3.45 billion, down 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.48% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameriprise?For Ameriprise, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Ameriprise will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ameriprise would post earnings of $5.73 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.81, delivering a surprise of +1.40%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ameriprise appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

520,5752ce82-273f-34da-a511-40a762a08c44,CSCO,2022-10-19,Farm to Flame Energy: How Bio-Generators Provide Clean Energy to Off-Grid Communities,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farm-flame-energy-bio-generators-130000319.html,1666098000,STORY,['CSCO'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 18, 2022 / Now that the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge 2022 winners have been officially announced, you'll want to learn more about each winning team and the story behind each innovation. The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 startups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.In response to the growing urgency to reverse climate change, we introduced five new Climate Impact and Regeneration prizes totaling $300,000 USD. These prizes recognize solutions that can reduce or remove greenhouse gas (GHG) from the environment or regenerate depleted ecosystems.Farm to Flame Energy is a Climate Impact &amp; Regeneration Prize Runner-Up, winning $50,000 USD. Based out of the U.S., they are building electricity generators that use biomass waste as fuel. I recently sat down with Stefano Alva, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Farm to Flame Energy, who has a background in energy science, technology, and policy. He shared more about his team's innovative solution.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve?Stefano: To solve the problem of energy poverty. Seven hundred million people worldwide still lack access to a reliable electricity grid. This lack of access means they have to find other ways of getting electricity. And unfortunately, the most popular and convenient solution for those who live off the grid is a diesel generator. So, diesel generators are expensive, and they're polluting. In Nigeria, they're causing 1,500 deaths per year due to the fumes these diesel generators create. It's a big problem, and it most often impacts underserved communities.Story continuesCan you explain how the solution works?Stefano: We developed a bio-generator engineered to produce off-grid energy. We transform mixed-wood debris, landscaping waste, and agriculture residues into a carbon-rich powder that we combust to produce high-thermal efficiency heat. High-thermal efficiency heat means we can extract a lot of the energy within the biomass. We then use the heat to create steam and run an alternator and a steam generation unit. Where the innovation lies is in our ability to use mixed biomass waste to produce smokeless and odorless heat from it.We're partnering with a greenhouse in New Jersey, Think and Grow Farms, to pilot our bio-generator, enabling them to stop using fossil fuel and be able to source their power directly from our unit. Think and Grow Farms supports a lot of local farmers and teaches them skills on how to move away from traditional farming and how to learn vertical farming, which is more profitable. Ideally, Think and Grow Farms will be off the grid within one year, and using alternative energy will contribute to their commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?Stefano: When people think about renewable energy, they think about solutions like solar and wind power, which are excellent solutions that I'm supportive of using. The issue is that they've created this intermittency gap which means that when solar and wind energy are produced, the power is not constant. It works for certain scenarios, but for people that need to run their businesses 24/7, this solution does not fit their needs.A way to overcome this intermittency gap is to, for example, have batteries. However, introducing batteries to achieve 24-hour power becomes extremely expensive, 3 to 4 times what it costs to get their electricity from the grid. What sets us apart from other renewable solutions is the ability to provide 24/7 affordable and renewable energy that is also reliable.What inspired you to develop this solution?Stefano: Farm to Flame Energy was founded by Will McKnight, Chief Revenue Officier (CRO), and Kwaku Jyamfi, CEO. They met at Syracuse University and decided to commercialize a unique combustion process patented by Will's grandfather, James McKnight. I met Kwaku at Carnegie Mellon University and was recruited to join the team. We were all working at Carnegie Mellon's Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship, which helped us get our first-generation unit, which is a 280-watt unit that was able to light a couple of lightbulbs.I was born in Costa Rica, which is my personal inspiration because it is a green country focused on renewables. One hundred percent of their energy comes from renewables, and I grew up with a naive understanding that the world was moving in this direction.When I moved to the United States, it was clear to me that there was so much more work to be done and that I could put forward my effort and dedication to giving a little bit of Costa Rica to the rest of the world. And beyond that, I think the best gift you can give someone is access to electricity.There are all these off-grid communities worldwide, and accessing electricity is the first step to accessing other necessities like healthcare, sanitation, better jobs, and education. Accessing electricity can completely change a person's life and the future that their families can have.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Stefano: Right now, we are in the process of testing our first commercial unit. This prize will help us test out this commercial unit successfully and open the door for us to deploy more units in the future. We're grateful for this award because it came at a crucial point where we have our first client that is ready and happy and excited about seeing our technology deployed, and the funds will help us serve that client and prove those client benefits.Do you know what you will use the prize money for specifically?Stefano: It will be used to move our generation unit from our manufacturing facility into the client space. We will also use some of the funds to acquire the necessary equipment and hire someone to operate the machinery and test it out. We need this testing to secure certifications that prove that our technology is up to the required electricity generation standards.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Stefano: There's a bit of a misconception that you have to follow the money in the startup world. I would encourage people to rethink that and follow the impact instead. The rest will come if you can develop technology that improves people's lives and the environment.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720824/Farm-to-Flame-Energy-How-Bio-Generators-Provide-Clean-Energy-to-Off-Grid-Communities]"
