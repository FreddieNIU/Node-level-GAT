SWSCX holds a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance."", 'Objective', 'SWSCX is part of the Small Cap Growth category, and this segment boasts an array of many other possible options. Small Cap Growth mutual funds usually focus their portfolios on stocks with large growth opportunities and a market cap of under $2 billion. These portfolios tend to feature small companies in up-and-coming industries and markets.', 'History of Fund/Manager', ""Schwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SWSCX. Schwab Small-Cap Equity made its debut in June of 2003, and since then, SWSCX has accumulated about $482.28 million in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager."", 'Performance', 'Obviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund in particular has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 7.92%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 6.54%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWSCX over the past three years is 20.25% compared to the category average of 20.58%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 23.68% compared to the category average of 23.48%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""With a 5-year beta of 1.13, the fund is likely to be more volatile than the market average. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&P 500. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -6.61. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns."", 'Holdings', 'Examining the equity holdings of a mutual fund is also a valuable exercise. This can show us how the manager is applying their stated methodology, as well as if there are any inherent biases in their approach. For this particular fund, the focus is largely on equities that are traded in the United States.', 'This fund is currently holding about 97.36% in stocks, and these companies have an average market capitalization of $3.02 billion. The fund has the heaviest exposure to the following market sectors:', 'Finance', 'Industrial Cyclical', 'Other', 'Technology', 'Turnover is about 43%, so those in charge of the fund make fewer trades than comparable funds.', 'Expenses', 'For investors, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is key, since costs are increasingly important for mutual fund investing. Competition is heating up in this space, and a lower cost product will likely outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, all things being equal. In terms of fees, SWSCX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.09% compared to the category average of 1.01%. So, SWSCX is actually more expensive than its peers from a cost perspective.', 'While the minimum initial investment for the product is $0, investors should also note that there is no minimum for each subsequent investment.', 'Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.', 'Bottom Line', 'Overall, even with its comparatively similar performance, average downside risk, and higher fees, Schwab Small-Cap Equity ( SWSCX ) has a neutral Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and therefore looks a somewhat average choice for investors right now.', 'For additional information on the Small Cap Growth area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Best Golden Visa Programs in 2024.', ""Immigration, as a response to various economic and geopolitical challenges, has been on the rise in recent years. While these issues are indeed significant enough to prompt movement across countries, the contemporary pursuit of obtaining citizenship is also motivated, to some extent, by investment opportunities. Given that the world's wealthy possess the financial resources to invest, countries have a strong incentive to attract them. The influx of foreign direct investment into a country is bound to provide a boost to its economy. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that numerous programs offering either permanent residency or citizenship have emerged over the years, aptly dubbed as 'Golden Visas'."", 'To check out the best citizenship by investment programs, read our article 13 Countries with the Best Citizenship by Investment Program in the World.', ""The significance of these programs is evident from the substantial revenue they have generated for host countries. According to the 2022 report by COMPAS (Center on Migration, Policy & Society), investments through residency-by-investment programs resulted in a €20 billion influx of funds through 2019. Prior to the onset of Covid-19, these 'Golden Visas' were generating €3 billion annually. Major recipients included the UK, Spain, Portugal, and Greece. Since then, the market for such programs has continued to expand. While conducting a macroeconomic analysis of these programs as a proportion of GDP may not yield meaningful results due to their relatively small scale compared to larger economies, examining their impact within the context of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can provide valuable insights. For instance, some residency-by-investment programs, like those in Portugal and Greece, have contributed 10% to 15% of their FDI over the years."", 'It is therefore not surprising that the Immigration Consulting Services Market has not only experienced growth in previous years but is also poised for further expansion. The market, valued at US $1.42 billion in 2022, is projected to reach $2.11 billion by 2029, with a forecasted Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 5.73% over the period from 2023 to 2029. Consultancies are actively sought for various immigration pathways, including work, study, investment options, and more.', 'Investment abroad, whether through direct investment or via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks, has become increasingly common. Many US companies, attracted by tax incentives and lower labor and manufacturing costs, have expanded their investments overseas, particularly in Europe. This has resulted in a significant shift from $580 billion in investments in 1982 to an astonishing $6.4 trillion today. Similarly, individuals, particularly wealthy ones, are drawn to various tax advantages and are increasingly participating in Golden Visa programs. These programs not only provide access to lucrative markets but also offer pathways to permanent residency and, ultimately, citizenship. Their investments extend beyond real estate and donations to include stocks and ETFs.', ""Firms such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) play a crucial role in assisting individuals seeking investment management services abroad. For instance, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE: SCHW) offers guidance on identifying international ETFs and mutual funds to diversify portfolios. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation's (NYSE: SCHW) 2023 ETFs and Beyond Study, which surveyed 2,200 investors, there is a growing preference for ETFs. The study revealed that 95% of current ETF investors are planning to increase their ETF holdings in the future."", 'Similarly, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) is among the leading financial firms that consistently enhance their ETF offerings, providing investors with a competitive range of international investment options. This ensures the creation of diversified and profitable portfolios. Here’s what Carillon Eagle Growth & Income Fund had to say about the performance of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:', '“PNC Financial and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) performed well due to more benign inflation data, which the market likely interpreted as a sign that a recession is now less likely to occur. Recall that historically speaking, banks are hyper-cyclical stocks and typically will trade lower if investors foresee a recession, because recessions tend to trigger loan losses.”', 'To compile our list of the 15 Best Golden Visa Programs in 2024, we extensively research various sources to identify available programs. We evaluate each program based on its minimum cost and time to permanent residency, ranking them according to the lowest cost and shortest time period. We assign a weighted average to these metrics, with a higher weight (0.6) given to cost and a lower weight (0.4) to time. The list is then presented in descending order of weighted-averaged rankings.', 'Note: We exclude programs that do not lead to permanent residency or citizenship.', 'The values in currency are subject to change depending on the current exchange rate.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Gains from its Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, and robust digital and DTC performances are expected to have been other tailwinds.Continued strength in retail traffic trends within NIKE Direct has been boosting conversion rates. The strong member buying trends are likely to have led to a record digital performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Strength in the North America, EMEA and APLA regions, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value, is likely to have aided sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The NIKE Direct business has been benefiting from robust growth across regions and an efficient digital ecosystem, which comprises its online site, and commercial and activity apps. Revenues at NIKE-owned stores are expected to have gained from improved traffic, higher conversion rates and growth in average order value. The NIKE Direct business is likely to have benefited from growth in North America, EMEA and APLA, offset by continued weakness in Greater China in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect total NIKE Brand revenues to increase 1.5% year over year to $11,748.2 million in the fiscal third quarter, driven by a 0.8% rise in the Wholesale business.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management stated that it expects strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost management to offset soft second-half revenues and drive earnings growth.However, NKE has been witnessing a decline in the gross and operating margins due to rising costs, higher markdowns, increased freight and logistic costs, elevated input costs, and currency headwinds. Also, elevated SG&A expenses are concerning.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, the company predicted 160-180 bps improvement in the gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by gains in strategic pricing, improved markdowns and lower ocean freight rates.We expect gross profit to increase 3.2% year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2024, with a 160-bps expansion in the gross margin to 44.9%.NIKE has been witnessing elevated SG&A expenses, driven by increased demand-creation expenses due to the normalization of sporting activities and overhead costs related to higher wages. Demand-creation expenses are likely to have increased in the fiscal third quarter, owing to elevated marketing and advertising investments. These investments are likely to have supported significant global sports moments and product launches, and investment in capabilities to transform NIKE's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness.Operating overhead expenses are expected to have resulted from higher wage-related expenses and NIKE Direct costs, as well as increased technology investments to support digital transformation in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect demand-creation expenses to increase 9.6% year over year and operating overheads to rise 2.1% year over year in the fiscal third quarter.Driven by the gross margin growth offset by higher SG&A expenses, our model suggests a 20-bps expansion in the operating margin to 11.6% in the fiscal third quarter."", 'Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for NIKE this time around.

If you want to skip our overview of the global biotechnology industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks To Invest In.', ""Biotechnology is the riskiest and fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry. The sector is typically made of firms that use biological ingredients to make their products, and since this requires vast amounts of investments, biotechnology stocks are among some of the riskiest that you're likely to find on the stock market. Naturally, this means that their performance as a category depends on investor risk appetite, and individual headwinds and tailwinds carry the potential of high volatility and significant upswings and downswings."", 'For instance, while most media attention is focused on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Bitcoin, and perhaps rightly so due to sizeable tailwinds enjoyed by both in the form of potential demand for artificial intelligence products and global acceptance, biotechnology stocks have been quietly ticking along in the background. As an example, consider the shares of Vincerx Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:VINC), Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRBP), and Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX).', 'These biotechnology stocks belong to different categories of the stock market in terms of market capitalization. They range from micro caps (stocks with a market capitalization lower than $300 million) in the case of Vincerx, to mid caps like Viking Therapeutics. However, despite this, all three biotechnology stocks have delivered triple digit share price appreciation this year. NASDAQ:VINC, NASDAQ:CRBP, and NASDAQ:VKTX are up by 446%, 134%, and 267% year to date, showing that the right biotechnology stocks are no less than artificial intelligence stocks when it comes to rewarding investors for their shrewdness.', ""Digging deeper into their share price performance to see what tailwinds end up benefiting biotechnology stock prices, let's take a closer look at Viking Therapeutics. Just like NVIDIA's GPUs and their usage for artificial intelligence workloads have got investors rushing in hand over fist in the technology and semiconductor segments of the stock market, in the world of pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks, it's weight loss drugs that are causing all the hype. For Viking, the catalyst came just as February was ending after the firm revealed that patients part of a trial of its weight loss drug had ended up losing nearly 15% of their weight. This placed Viking right alongside pharma giants the likes of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) when it comes to targeting America's need for weight loss treatments - which some believe see as much as $33 billion in annual spending."", ""However, analyzing just one stock is unlikely to provide an accurate picture of how biotechnology stocks are faring as a category. For this, we have to look at the performance of either stock indexes made of such equities or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide investors the ability to invest in sectors instead of firms to narrow down the volatility faced by individual stocks. On this front, one such index that is well known is the NASDAQ Biotechnology PR USD (NASDAQ:NBI) biotechnology stock index. Our hypothesis at the start of this piece was that category wise, biotech stocks are among the riskiest on the market due to large capital expenditures and long product timelines, and looking at the NASDAQ Biotechnology stock index, it dropped 11% in the 24 months of 2022 and 2023. This era was marked by a rapid interest rate hike and high inflation - both of which aren't good for firms that rely on large amounts of capital and costly inputs for their business operations. Yet, as the investment climate starts to become rosier this year, the index gained 3% until February end before reversing the trend."", ""Finally, before we head into our list of the most profitable biotechnology stocks, it's also important to see what the hedge funds are saying. For Polen Capital, while its fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter did affirm confidence in the weight loss giant Novo Nordisk, it was the third quarter letter that dived into the rationale of the investment decision:"", 'Regarding Novo Nordisk, we’ve covered the company for a long time and owned it many years ago, ultimately selling because of payor pricing pressure on the insulin business. What has changed the investment case for us, though, is the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs, which not only help diabetics control blood- sugar levels but have also shown significant efficacy in weight loss. Novo Nordisk’s best-known GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic (for diabetes) and Wegovy (for obesity), are already blockbusters, frequently grabbing headlines in global news publications for their significant results. GLP-1 drugs account for nearly 70% of Novo Nordisk’s sales today.', ""So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable biotechnology stocks to invest in. A couple of notable picks are Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.', 'Number of Q4 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 76 ', 'Latest TTM Net Income: $4.8 billion ', ""AbbVie Inc.

We're excited to discuss our fourth quarter performance, which greatly exceeded our top line expectations. We achieved gross originations of $67.5 million, representing growth of 13% year over year. Revenue of $56.7 million, which represented 16% growth and just below breakeven adjusted EBITDA. Not only did we record our second highest quarter for gross originations volume ever. We also delivered double digit revenue growth and positive adjusted EBITDA that improved by $4.9 million year over year. Today, my comments will focus on the drivers of our outperformance during the fourth quarter, progress on our merchant and customer strategies and a brief update on our tech position. And finally, I'll give you a brief overview of our top focus areas for 2024 and the initiatives we intend to prioritize to drive growth this year. I'll then turn the call over to Nancy, who will provide you with more insights on our fourth quarter financial performance, our outlook for performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2024. And what we're seeing in the macro environment and our competitive landscape so far, this year.Before I jump into Q4 performance, I want to take a quick step back and reflect on the very strong year we've had First, we delivered strong gross originations and revenue growth during the period in which most of our competitors saw their business contracts. This underscores our belief that we are not only offering the right product to the market, but we are offering a highly differentiated for both merchants and consumers. Second, we changed the trajectory of our path forward by significantly enhancing Katapult pay during 2023. Katapult pay accounted for approximately 19% of our total gross originations in 2023, and we are very excited about the future of this game-changing applications.Finally, we accomplished all this within the rigor of our disciplined expense strategy, which allows us to improve adjusted EBITDA substantially as we grew the top line. We are proud of the strong year we had and of our future potential, neither of which would be possible without the hard work of our counterparty. I am so grateful for their contributions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I want to thank them for their dedication to ours.With that backdrop, let's talk about our strong performance during the quarter. As we entered the fourth quarter, we believe the uncertain macro environment could have an impact on our core non-prime consumer. Whilst inflation has come down, student loan repayments had resumed saving or rates were low and credit card balances were high grading and uncertain macro environment. Despite this, we saw strong and steady growth in gross originations during the fourth quarter. And importantly, gross originations volume growth was achieved during the year in which our dynamic underwriting model risk and controls led to an approval rate that was more than 400 basis points below our 2022 approval rate. This strength was driven by originations coming from our direct integrations as well as Katapult within our direct channel. We believe we benefited from merchant advertising and discounting, which we leveraged in our own marketing campaigns, driving better than expected increase in demand. This strength extended across our core retail categories included automotive, electronics, furniture and tires. In addition, we benefited from performance of new direct merchants such as grown brilliant and exotic PC Katapult pay was an important driver as well. During the quarter. First, customers continued to leverage the feature to originate new leases with more than 20 merchants that were available in our marketplace heading into the fourth quarter.Second, this was a big driver of our performance. We added Walmart to our Katapult pay marketplace sooner than we anticipated. We saw a very robust response from our customers, and approximately 6% of the leases that originated in the fourth quarter were durable goods from Walmart. We believe this demonstrated our ability to drive demand by offering merchants, our customers that our customers really want, and we are one step closer to transforming Katapult into a true shopping destination. Overall, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our direct integration capabilities and Katapult pay. Our goal is to leverage both these channels to grow our merchant base and overall consumer reach.Let's now dive into the progress we've made executing our merchant strategy, which are rooted in three key areas, one, growing gross originations by integrating with new merchants to growing our market share with our anchor merchants and three offering, ensuring that we offer the variety of durable goods, our customers are looking to drive sustainable customer demand.I'll start with a few updates on direct integration. We are very pleased with the quality of the merchants that we've integrated during the quarter to highlight a few merchants. First, Lenovo, while we've had the relationship with Lenovo since 2017, they opted to pursue a waterfall only process in 2021. Since that time, we worked with them to demonstrate that having a direct LTL option as well as the waterfall process filled a meaningful gap for consumers. As a result, we've added Lenovo back as a direct merchant during the fourth quarter. They are already supporting us with marketing on their financing page, which includes Katapult as their only LTL options.We also launched grown brilliant during the quarter. As we announced in November last year, customers have been embracing the brand and we are excited to have them onboard during the engagement season. While some of you may not be familiar with exotic PC, they are a PC company that craft custom PCs and laptops for creators, gamers and professionals stay integrated our LTL option in the fourth quarter. And so far our customers have been very engaged with their goods.And finally, we also kicked off a direct relationship with MediMAR, one of the most trusted names in medical equipment nationwide. Medimar has both online presence as well as brick-and-mortar stores, and we're excited to recognize them as one of our top 25 merchants during the fourth quarter. Beyond our fourth quarter success stories, we believe we have a robust pipeline of direct integration opportunities that we can continue to steadily convert throughout 2024. But bringing on new direct merchants is only one part of our merchant growth strategy. We are focused on leveraging ways in which we can deepen relationships with merchants that are already on our platform. And we've successfully done it with Lenovo and are working with other merchant market Katapult on their website and to get Katapult into the lead position versus other LTL operators. In addition, we're exploring new ways to leverage our data to help our merchants with their marketing efforts. For example, we are piloting ways in which we can share the lease amount that a customer has been preapproved to spend with our merchants while protecting the data privacy of our of our consumers. We believe we can allow merchants to create a more targeted marketing effort to drive conversion. We have already seen these types of initiatives worked well with our largest merchant partner, Wayfair throughout 2023, we completed multiple rounds of testing to better understand how it can enhance the parts of our customer journey. We directly control within the Wayfair's checkout flow. Our focus was on making sure we are doing a good job educating our consumers about our product and trying to ensure, for example, that customers fully understand pricing and terms and in an effort to remove friction, increased transparency and make their customer journey and even better experience our hard work with Wayfair paid off in 2023.For the full year, we grew waste. Our gross originations by 5.6%, which was faster than Wayfair's US sales growth for the book growth for the full year indicating we are continuing to take share with this important merchant partner during 2023, applications for Wayfair leases grew by more than four 5% and further same-day take rate increased by approximately 210 basis points in 2023 and overall take rate expanded by 450 basis points during our fourth quarter. However, we saw some softness in our Wayfair gross originations and they are down slightly compared to 2022. We believe this softness was driven by a few factors, including seasonality. While furniture sales have not been historically a driver of Q4 holiday performance for us, we were able to improve our wafer business across several key measures. Same day. Take rate at Wayfair grew 340 basis points in the fourth quarter and their overall take rate grew 370 basis points, which we believe shows that customers who receive at least software from us are engaged and ready to convert and that our efforts to provide customers with even more transparency on their lease on their lease terms are bearing. There is one more positive result that I'd like to highlight within our furniture category, excluding Wayfair, gross originations grew 30% in the fourth quarter. This was driven in large part by the success we're seeing we're seeing with one-stop veterans, which we launched as a direct merchant in December 2022. Since then, we've also added a key user feature key user features, such as a price calculator, which allow our customers to not only see the full price for the durable goods. They are viewing, but also their weekly monthly, et cetera. Payments would be if they use the LTO product. This tool also shows customers pricing should they choose to exercise an early purchase option. This has had a meaningful impact on volumes in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with our traction in the furniture category generally and with our Wayfair partnerships, specifically, Wayfair and Katapult have mutually a mutually valued partnership. And we're working hard to grow together by improving marketing and take rate while enhancing the technology behind our products to deliver an even better customer journey.As we look out into 2024, we believe we can leverage the lessons we learned from tailoring our product to fit the needs of Wayfair and its customers to drive growth again this year. And equally as important, we can take these lessons and continue to deploy them across the rest of our merchant base to drive growth, complement the work we are doing with our merchants. We are also focused on attracting new customers and enhancing our product experience. So that we can capture more wallet share from our existing customers. I'll talk about how we're doing this in a moment. But bottom line is our strategy is working during 2020 2023, total application volume grew 13% and we approved more than 600,000 new leases. This translated into about a 23% increase in the number of lease originations, approximately 15% growth in new customers. And as of December 31st, 2023, we had approximately 19% more active customers than we did at the same time in 2022. At the same time, we continue to offer an experience that our customers love resulting in fourth quarter customer repeat rate of almost 60%, which is an all-time high for us and with an NPS score of 52 as of December 31st. We feel confident these data points underscore. We are delivering a lease-to-own product that meet the needs of our customers across the EU.So how are we doing? As we've already talked about how a robust portfolio of directly integrated merchants is driving customer demand and how this is this is a steady part of our business that we expect to continue to grow. But let's also talk about Katapult pets, Katapult pay as a feature in our app that leverages our virtual credit card technology, which is fueled by our proprietary AI and machine learning that allow us to determine what is leasable and what is not this unique capability allows us to use Katapult conveniently shop for more than 20 merchants from a marketplace like our direct integrations. Katapult pay is a great business driver for merchants. It gives them access to new non-prime customer customer population who, if not far at least to own solution, might not have had the financial resources to purchase their durable goods. But unlike our direct integration Katapult pay allows us to onboard new merchants like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy Home Depot and Target, among others without requiring merchants to invest into direct integrations. In addition, Katapult pay has allowed us to create the consumer journey that starts in the Katapult mobile app. This means that consumers can start their transaction with Katapult specifically, and we have more visibility into our customers' shopping habits and more control over our destiny. Currently, it's a tool that our existing customers are using most so we can envision a future where Katapult pay becomes a low cost customer acquisition channel. Our confidence is driven by several data points from improvement. First, Katapult pay has become a trusted channel for customers to start a lease with us as of December 31st, more than 15% of our current leases were initiated through Katapult that second, this strong usage led to December being the best month ever for Katapult has nearly $10 million in gross originations came through the feature during the month and $20 million in gross originations came through Katapult pay for the fourth quarter, representing 30% of our total originations for the quarter.For the full year 2023, $42 million of gross originations were generated through Katapult, third, 14% of the leases that were initiated through Katapult were from actually brand new customers in 2023. And finally, our app itself has become a terrific engagement tool and is the most used channel for our customers to access their lease information. In December, 63% of customer interactions with Katapult began in the app, whether through Katapult pay merchant or a directly integrated merchant. These interactions started in our app. We ended 2023 with more than 500,000 app downloads, up from roughly 125,000 downloads in 2022. And we also had more than 200,000 unique users interact with the In short, we believe our app has created a customer experience that sets us apart from the competitive landscape. In addition to catapult pay. We'll continue to do a lot of testing and learning within marketing during the fourth quarter, similar to similar to catapult pay. We believe marketing can help us drive customer demand, independent of and in concert with our merchant throughout 2023, we put the structure and resources in place to allow us to begin scaling and marketing strategy focused on ROI, positive consumer acquisition and reactivation. We grew our communication volumes significantly with a 500% increase in the number of emails We sent and the addition of SMS and push notification capability as we increased our touch points with consumers. We also saw our open rate and click rates increase, and we believe this indicates that our marketing campaigns are resonating while we are being very prudent with our marketing spend. We continue to believe that our opportunity to build our market share within the underserved LTO under industry is considerable. We will continue to test and learn entire marketing investment.District ROI. department has a summary about our opportunity to grow our customer base. We feel good about the strong ecosystem we've built we have direct merchant partners that deliver a steady stream of new and repeat customers. Katapult pay is an important contributor to our strong repeat customer rate and has potential to blossom into a reliable, low-cost consumer acquisition channel. And finally, we have an emerging market strategy that can prudently scale to amplify growth from both of these channels over time. All this progress we're making is supported by the fundamental strength of our technology platform from our seamless direct integrations that get a decision back to a customer in the end, an average of five seconds or less through our underwriting algorithms that use personal information and a customer has top of mind to our ability to autonomously onboard new merchants into Katapult pay to testing and learning we're doing within our marketing strength. All of this progress sits on the bedrock of our technology. We believe that our direct LTO option and Katapult pay are creating sustainable competitive advantage that will help support our continued growth and keep us at the forefront of technology in our industry.In addition, our tech advantage has been built upon low cost, lean, nimble tech infrastructure that allows us to move quickly to scale new solutions and capitalize on growth opportunities that require tech ingenuity. For example, Katapult pay is powered by proprietary models that determine if a durable goods is leasable. These models allow us to onboard retailers like Wal-Mart, which has a broad spectrum of products available for purchase, including many that are not eligible for an LTO transaction. Given the breadth and depth of their SKUs without these technology-driven models, it would be very difficult if not impossible to bring market-leading retailers like like this to our customer.Looking across our competitive landscape, we believe our technology is unique and cutting it. Last quarter, we talked a bit about generative AI and our opportunities to deploy it within our tech stack. We are excited to launch our first use case of generative AI in the fourth quarter to help us automate address validation. We created this tool to address the friction some customers were experiencing. If there are minor differences in their addresses they provided and what was listed in the merchant database. We can now use generative AR to quickly address what was previously a manual process to update eliminating a source of customer frustration. Beyond this, we're exploring ways to integrate generative AI. further and Katapult pay marketing and other areas before I turn it over to Nancy, I want to provide a few thoughts on our focus areas for 2024. On the customer front, we understand that our customers are deal seekers, which is why we continue to focus on offering the best and transparent pricing and passing those savings onto our customers. We believe we offer the lowest pricing in the industry and will remain focused on giving our customers the value they need and the experience they deserve. As you know, by now, our application process is the best in our competitive landscape we make it easy for the customers to apply. We don't require bank account information, a lengthy credit history, and we never charged late fees ever. So in 2024, we expect to see our strategy continue to reflect our commitment to delivering value while fostering long-term customer relationships. This approach not only sets us apart in the market, it also drives better performance for our business and significantly increases our retention rate. We are also dedicating effort to making it easier for customers to shop with us. We think the that enhancing the customer shopping journey in our marketplace is another way we can control our destiny and help drive demand. One big area we're exploring as product base research for broad product base search right now customers have to start their searches at the retail level, and we believe we can create options that consumers for consumers to shop directly for the actual durable goods. They'd like to lease, we can make their experiences even better. In turn. This will help us better understand where the customer is in their journey. And while they're shopping for what they're shopping for and eventually unlock unlock our ability to do more targeted marketing.Regarding Katapult pay, we are very pleased with the adoption rate and customer engagements in 2024. We'll be exploring opportunities to both bring our new merchants that our customers want and further personalize the user experience with the aim of increasing conversion to round up our customer focus in 2024, we believe we are well positioned to grow our customer base. There are multiple levers we believe we can pull, including continuing to execute our ROI, focused marketing strategy, build out our other customer referral channels, including strategic partnerships and sustaining high customer repeat rates. Within our marketing strategy, we will continue to focus on making sure our customers can use our market-leading LTO product to shop for all the durable goods they want and need. This means for focus on onboarding Direct Merchants that can help round out our shopping experience. We believe that our high repeat rate is a hallmark of a loyal and engaged customer base and will continue to look for ways to sustain this differentiator, which is compelling piece of our merchant value proposition in 2024. We'll continue to look for opportunities to leverage our unique platform to solve merchant problems, opening up new growth channels for both Katapult and our merchant partners. We will also continue to look for opportunities to build new merchant referral pipelines such as the one we created in 2023 with Synchrony. And finally, we will also be looking at opportunities to further leverage our technology and proprietary data to grow our business.First, our technology and data insights will continue to be fundamental drivers of the customer and merchant focus areas I've outlined.Second, we want to look for ways that we can extend our data lead by integrating new resources that will allow us to capture even more underwriting and fraud signals that allow us to offer more leases to underserved customers.Well, I won't go into too many specifics today, while from a big picture perspective, we are also exploring ways to leverage these competitive advantages to better monetize our growing customer base and create new revenue streams.With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our fourth quarter results. Nancy."", 'Nancy Walsh', ""Thank you, Orlando. I'm excited to talk to you today about our strong fourth quarter results, which have added to our track record of growth for five consecutive quarters. We have grown our gross originations year over year. In the fourth quarter, our revenue growth was 16.1%, which accelerated from the revenue growth rate we achieved in the third quarter. We also reduced our write-offs as a percentage of revenue. And with our focus on disciplined expense management, we delivered a $4.9 million year-over-year improvement to adjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter.With that as context, let me provide you with some financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Before I discuss the rest of our P&L, I wanted to mention that we made out of period adjustments to correct immaterial errors related to cost of revenues and rental revenue in our P & Ls. This also impacted property held for lease and sales tax payable on our balance on our balance sheet. It will also be a $1.2 million cash impact associated with sales tax payable we have reflected these out-of-period adjustments in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation table in our press release. For your reference, the revenue write-offs as a percentage of revenue and adjusted EBITDA data that I'm about to present and also reflect these adjustments. As I mentioned, we have now grown gross originations for five consecutive quarters. And as Orlando touched upon, our fourth quarter results came in significantly better than what we were expecting. Gross originations increased 13% to $67.5 million for our performance was driven by strength with our existing merchants and our ability to onboard Walmart into Katapult pay during the fourth quarter sooner than we expected. New and existing customers engage with Wal-Mart through Katapult paid during the quarter, resulting in higher than expected gross originations. In addition to this driver, we also saw strong performance during the Cyber five period of the holiday season. Gross originations during this period grew double digits compared with the same period of 2022. Katapult pay was a key driver of this growth. For the full year 2023, we achieved gross originations of $226.6 million, up approximately 15%. While this headline number is a result, we are very proud of our business, excluding Wayfair, grew even faster during 2023, excluding Wayfair gross originations grew nearly 28% through.While we are very pleased with our partnership with Wayfair, we are also pleased with our progress toward diversifying our sources of gross originations and revenue for 2023, non Wayfair gross originations were 48% of our base, up from 43% in 2022. We believe this demonstrates that we can continue to leverage Wayfair to drive growth even as we diversify our gross originations base.During the quarter, 59.9% of our originations came from existing customers this is an all-time high for us and we believe this reflects our obsession with striving to give our customers the best experience we can at all time for the full year 54.2% of our originations came from existing customers. As we have discussed, we are continuing to see a large number of repeat customers come back to us through Katapult pay. In fact, those customers who generate at least through Katapult pay in their first second or third, approximately 29% of the time these customers will generate another lease within 60 days. We continue to believe that engagement with the app and our targeted marketing efforts are helping us drive our very strong repeat customer growth rate.Q4 revenue increased 16.1% to $56.7 million, exceeding the 13% to 15% growth outlook we provided last quarter. This performance reflects the trends driving gross originations, the volume performance we saw in the first three quarters of the year and strong collection efforts. Full year 2023 revenue grew by 5% compared with 2022 write-offs as a percent of lease revenue continued to improve and remained within our 8% to 10% target range. For the fourth quarter, this metric was 9.6%, 10 basis points lower compared with 9.7% in Q4 2022.Moving on to profitability. Our disciplined approach to expense management, coupled with our top line growth, allowed us to deliver another quarter of substantial adjusted EBITDA growth. As a reminder, late in 2022, we instituted a number of cost savings measures, and we are now at the tail end of anniversarying these benefits.Our fourth quarter total operating expenses were impacted by a $7 million net expense we reported in connection with our negotiations to settle the two class action lawsuits had been pending in New York and Delaware since 2021 and 2022, respectively. This may be satisfied with the combination of cash and shares. In addition, we have recorded a $5 million receivable for our insurance policy payments. In total, we recorded a $12 million liability in connection with the potential settlement. I should note that we have not yet and may not reach a settlement for these parties on these terms or at all further, any settlement agreement is subject to court approval by the Delaware and New York courts, although the settlement negotiations are ongoing and not final. Given the status of settlement talks are required under GAAP to accrue for the potential settlement, we will provide additional updates as appropriate in the future.During the fourth quarter, our total operating expenses increased by 14.5%, primarily driven by the $7 million net one-time estimated litigation settlement expense. Excluding this expense, total OpEx for Q4 would have decreased by 27.8% year over year. For the full year, we reduced our total operating expenses by 8.5% year over year and excluding the one-time estimated litigation settlement expense, full year 2023 OpEx have decreased by 19%, excluding underwriting fees and servicing costs, which are variable. The one-time expenses related to our estimated legal settlements and depreciation and non-cash stock compensation expense.Our fixed cash operating expenses were $8.5 million, down 35.6% compared to last year. Based on our top line performance and the structural and sustainable benefits we are realizing from our operating efficiencies, we were able to improve our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA performance for the fourth consecutive quarter. For the fourth quarter, we reported just below breakeven adjusted EBITDA, an increase of $4.9 million compared to the $5 million loss we reported in the fourth quarter of last year. As a reminder, expenses related to our estimated legal settlement are an add-back to our adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023. Our adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $1.9 million, excluding approximately $1.8 million for immaterial out-of-period adjustments, we delivered adjusted EBITDA that was slightly below breakeven. This means that we delivered approximately $16.6 million more in adjusted EBITDA compared to full year 2022. As of December first, 2023, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $28.8 million, which includes $7.4 million of restricted cash. We also had $60.7 million of credit facility debt during the fourth quarter. We identified an issue with our third party lease verification vendor. This issue live to catapult over funding $9.6 million in leases during the fourth quarter. That should have been funded by our lending partners. This meant that our cash use should have been about $9.6 million lower during the quarter, and our debt should have been $9.6 million higher we corrected the issue in early 2020 for recovered the cash and normalized our cash and debt levels on an adjusted basis. Excluding this issue, we would have ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $38.4 million, which includes $7.4 million of restricted cash. We would also have reflected $70.4 million in outstanding debt on our credit facility on an adjusted basis. Let me explain the issue in more detail. We have a third party lease verification vendor that verifies and then approves the new leases to be included in our borrowing base in December 2023. This vendor had a timing area and timing error in their validation processes. This created a situation where a number of new leases each day were not validated and therefore were not added to our borrowing base. This in turn led to a funding these specific leases at 100% with our own cash instead of at 10%, which is our normal practice. Our credit facility provides a 90% advance rate for funding each valid lease. This issue only impacted Q4. And as I mentioned, we have already received the cash from the underfunding. In addition, once we alerted our lease verification vendor together, we implemented enhanced controls and processes to prevent this from occurring in the future. We are continuing to navigate an evolving macro environment. While inflation remains stable, it is still having an impact on the spending habits and budgets of our core target consumers. Us retail traffic is down. Interest rates while stable remain elevated, saving rates are low and credit card usage is high currently and it's unclear what impact these dynamics will have on prime lending standards and how they will affect the US consumers' access to credit. We continue to believe that we have a large addressable market of underserved non-prime consumers. And it's important to note that lease-to-own solution have historically benefited when prime credit options become less available based on these dynamics and the operating plan in place for the full year 2024. We expect the following for the first quarter year-over-year our gross origination growth, that is about flat compared with the first quarter of 2023, a 12% to 14% year-over-year increase in revenue, meaningful improvement in our adjusted EBITDA performance compared with the first quarter of last year, reflecting our revenue growth expectation and a sustained reduction in fixed cash operating expense. Fixed cash operating expenses are expected to be down approximately 15% year over year in the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we will anniversary the cost reduction activities we put in place last year and see a full year benefit in Q1 2024 versus only a partial benefit in Q1 2023 for full year 2020. For All, we expect continue to expand our customer base and acquire new customers.Another year of gross originations growth. For the full year, we expect gross originations to grow at a rate of at least 10%, and our first quarter performance should be the low point for the fourth for the year, we also expect gross originations to improve sequentially in the second half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2024, driven by growth in direct merchant originations and originations coming through Katapult.Our outlook does not include any material impact from prime creditors tightening or loosening of buffers, and it assumes that the macro environment does not change SIGNIFICANT. We also expect to maintain strong credit quality in our portfolio. This will be driven by ongoing enhancements to our risk modeling, onboarding, high quality new merchants through direct integrations and repeat customer, engaging with Katapult pay revenue growth is expected to be 10% at least 10%.Finally, and with the continued execution of our disciplined expense strategy, combined with our growing top line, we expect to deliver another year of adjusted EBITDA growth. We also expect adjusted EBITDA to follow the seasonal patterns that we have seen historically. We delivered strong results during 2023, and we believe we are positioning the Company for sustainable and profitable growth. We have multiple levers that we can pull to drive both gross originations and revenue. And we have built a lean infrastructure that does not require significant investments for continued growth. Our strategy is clear, and we believe our focus on providing our customers with the best-in-class LTO experience where terms are transparent and fair and our approach is human and compassion will allow us to build market share and continue to expand the business. We are very proud of our 2023 performance and with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Josh Sigler, Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Josh Siegler', ""Yes, hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nice to see the strong gross originations this quarter. I would first wanted to touch on your guidance. So your guidance implies, you know, acceleration in originations as we progress through 2024. So to that end, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on your merchant pipeline and if you expect that acceleration to really be driven by new merchant adds or deepening penetration with existing merchants?Thanks, Josh, thanks for the question. Yes, our merchant pipeline continues to be robust on. We're looking at we're having more meaningful conversations. Obviously, with the retail environment, especially in January being what it was obviously bringing incremental customers to these merchants is becoming more and more important. And some of the issues that we had in the past, like shipping constraints and things like that have gone away. So I would say we're in more of a normal operating standpoint with our merchants. But the issue with the merchants is really getting through their tech stack and getting the integration completed. So we expect that some of the growth is going to come from new merchants that we've already identified in the pipeline and but that most of the growth is coming from the growth in Katapult pay as well as our current merchants and really continuing to do what we've done with Wayfair with our other merchants to grow to grow that.Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you. And then you know, I wanted to talk a little bit about reinvestment so as we're progressing through 2024, how are you thinking about allocating incremental dollars towards either to catapult pay up for your more traditional, you know, lease-to-own model, they're integrated into the company's website or in store."", 'Nancy Walsh', ""So we continue to evaluate all investments based on the return that it's going to provide and deploying those investments where we think it will have the biggest and quickest impact, whether that be continuing our marketing testing, whether that means continuing to invest in our technology. All of those are things that we're incorporating into the plan, but really using on the return on investment as our basis for what we do and how quickly and we do have a scalable, low cost tech stack that really gives us an advantage to be able to not have to make huge investments to continue to drive the business forward."", 'Orlando Zayas', ""And Josh, it's Orlando. I'll add one of the things that we see Katapult pay is a strong customer performance and so from a returns perspective. And so obviously that we want to continue to grow that business. That doesn't mean we're not going to focus on direct. We really wanted to do both. And we think that we'll put investment dollars where we think it's important, but what's going to bring us the best return now."", 'Josh Siegler', 'That makes sense. Thank you.', 'Operator', 'Anthony Chukumba, Loop Capital Markets.', 'Anthony Chukumba', ""Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong end to the year as well. I guess my first question, I was just a little confused. I thought you had preannounced your revenues and the revenue number that I saw today was, I mean, unless unless I'm going crazy, which is entirely possible was different from what I saw in your preannouncement. So I was just wondering if you can reconcile that."", 'Nancy Walsh', ""Hi, Anthony. It's Nancy. Thank you for the question. You are absolutely correct. We did preannounce 19% as a result of those one-time out of period adjustments we needed to make that impacted revenue as we indicated, and that's purely the difference between what we preannounced and what we announced today, but still very pleased overall with not only the gross origination growth, but the revenue growth and with our continued outlook into 2024."", 'Anthony Chukumba', ""Okay. Great to hear that I'm not crazy. I'm calculating. Okay. Second thing.So obviously, business, some CMPB. with a reduction in late fees on credit cards. Would love your thoughts in terms of first off, do you think that there's going to be litigation. I mean, are you building into your guidance at all? And I guess most importantly, if let's just say that, that it holds up and late fees do get reduced like what would be the impact on you, if any saying?"", 'Derek Medlin', ""Yes, hi, Anthony. This is this is Derek. I'll take that question. So what we see in terms of those changes to what's happening in the credit stack upon us with prime credit cards and near prime credit cards and other financial products is that and at a time that there's a reduction in there financial returns that that could create opportunity for us in terms and the change in their underwriting criteria and change of their approval rates. So there is a potential there. However, we have not built that into any of our planning. In general. What we see is that consumers are savvy. They're looking for financial products and payment plans that are very transparent to them that they can understand the total cost. And so we take all of these insights and learnings as to what's happening and we implement them into our stance in terms of how we serve our customers. And we think we stand up well in terms of being very transparent and clear. And in general, we'll have to see how this all settles out.The last thing I'd say though, is that consumer partnerships in the prime space and we have certainly heightened as different credit providers are looking for ways to increase their overall approval rate by having a wonderful partnership with someone like Katapult. So we saw that last year with different partnerships that we already announced. And we think that there's continued interest in partnering with Katapult to improve the overall our options are for merging."", 'Orlando Zayas', ""And Anthony, this Orlando, thanks for the question. I just want to reiterate, we don't and we haven't for a number of years, we don't charge late fees. And so we're pretty proud of that because we're trying to work with our customers and they see that as advantage. And that helps our repeat rate, but we're kind of ahead of the curve from a regulatory perspective if they start going down to at least done."", 'Anthony Chukumba', ""Right? Yes, I was I was worried you guys in charge late fees. I was just thinking more about the and the impact on the guys a view on that, but that's the.That's helpful. And then I guess I guess just my last question, I just wanted to make sure I heard that Walmart number correctly. You said Walmart accounted for 6% of your fourth quarter. Was that total leases that gross originations was what was that number?"", 'Orlando Zayas', 'Exactly.', 'Nancy Walsh', ""It's total leases, not the gross originations.Total leases."", 'Anthony Chukumba', 'Got it. Okay. Well, I mean that is a very impressive number.', 'Orlando Zayas', ""I mean, when exactly in the quarter you on-board them six weeks before Cyber five. We had expected. The tech team was trying to get it done before CyberArk. They're anticipating any I don't have the Cyber five, they exceeded expectations, got it done right before Cyber five. And so really it's about six weeks worth of business in the fourth. And we were very, very happily surprised at the response of fire."", 'Anthony Chukumba', ""Okay. And our last one last thing, because I am a boomer Cyber five. We're talking about the week before Thanksgiving right there."", 'Orlando Zayas', ""But yes, that's the Thanksgiving, the five days starting, thanks, Friday, Thursday, Friday, going through Cyber Monday, I got it."", 'Anthony Chukumba', ""You learn something new every day when you're above one, if that's okay."", 'Nancy Walsh', 'Thank you.', 'Orlando Zayas', 'Thanks for your question.', 'Operator', 'There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO, Orlando Zayas for closing comments.', 'Orlando Zayas', ""Thanks, operator. I just wanted to reiterate how proud I am of our team. We had a great year. We delivered top line growth during a time when our competitors declined. We grew while adhering to our disciplined expense management philosophy. We believe we are well positioned to build on the success of 2023, and we are looking forward to extending our track record of growth this year to everyone listening.Thank you very much for tuning in to hear about the progress we've made over the past year. We are proving our ability to grow while providing our customers with fair, transparent and accessible lease to own products and our merchants with a growth channel that has much potential. Thank you again for your support and the interest in our story."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.""]"

This piece combines Ai video, Ai photo, 3D CGI, 2D VFX, Motion graphics, 35mm film, digital video and advances in Ai voiceover. Every current Ai tool was explored and pushed to the maximum."" [I have left ""AI"" as ""Ai"" throughout.]', 'Seen on its own, the ad is not in itself objectionable. Live footage is intercut with 3D models, landscapes and abstract scenes, all rendered in contrasty monochrome.', 'Walker claimed that the whole thing was done in three weeks flat, which is quite short for a major brand and athlete, and noted of the reliance on AI that ""Key in this industry shift is that we stay true to the core of what we’re here to do - tell powerful stories and uplift the human soul with beautiful, provocative and interesting visions...Ai will integrate into our workflows in ever evolving ways … but the heart and the mind that peer behind the veil and doors of perception … is still and will always be ours.""', '      View this post on Instagram            ', 'A post shared by Wes Walker (@wes_walker_)', '""Ours,"" however, may have been an overstatement. While this is all quite run of the mill self-promoting pablum, as one often finds in such captions, the director was quickly taken to task by other creatives who pointed out that his ad in large part repackaged another\'s work — and much more difficult and valuable work at that.', 'The caption says that 35mm was a part of this ""mixed media"" production. What probably should have been said is there was an entire existing but unmentioned film-based production, directed by Gustav Johansson two years ago. ""Cool film, But all the stuff with athlete is shot by André Chementoff [Chemetoff ] and from a commercial I did?"" asked Johansson in a comment.', '      View this post on Instagram            ', 'A post shared by Gustav Johansson (@gustav_johansson)', 'It looks really good! But neither creator was initially credited in the caption, a professional courtesy that costs nothing and would have much more honestly represented who actually created the images seen here.', ""Johansson, Chemetoff and others showed up in the comments incensed not that their work had been used (it's inevitable in commercials) but that it was seemingly just redeployed as a cost-cutting measure and credit taken without acknowledging their contribution."", 'In an apparently now-deleted comment, Walker says that they did ask for access to Joshua, but ""were rejected several times. UA had limited time, limited budget, 3 weeks from ideation to delivery... Timeline, budget, access, and the realities of production are all real and highly limiting concerns with commercials of this level.""', '""UA get to do what they want with the footage of course but slippery slope you as a creative saying it’s AI when it actually humans behind it? AI has nothing to do with it really, it’s more how you choose to label and promote your work [is] even more important when times are shifting,"" wrote Johansson in conversation with Walker.', '""The future is brands training Ai on their products, athletes, aesthetics + repurposing existing footage bases + using Ai to do more with less in less time,"" wrote Walker. (After arguing for some time, he did relent and successfully petitioned to have credits for them and others added to the post.)', 'This perspective had creatives from around the industry coming out of the woodwork to decry what they perceived as another step down the road of AI not replacing what they do but being used by companies to take advantage of them. While there is an expectation that commercial work will be abused and reused to some extent, they pointed out there is a vast gulf between shooting stock footage or everyday stuff, and being commissioned to create a film with a unique treatment and creative vision — but both are being treated as raw material by brands.', 'Spawning lays out plans for letting creators opt out of generative AI training', 'Wrote cinematographer Rob Webster: ""If times are shifting, surely it’s the responsibility of creatives to resist changes that allow agencies and brands to steal work from colleagues without appropriate credit.... The use of this technology is inevitable but the application of it, and discourse around it is very much in our hands.""', 'Video production firm Crowns and Owls: ""If you’re somebody that shoots for Shutterstock then you know you’re handing over work with the literal purpose behind it being re-use/recyclability. There’s a fundamental difference if you did a commercial three years ago and then it’s kept on a hard drive by a brand just so they can wheel it out and bastardise it whenever they don’t have \'time or budget\', which let’s be honest, is almost always and will be increasingly so.', '""The legality is the legality - corporate worlds will always thrive in the grey area, but there’s a blatant artistic moral coding that’s been overstepped here, and it signifies a pivotal moment. The change is already underway. As artists, now more than ever we must prove our worth and we must be in dialogue.""', 'Producer Elise Tyler asks: ""When you see the original, you begin to understand why this conversation needed to happen already. Why didn\'t they just commission the original director again? Why would a new director make an ungodly by most standards day fee to \'direct\' this? They didn\'t need crew, they didn\'t need locations, they didn\'t need craft... Filmmakers have to stand together as we traverse this new AI landscape. Not turn a blind eye and say \'but it\'s the future!\' ""', 'Director Ivan Vaccaro summed up what may be among creatives\' last resort: refusal. ""Saying no to a client and an agency is the most powerful creative and human tool we can have. Something that no artificial intelligence will ever achieve.""', 'While Walker and his production may be the villain of the week, they are hardly unique in their approach, and indeed the buck may not stop with him for accepting a job that may or may not be ethical, but with Under Armour for rushing a quick turnaround to capitalize on the AI craze.

The biggest issue is the company’s performance in North America, its largest market, which accounts for around two-thirds of its overall sales. In the third quarter results released in February, Under Armour reported stronger than expected net income of $114.1 million, but sales in North America were down 12 percent. International revenue was up 7 percent with strength in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.', 'In addition, Under Armour’s continued attempts to gain a true foothold in the performance footwear market has also been discouraging with sales in that category down 7 percent in the quarter.', 'Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, said Under Armour’s struggles in North America mean the company is losing market share, which is “not a good position.” Right now, he estimated that Under Armour has a 4.5 percent share of the U.S. market, down from 5.5 percent last year while upstarts On and Hoka continue to make inroads and Lululemon gains more fans. The two biggest players, Nike and Adidas, are essentially “treading water,” he said.', 'In addition, Johnson said that because Plank was still so entrenched in the company as executive chairman of the board and brand chief for the past four years, it must have been very difficult for Linnartz to chart a new path.', '“It’s a tough position when the founder is still hanging around, especially someone like Kevin who embodies the core DNA of the company, which is performance.”', 'Despite the turmoil, Johnson is optimistic that the return of Plank to the CEO role may be just what the company needs. “I think he can do it, he’s a dynamic guy and he’s coming at it from a more mature, thoughtful perspective,” he said. “They still have a great brand, even if they’ve lost a half step on newness. The question is whether Kevin can duplicate Steve Jobs’ return to Apple.”', 'Plank founded\xa0Under Armour\xa0in 1996 in his grandmother’s basement and served as\xa0its CEO and chairman of the board until January 2020, when he was appointed executive chair and brand chief. At the time, the company was faltering both in terms of sales as well as with scandals ranging from strip-club visits by senior executives to Securities and Exchange Commission investigations. He was succeeded by Patrik Frisk, a one-time CEO of the Aldo Group, in 2020. But Frisk’s tenure was also short, lasting just only two years.', 'Although Plank declined requests for an interview Thursday, he did share some insights with employees following the news. He credited Linnartz for helping “advance the company forward in many important ways, including elevating our leadership talent in product, design, supply chain, consumer loyalty and regional management. She also played a key role in focusing on our current strategy and challenging the balance between our strengths and opportunities. Much work still needs to be done, but her leadership helped put us on the right track toward winning.”', 'The letter then became more personal. Plank wrote: “Reflecting on my journey at UA, I realize that the principles of Be Humble/Stay Hungry resonate more strongly today than ever. During my time away from the president and CEO role, which spanned more than four years, I have learned many lessons — professionally and personally. This period of self-reflection and learning has been invaluable, shaping my understanding of our business and reinforcing our mission, vision and values. The experience of not being a CEO has taught me more about what it truly means to be a CEO. I am deeply humbled to have been entrusted by our board to lead Under Armour at this pivotal time for the company.”', 'But his key team has been dismantled, which could present complications for Plank.', 'Since her appointment, Linnartz replaced many of the company’s longtime employees and brought in a whole new team, including Yassine Saidi as chief product officer, Kara Trent president of the Americas, Jim Dausch as chief customer officer, Shawn Curran as chief supply chain officer, John Varvatos as head of design and Amanda Miller as chief communications officer. The company is still searching for a chief marketing officer and senior vice president for footwear.', 'This team that Plank is inheriting may shift again, sources speculate, as he sets out to rebuild the business with his own handpicked group.', 'In his employee letter, Plank added that his vision for the future of Under Armour is “not about revisiting any previous chapter” in the company’s history, but “instead, we will leverage the wisdom of our past experiences, applying this knowledge to ensure we make the best decisions in the chapter ahead — and make it our finest.”', 'Analysts were quick to weigh in with their thoughts about the abrupt change. Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital Markets, believes it was a “board-level decision” driven by a desire for further change — the directors were not satisfied with Linnartz’s dramatic C-suite changes and introduction of a rewards program, he wrote. Now it’s up to Plank to rediscover the magic that had marked the company’s explosive early growth.', '“We expect Mr. Plank is excited to reenter the role (this doesn’t appear a temporary/interim move), but we recognize that with further C-suite fluctuation, the burden of proof lies on management execution and results that show this is not repeating the recent past.”', 'Tom Nikic of Wedbush said the “musical chairs” of CEOs over the past few years “brings a level of inconsistency and uncertainty to the story that investors don’t really want to see.” Jim Duffy of Stifel agreed, saying the “revolving door of CEOs will likely weigh on the stock.”', 'Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, was even more harsh. He said the dramatic change in leadership “is emblematic of a brand that can’t quite decide which direction it wants to go in.\xa0Under Armour has already been through several rounds of change as it tries to address declining sales and issues with the brand but, as the latest set of poor quarterly results show, it has not yet found a successful path to rebuilding the business.”', 'He added that the departure of Linnartz, “who has just set out her vision for the company, likely means more shifts. The good news is that Kevin Plank is more than familiar with the company so should be able to quickly plot the route that he wants to take to get the brand back on track.”', 'But all these “twists and turns have created a brand that has become increasingly confusing to consumers and to wholesale partners,” he believes, and “remedying these problems are not simple, no matter who occupies the CEO seat.”', 'Linnartz also provided some further context on her impending departure on her LinkedIn page. She will remain as an adviser to Under Armour until April 30. She said she was “extremely proud of the progress our team has made.\xa0We have a strong foundation in place for future growth, including strengthening our team, evolving our products and marketing and increasing our focus on profitability.”', 'According to Siegel, parting ways with\xa0Linnartz will result in separation costs of a one-time cash payment of $2.6 million, twice her current salary, her fiscal year 2024 performance bonus, full vesting of her sign-on stock awards, valued at around $7.3 million, payment of her medical premiums for 24 months and the assumption of the lease on her Baltimore apartment until the middle of the year.', 'Best of WWD', 'Confidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?', 'San Francisco Authorities Seize Nearly $2 Million in Suspected Stolen Merchandise', 'Year in Review: The IPO Rush Transforming Fashion']"

Under Armour just does not have the geographic diversity. And it's missing out on growth and markets like China, where it's still relatively small, and which is really supposed to be a high growth area for sportswear. And so Under Armour does need to expand outside of North America."", ""I don't know, though, that Kevin Plank really intends to do that. I think he's probably more concerned right now about trying to get the sales up in North America. Besides geographically, Under Armour also needs to expand in other categories. The women's sales that Under Armour lagged men's by quite a lot."", ""And as we've seen with the success of brands like Lululemon, it's definitely necessary to have a very strong women's business to be competitive in activewear anymore. It's a bit disappointing that Under Armour just released one of the few female CEOs in the industry.

Under Armour's footwear business lags the other major competitors by quite a lot. It's only about 25% of Under Armour sales.

So I think it really needs to build that footwear business a little bit better."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Just thinking broadly here about the role of these founder CEOs-- as you said, Plank really never left. He retained 65% of the company's voting shares. We've seen other CEOs fall into the role of executive chairman over the years. Disney, Schwartz at Starbucks come to mind. We've seen this happen before. Is it a case that the founder just can't let go but really should? How do you solve this seemingly intractable problem?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: I definitely think that he never really wanted to leave. He was basically forced to resign as CEO, because there were a number of embarrassing press scandals involving his personal life. Then there was the issue with the SEC and the over distribution and the declining results. And so I think he was kind of forced to step back, but he never really wanted to. And so I'm not really surprised that he came back."", ""As far as fixing the problem at this point, there isn't any real easy way to do that, because he still has supervoting stock.

After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.', 'Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.', 'On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.', 'Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception.

While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 55.2% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.', ""While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable."", ""But, for MGM, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside."", ""Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets"", 'According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.', ""While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?"", 'They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.', ""However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces."", 'That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.', ""Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in MGM"", ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current year, five estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days while two have gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 5.9%.', ""Moreover, MGM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates.

Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Should You Invest in MCHP?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Microchip Tech, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.9% over the past month to $4.92.', ""Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Microchip Tech.

The biggest one day pop actually that we've seen in just about a month. And it was on the heels of that PPI print that we got out just before the bell this morning."", ""And the reason why we're seeing such a reaction play out within the Treasury market, within the bond market today, just because it shows how nervous the market is about Fed policy and exactly what the Fed's plan for rate cuts is going to look like later this year. When you take a look at those expectations right now, we know the market's pricing in three cuts before the end of the year."", ""When you take a look at the Fed swaps right now, they seem to be pushing out that first cut.

There aren't cuts coming. I mean, first from Apollo, Torsten Slok over there."", 'And I was struck by even Dr. Yardeni saying I mean, listen, I want to overstate it because his base case is still two cuts. But it was just interesting him telling clients, listen, increasing chances no cuts in his opinion.', ""SEANA SMITH: It is. And then you also square that with strategists out there who are still very optimistic, that we could even be getting more cuts than what the market is pricing in. We had Ryan Detrick on earlier today. And he was saying that he still thinks there's a 30% to 40% probability that the Fed could cut rates in May."", ""So he's not even talking about June. He's talking about May. So, clearly, much more optimistic if you want to look at it like that than what the market is currently pricing in. And, of course, what the bond market is telling us but there are very firm believers on both sides of this argument."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And then the other thing, of course, that you're watching that we've been talking a lot about is sort of the breakup of the Magnificent Seven.

But Tesla, I actually don't know what a near-term catalyst would be."", ""I mean, if the issue is like slowing EV demand, it's just interesting. You'll hear Bulls say long-term. It's energy storage, of course. They'll get into automation. But I don't know near-term what they're counting on."", ""JULIE HYMAN: I don't know."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Every time I talk to a bull.', ""SEANA SMITH: The street doesn't either."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And the other thing that you're looking at today oil prices."", 'SEANA SMITH: Oil. So this day now. So I wanted to end on something positive here and take a look at energy and how that performed today. The only S&P sector here to eke out gains, up just about 7/10 of a percent.', ""That riding on the back of the rally that we have seen in crude. We've got prices closing at the highest level that we've seen in just about four months. There was new supply data out today showing that supply is expected to lag this year."", 'Stockpiles are starting to dwindle.

It also recently initiated its first dividend with a forward yield of 0.5%.', 'Those moves convinced many investors that Salesforce was still a worthwhile investment, even if the macro and competitive headwinds were throttling its long-term sales growth.

It significantly expanded its ecosystem through acquisitions over the past decade, and it processes all of that data with its Einstein artificial intelligence (AI) platform to help companies make more informed decisions.', ""From fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2022 (which ended in January 2022), Salesforce's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29%. But over the past three fiscal years, its revenue growth slowed down as the macro headwinds drove companies to rein in their software spending. Fierce competition from Microsoft, which integrates its Dynamics CRM platform into its other cloud-based services, could be exacerbating that pressure.

Salesforce plans to have the assistant in market this winter.', 'Salesforce is also currently piloting a program called Assessment Generation, which standardizes health assessments and uploads that information into the cloud. Assessment Generation will be available this summer.', 'The tools link with its Health Cloud, which builds on Salesforce’s massive customer relationship management platform — a key differentiator for Salesforce compared to Google or Microsoft, Kennedy said. The executive shared what sets Salesforce apart from its cloud competitors, along with future AI priorities and how the government should regulate responsible AI.', 'This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.', 'SEAN KENNEDY: It starts with what differentiates Salesforce generally, right? We’re not going to sit in the clinical encounter between the doctor and the patient. That’s the electronic health record, that’s their space. A recording of that encounter is important. That’s not Salesforce.', 'But everything it takes to get the patient to that encounter — financially cleared for care, medically ready to engage in care — meaning they’ve been able to have a good experience, get their questions answered, schedule an appointment, be reminded to come in, complete eligibility checks and prior authorizations, we can do that whole journey.', 'So now, the clinician isn’t burdened with all this administration that they’ve had to deal with previously. Then after the encounter, it allows them to coordinate care on a longitudinal, ongoing basis. That’s where Health Cloud comes in. And that’s where Copilot is going to come in.', 'We’re starting around the patients. We’re going to help take actions for patients and members as the consumers of healthcare, and make our care coordinators, call center agents, much more productive.', 'Then we’re going to move over to our providers in a September-October release. We’re going to work on, how do we establish better relationships with providers that are in a community outside of the organization, or among those inside the organization? So you can strengthen those referral lines. You can have a much more knit-together clinically integrated network.', 'So that’ll be the next one from a generative perspective. And then there’s a range of others. But a lot in the conversational AI space.', 'Within that, remember, you’re doing summarization and generation of information. You’ve got this concept of what we call “actionable analytics,” where you can ask questions to receive data and immediately take action on it. So, “Tell me all males over 50 that have not yet had a colonoscopy.” It’ll give you that list. And then you can run a campaign around that and get scheduled appointments.', 'So now you’ve got turnkey, clinically informed marketing campaigns with attribution that all started with that generation of a cohort. That’s the unique thing. No one does that. That is impossible for any other vendor to do today.', 'There’s a number of people that are providing generative capabilities. They may be able to summarize a segment like we can. The difference is the way we’re sourcing and unifying data, and then creating that segmentation.', 'Salesforce, at its core, is a multi-tenant platform on a single codebase. This is very different than a lot of other organizations that have multiple tenants on different platforms. We have updated our entire back-end to maximize our ability to take more action downstream. That’s different than what Microsoft is doing. It’s different than Google.', 'What’s unique about us is our ability to take action on it using our customer relationship management capabilities, through our marketing cloud, health cloud and others. And those aren’t things that they have, because they don’t have that capability.', ""What’s the outcome you're looking for? If you’re looking to increase patients’ arrival rate, then you want to have a list of patients that may be at risk of not arriving. And you want to be able to send a message to notify them in a way that they expect to be notified. Some want a phone call, some want a text message, somebody an email. Sometimes you have to do it multiple times."", 'When they come back in and schedule that appointment, and they arrive, it goes back to that attribution — where that initial campaign that came out of the initial generated segments comes all the way back around. So now you can get an ROI on your efforts to action against that campaign from a population perspective. That round trip — that’s darn near impossible for anyone else to do without multiple vendors.', 'Huge priority. It’s the one of the top two industries at Salesforce — financial services and health are the biggest industries we have. And we operate globally, and AI is in everything that we do.', ""That’s why I say you can’t look at Salesforce as just the generative AI widget. It’s the platform that has been purpose built to support where we’re going with AI, sourcing data, unifying data, actioning the data. And then generative AI is going to provide us that capability across those segments. So it’s squarely in our strategy for how we're going to win in healthcare."", 'It’s a balance for sure. We were at the White House when Biden signed the executive order. I think that it’s important that we establish these guardrails around the use of AI, it’s really important that we have that human in the loop.', 'If I had a magic wand, what I’d want from the government would be transparency and openness. I think platforms need to be much more open, not only open with their application programming interfaces and their algorithms, but their documentation and organization. Salesforce — all our documentation is published online for folks to see. Our algorithms are going to be open and available for folks as they emerge.', 'I don’t think we can say that about a lot of other organizations in healthcare, but that’s the way we’re going to operate.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

On the other end of the spectrum, 67% of adolescents suggested they felt worse about themselves after being on social media.

You can also take a look at the social media sites to consider for brand advertising."", ""According to a report by Forbes, marketers use artificial intelligence to analyze data, extract important insights, and receive up-to-date information. Marketers also benefit from artificial intelligence to create campaigns, segment their audience, curate personalized content, and analyze performance. While the adoption of artificial intelligence is beneficial, 64% of marketers fear AI will replace their roles. Marketers also fear that automation will result in actions that do not support a company's marketing strategy. Instead of completely dismissing the integration of AI, companies are installing AI tools in their solutions that act as assistants to marketers."", ""Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one such example. It is a leading platform for marketing automation and customer relationship management. The company offers a range of artificial intelligence tools to streamline a company's marketing process. Companies use Salesforce, Inc.'s (NYSE:CRM) marketing tools to create segments, optimize customer journeys, integrate marketing and sales functions, implement triggers for customers, and establish cross-channel integration.

Customers can make purchases instantaneously without having to leave the social commerce platform. Sellers also benefit from the merger of business and content. The B2C segment dominated the market with a share of 55.97% in 2022. The consumer-to-consumer segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.6% between 2023 and 2029, suggesting why brands must look more into influencer marketing and selling.', 'Pinterest, Inc.

Marketers can gain important insights from customer data to create targeted campaigns and business decisions. Marketers can also use artificial intelligence tools to organize and contextualize data.', 'The customer journey from start to finish is extremely important for a company. Every customer may have a distinct customer journey and unique reasons to purchase a certain good or service. To ensure the specific needs of each customer are being met, businesses must focus on optimizing and enhancing the complete journey of a customer. Such stems from an elaborate focus on retaining customers instead of attracting new ones.', ""Like every other business operation and function, marketers also need to benefit from innovation. Design tools like MidJourney and automation tools like HubSpot are essential for a company's marketing strategy. While these tools may be used, a company may also engage in developing personalized tools for themselves."", 'Owned media is the type of media or channels controlled by the company itself. While influencer and user generated content is essential, a brand must have its own creative assets such as a website, blog, social media, and email list.', ""Integrating brand values is highly necessary. Marketing strategies and campaigns must align with a brand's values and core beliefs. Marketers must also ensure that their messages are congruent across all channels."", ""The audience on LinkedIn is growing rapidly. Marketers suggest that posting on LinkedIn from an individual's account is more beneficial rather than posting from a company's page.

The strategy is focused on automated real-time bidding on ad placement. Such allows marketers to advertise to specific users in real time with personalized and customized messaging.', 'Marketing without a purpose is no longer enough to attract and retain customers. Sustainable and ethical marketing focuses on accounting for the social and environmental impact of a brand. Companies must ensure their activism is not limited to marketing and social awareness. Companies must dictate their commitment to society through their actions.', 'The popularity of social commerce is increasing across the globe. Social media companies like Pinterest, TikTok, and Instagram allow brands to market and sell their products on the same platform. This way, brands can optimize their content and products to sell them immediately.', ""Voice search optimization is another key marketing trend in 2024. The SEO technique ensures that a company's website is fit to model voice search queries. To ensure that a website is optimized to respond to voice search queries, marketers must ensure they are adjusting content, increasing page load speed, and adding images and structured data to enhance the customer experience."", 'Personalization is not just a buzzword in marketing. To attract and retain the right audience, brands must ensure that companies are offering personalized experiences to their customers. This can be achieved by customization of products, messages, deals, offers, and newsletters. To offer hyper personalized messages, marketers must be able to study the customer journey of each customer separately.', 'Augmented and virtual reality are expected to make a comeback in marketing. Brands are expected to develop more immersive brand experiences for customers. Companies may execute such by using interactive product demonstrations, virtual try-ons, and gamified campaigns. Companies can ensure they are providing personalized experiences to their audience.', 'Data privacy and data protection are key marketing trends of 2024. Customers are now more concerned about how their data is being used by companies. Brands must give more control to customers on how they allow their data to be used. Data encryption and biometric authentication are just a few ways to ensure consumer data is protected.', 'While having a strong social media presence is important, brands need to ensure they are investing in the right platforms. For instance, aiming to have a large presence on Instagram for a B2B business may not be the best marketing strategy.

According to McKinsey, the global industry is expected to deliver top-line growth of more than four percent in 2024. Despite the industry being prone to geopolitical and economic tailwinds, experience of the past couple of years has showcased the industry's strong resilience to economic turbulence. In 2023 however, the industry faced persistent and deepening challenges, pertaining to slow growth in the United States and Europe, and diminishing performance in China in the second half of the fiscal year. Furthermore, the luxury segment of the industry, which is responsible for some of the  highest quality underwear brands of 2024, fell victim to low demand in the first quarter of 2024, leading to slow sales and uneven performances. In 2024, the most prevalent sentiment around top apparel stocks like NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is uncertainty in the face of subdued economic growth, skyrocketing inflation, and diminishing consumer confidence.\xa0"", 'As the global industry is posited to grow by four percent in 2024, the luxury segment is expected to make up for much of the share of economic profit. However, even in the luxury segment, companies are expected to face an uphill battle amid a complex economic atmosphere. With consumers reining in spending post-pandemic, European and Chinese markets are expected to slow down, while the market in the US is expected to pick up post the first half of 2024, shedding light upon the slightly more optimistic outlook there.

(NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) are turning to the development of generative AI capabilities to offset economic hardships and identify new pockets of value to unlock key drivers of performance. Apart from simply identifying and classifying new datasets, generative AI boasts the capability of creating new information, including but not limited to audio, code, images, text, simulations and videos, by making use of deep learning models which can balance a litany of complex tasks simultaneously. As the global economic outlook plummets, some of the  highest quality underwear brands of 2024 have been experimenting with basic AI and other frontier technologies like the metaverse, NFTs, and digital IDs to build upon its digital footprint. However, up till now, any entry into the generative AI space has remained scarce, partly owing to its relatively new interface and partly to its worrisome bugs. However, all indicators currently point to the technology becoming a game-changer for fashion companies in the next decade.

This technology could prove handy in codesigning, optimizing content development processes, and creating new spaces for creativity overall. Although any use of gen AI in the apparel industry is still premature, the technology has made itself of use in certain key areas already, namely product innovation, marketing, and sales and customer experience. In these areas, the results of implementing gen AI capabilities is more practical in the short-term and has generated robust results, especially with regards to some of the highest quality underwear brands of 2024. According to the report, the implementation of gen AI is not merely about automation but also about augmentation."", 'One of the primary uses of gen AI in the fashion industry is within the areas of product development and innovation. Instead of relying on exhaustive market reports and trend analyses to create the collections for the upcoming seasons, mass-market fashion retailers and luxury brands like NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) can tap into their generative AI capabilities to analyze various types of unstructured datasets in minimal amounts of time. For instance, the technology is able to aggregate and analyze data around the highest quality underwear brands of 2024 from sources on social media or model trends from consumer data.', 'According to a report by Bloomberg, the global surge in the production of apparel products has exacerbated carbon emissions and other ecological detriments. This has led to a massive shift in consumer sentiment, with many consumers now saying that they would prefer purchasing from the highest quality underwear brands which also ensure minimal environmental injury. This has led to major players like NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) commit to producing sustainable apparel alternatives and to fix loopholes in their supply chain. Companies like Adidas AG has reported that 96% of its polyester use in 2023 was derived from recycled material. According to Hugo Boss AG and The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS), more than 93% and 81% of their cotton supply was acquired from more sustainable sources respectively. Many other companies are following suit.\xa0\xa0', 'However, according to another report by Bloomberg, product returns are gravely undermining corporate efforts to reduce their environmental footprints and integrate sustainability imperatives into their day-to-day operations. According to the report, nearly 25% of apparel purchases in the United States get shipped back. This is an enormous concern for some of the highest quality underwear brands of 2024 considering the fact that transporting returned goods churns more than 15 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.

We picked brands which appeared at least twice in these sources, assigning them an average ranking based on the numbers at which they appeared on the lists.

He is the author of numerous publications on averted school violence and many other topics, including, A Comparison of Averted and Completed School Attacks from the Police Foundation Averted School Violence Database."", 'Why should we study averted acts of violence against schools?', ""The rationale behind Safe and Sound Schools' Averted School Violence Project is that we can learn about how and why intended school attacks were stopped. By studying such averted school attacks, we can better identify failure points in safety systems, recognize those policies and practices that may have led to a foiled act, and thereby invest more wisely in school safety. From a practical standpoint, averted incidents occur more frequently than completed attacks, giving us a bigger sample to learn from. We identify and analyze completed attacks as well. The ultimate goal, of course, is to prevent future attacks."", 'Any surprises when comparing completed versus averted acts of school violence?', 'Surprisingly, our data indicate more similarities than differences when we study averted and completed targeted school attacks. For example, averted and completed attacks occur with more frequency in suburban and rural communities than in urban communities. Public high schools with less than 2,000 students are the most frequent targets of current or recently former students, ages 14-18, who plan or carry out targeted school attacks.', 'One critical difference between averted and completed attacks is how leakage is handled. Leakage occurs when others know about the planned attack before it occurs because the intended perpetrator has told someone, posted a threat online, and so on. Unfortunately, in completed acts, either this leakage was not reported, or if it was reported, no one acted on it. As we are learning from averted incidents, as in the example from Washington above, leakage did lead to the planned attack being foiled. Maybe it was a friend, a family member, or another student, but someone reported this leakage to the local or school police, or to educators, so that someone intervened.', 'One of the ""surprises"" we are seeing now is that persons planning targeted school attacks are getting younger, and more and more of the planners are engaged in online extremist and/or violent ideology.', 'We caution, however, that the ASV data is based on incidents we identify in the public domain (usually news reports or social media) or that educators or others in the school community report to us. We know we are missing instances of school violence that were averted but went unreported, which is why we want to really encourage publicity of the database and increase reporting.', 'What insights does the ASV data provide for school-based behavioral threat assessment teams?', ""Behavioral threat assessment teams are critical to identifying high-risk/high-need students and preventing targeted school attacks. One of the important lessons we've learned is that behavioral threat assessment teams represent the first step in what can be a long process of intervention and management of high-risk adolescents in a community context. These multi-disciplinary behavioral threat assessment and management teams have an opportunity to identify concerning behaviors, intervene, and therefore stop intended acts of violence."", ""But what is concerning? What should get their attention? ASV provides critical information regarding the motivations, behaviors, and methods of persons who planned and or completed the more than 300 incidents of school violence recorded in the database. It's a good source of information on the types of behaviors that intended attackers were exhibiting on their pathway to violence."", 'How has the ASV data been used to address needs?', ""We learned from our data on averted and completed school violence that the high-risk/high-need student that comes to the attention of a behavioral threat assessment team has to be managed in the community as well as the school. Even more critically, these individuals can be lost between systems-school, mental health, law enforcement, juvenile/criminal justice, and other agencies-particularly when they leave school and fall from everyone's radar."", ""These data, in part, led to a new program, Prevent 2 Protect, a collaborative effort by Michigan State University's Department of Psychiatry and Safe and Sound Schools to prevent adolescent involvement in school violence. In Michigan, high-risk/high-need students identified by school behavioral threat assessment and management teams can be referred to Prevent 2 Protect. If the student meets our criteria, they receive a full psychiatric evaluation, an in-depth assessment of criminogenic factors, and a needs assessment. The student and their families receive an individualized care plan and then work with our community-based intensive support teams-a case manager and a mentor-who help the student and their caregivers navigate support and intervention systems longitudinally. We are thrilled that the state of Michigan has invested in providing this program to its state's educational community for the next five years."", 'How can schools and police departments contribute to the ASV database?', 'School personnel, law enforcement, mental health practitioners, students, parents, and other members of school communities can enter an incident into the Averted School Violence Database. Reports can be made anonymously, or the persons can provide contact information, which allows the ASV team to follow up (confidentially) and obtain additional information.', 'What barriers are you facing in this work?', ""Funding has posed challenges over the years. However, we have received increasing financial support from the Motorola Solutions Foundation. Michigan State University's Prevent 2 Protect project is also providing financial support through September 2027. The funding has allowed us to rebuild the website and database, which will facilitate user access and improve data analysis and reporting. Increasing the number of averted incidents reported to the database by practitioners in the field remains a challenge. Most of the incidents were identified by the ASV team in the media or in social media."", 'What can the Justice and Prevention Research Center (JPRC) do?', 'The JPRC can continue to help promote the Averted School Violence project and encourage members of school communities to report incidents of averted and completed school attacks to the database. This article is a great start. We also welcome the JPRC as a research partner as we move ahead to make schools and communities safer.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Motorola Solutions on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Motorola SolutionsWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/motorola-solutions Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Motorola Solutions', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

Resultantly, companies engaged in AI have become the talk of the town, and with each company trying to outmaneuver the other, the competition within the AI space has also reached a point where investors are now faced with many excellent AI stock picks. In such a saturated market of the best AI stocks, it is becoming more important to research to find out which stock will best fit your portfolio.', 'Our research on the AI sector has revealed several attractive names to us, such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, these are not the only companies investors should be keeping an eye on. Companies such as SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S) and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) can be considered attractive AI plays as well and are contributing much to the AI race. For instance, on March 14, Tomer Weingarten, the CEO of SentinelOne, Inc. (NYSE:S), joined CNBC\'s ""Money Movers"" to discuss the company\'s work in the AI space. Here\'s what he said:', '""In our market, we\'re really helping customers transform their antiquated infrastructure. Arguably, this is one of the most critical points for most customers out there... when we engage with customers, we\'re not only trying to give them remarkable technology, we\'re also trying to give them a ton of value... I think that resonates with customers. They\'re looking for ways to get AI-enabled, and you have to start by really revamping your infrastructure, collecting your data, making sure its accessible, making sure you gain insights from that data... If you look at what\'s happening today, especially the threat landscape, what attackers are doing, they\'re moving at incredible speeds. If you are, as a defender, trying to protect from these attacks, it\'s also clear that you need to move at machine speed yourself. So you have to have AI really driving automotation across the enterprise, and that\'s exactly what we deliver to customers.""', 'Weingarten\'s comments drive home the fact that AI is the future, and companies wishing to remain in the tech race must be equipped with this technology. Similarly, Palantir Technologies Inc.\'s (NYSE:PLTR) CEO, Alex Karp, joined CNBC\'s ""Money Movers"" on March 13 to discuss what sets his company apart from the Googles and Microsofts of the market. Here\'s what he said:', '""Everyone\'s making the same claim. The claim is that you can get a Large Language Model to increase your output at a lower cost, so you get more sales, more revenue, higher margins. We\'re making the same claim, the only difference is we\'re not making a claim, we\'re saying \'we will show you, while they tell you.\' The most important thing is now, we\'ve set a standard. The standard is that we\'re going to make the enterprise more efficient, we\'re gonna make the enterprise stronger, and have innovation work in a way that it\'s differential.""', 'These insights show that while the AI market has become incredibly saturated by big tech names, several other companies have contributed to the growth of AI and are beginning to gain traction as well.

Stock appreciation was supported by strong quarterly results above expectations with 24.5% year-over-year subscription revenue growth in constant currency and 30% non-GAAP operating margins despite ongoing macro complexities. In addition, the stock benefited from growing investor expectations that the company would benefit from the integration of GenAI technology into its products, and a rise in software stocks more broadly. Management noted that key business drivers included strong traction with government customers, improving momentum with new customers, and budget consolidation into platforms like ServiceNow. In addition, the company launched its GenAI-supported product line, sold under a new higher-priced Pro Plus sku, at the end of the quarter and has already signed on multiple customers with hundreds more in the pipeline. The new product line should generate material efficiencies for customers as it improves their ability to automate and digitize, and hence we expect broader adoption of the Pro Plus sku, creating an additional growth engine for ServiceNow, supporting the company’s long duration of growth.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105', 'Adobe Inc.

Additionally, Alphabet hit nearly $70 billion in free cash flow, suggesting it has the resources to retain its powerful role in tech and invest in high-growth areas.

As the youngest of these seven stocks, Tesla had been thought of as the next big thing that could one day assume the crown of largest company in the world.', ""But the past year hasn't turned out that way. In fact, Tesla's fortunes have gone in reverse, with its market value now well out of the top seven companies."", ""Yet does this year's underperformance mean Tesla should now be excluded from this venerated group?"", 'The other Magnificent Seven stocks all share certain traits in common. One is obvious: market cap, or total company size. The term was initially used to name the seven largest companies in the world outside of Saudi Aramco.', 'On this criterion alone, Tesla no longer qualifies. Its 28.6% decline this year and 57.1% plunge from all-time highs has caused it to fall well out of the seven largest stocks this year.', 'In fact, at a $565 billion market cap, Tesla is now the 13th largest company in the world, or 14th if one considers Saudi Aramco. Larger ""non-Magnificent Seven"" companies include Berkshire Hathaway, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Broadcom, and Visa. Each of these companies is now larger than Tesla in terms of market cap.', 'But there\'s a reason why these companies are called ""magnificent"" just beyond their market cap. Among these reasons are deep competitive advantages, along with the ability to scale over much of the globe, leading to high margins and perpetual growth.', 'For instance, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (GOOGL) has a 90%-plus market share of search, leading that category all over the world outside China, and also owns streaming video leader YouTube and the Android OS, one of only two major mobile operating systems. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) benefits from the inherent network effects of social media and has scaled globally as the universal social profile site worldwide. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) similarly dominates PC operating systems, enterprise software, and business social media via LinkedIn and is part of powerful oligopolies in the growth industries of cloud computing and video games. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) dominates U.S. and international e-commerce and is a first-mover and leader in global cloud computing. And Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) obviously has perhaps the most dominant consumer franchise of all time with the iPhone, which is incredibly valuable real estate upon which to sell more services to its global user base.', ""These deep competitive advantages, along with massive global scale, generally enable several financial characteristics. This includes the financial wherewithal to invest in new products and services, enabling long-term growth above global GDP, all while achieving high margins and capital returns. While Amazon may be an exception in terms of margins and capital intensity, it's also known that Amazon spends most or all of its underlying profit on new products and services, even inventing new categories on its own, such as cloud computing. Moreover, it has broken out its cloud unit's operating margins, which generally track near 30%, and its growing digital advertising empire is likely to have very high margins as well, if Google's and Meta's margins are any indication."", 'The question is, does Tesla fit in with the financial characteristics of these other six companies?', ""That's not a black or white answer. However, Tesla's financials and competitive advantages don't seem as robust, at least today. For instance, while Tesla bills itself as a disruptive clean energy technology company, it still generated over nearly 94% of its revenue from the sales of its cars and related services."", ""So, for all intents and purposes, Tesla is a car company at the moment. And the auto industry is generally less attractive than most others, as it's both capital-intensive and cyclical, leading to big swings in results. Moreover, as a mature market, its annualized growth over this decade is only projected to be a little over 4% on a global basis, according to Zion Market Research."", ""While Tesla seemed like it was on its way to making tech-like margins in the car industry, the recent slowdown in the electric vehicle market has shown Tesla isn't immune from the harsh auto sector cyclicality. Amid a price war and discounts, Tesla's operating margins have declined from 16.8% in 2022 to just 9.2% in 2023. Moreover, operating margins appear to still be trending down at 8.2% in the fourth quarter."", 'In this downturn, in which EV adoption appears to be slowing due to cost, Tesla has cut prices to be competitive. That should be a reminder that the car industry overall is fairly fragmented and competitive. In the U.S. alone, Tesla only garnered a 4.2% market share in 2023. While that was up from 3.8% in 2022, it took some severe price cuts to grow that unit share and Tesla is still well behind the top five industry leaders, which each have greater than 9.8% share.', ""So, from both an operating margin perspective, market share, and industry perspective, it doesn't appear that Tesla belongs in the same category as the Magnificent Seven."", ""That being said, that is not to say Tesla can't regain that status in the future. This will likely depend on how quickly electric vehicles replace traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles while fending off hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell alternatives to battery EVs."", ""Despite its low overall market share in the auto space, Tesla did achieve a dominant 55% market share of the electric vehicle market last year in the U.S. So, if Tesla can dominate the EV niche, and if EVs eventually replace ICE vehicles, Tesla should be able to scale up and get its operating margins going back in the right direction. Furthermore, if Tesla's recent price cuts allow it to gain more and more market share in EVs, leading to bankruptcies or consolidation among the competition, then Tesla's lead in EVs will eventually become even more robust."", 'In addition, other products such as its superchargers could lead to nice recurring revenue growth as more and more electric vehicles charge up over time. And of course, there is the potential for new technology breakthroughs in terms of renewable energy, storage, or autonomous driving.', ""However, there aren't really tangible proof points of these positive factors at this point in time. While Tesla's services revenue, including charging revenue, showed growth last year, that growth slowed and was just flat quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. Renewable energy deployment only grew 10% with unclear profitability, making up just 5.7% of Tesla's revenue."", ""Meanwhile, while it's likely EVs will eventually grow to make up most or even nearly 100% of the auto market, it could be quite a long road to get there – as in decades. Meanwhile, all legacy carmakers are pursuing their own electric vehicle strategy as well. So, it's not clear that Tesla's dominant share of the electric vehicle market will hold. After all, last year, Tesla saw a 10-percentage-point decline in U.S. EV market share, from 65% to 55%, as more and more competitors came out with their own new EV designs."", ""Potential breakthroughs in AI and autonomous driving and the launch of an autonomous ride-hailing service are probably the things most likely to launch Tesla back into venerated Magnificent Seven status. However, it's impossible to know if Tesla will achieve that ahead of several competitors pursuing the same breakthrough or if the world will be ready for widespread autonomous driving anytime soon."", ""I don't think Tesla currently belongs in the Magnificent Seven at this time, especially as it's the 13th-largest U.S.-listed company. Could I be wrong? Absolutely. But only time and Tesla's execution on next-generation technologies will tell."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\xa0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way."", ""But I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club."", ""Founded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online."", ""Now, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand."", ""Chairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly."", ""In a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\xa0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built."", 'Oracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.', ""While OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future."", ""Oracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill."", ""At the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online."", ""AI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure."", ""Oracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation."", 'According to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).', ""Assuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually."", ""While Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger."", 'Remember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.', ""AI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

But over the past three fiscal years, its revenue growth slowed down as the macro headwinds drove companies to rein in their software spending. Fierce competition from Microsoft, which integrates its Dynamics CRM platform into its other cloud-based services, could be exacerbating that pressure.

Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.', ""As previously touched on, Paychex is a growing business, which is encouraging. The growth of EPS may be the eye-catching headline for Paychex, but there's more to bring joy for shareholders.

69,05a10787-3f3b-3944-bed3-dc6456d5822f,SBUX,2024-03-15,Starbucks is negotiating with its unionized workers. Here’s why this is good news for America,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-negotiating-unionized-workers-why-113646322.html,1710416206,STORY,['SBUX'],"['This month, Starbucks and its unionizing workers set an example that could rewrite the template for how employment serves workers in America by agreeing to sit down at a table together and work out a national deal. If other companies follow suit, we might move toward an economy that works for the millions of people it currently fails.', 'This moment resolves, at least for now, a years-long battle that started with a single location on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo. Against all odds, 19 workers in that store voted to unionize. They made international news and inspired thousands of workers to do the same at roughly 400 Starbucks locations (and counting). Unlike the stereotype of disgruntled workers squeezing the company for a few more (often deserved) dollars, these workers generally loved working at Starbucks and wanted to shape its practices, asking Starbucks to live up to its values.', 'Starbucks was taken aback. It had, until that point, a reputation as an exceptionally good employer. It paid well, offered health insurance, covered the cost of a college degree, offered stock in the company, and more–even calling employees “partners.” However, when some of those partners wanted the power of a union, Starbucks felt it was a step too far.', 'The company, until the last few months, fought these “partners” at every turn: Howard Schultz flew out to speak personally to workers (scaring them by comparing them to prisoners in a concentration camp), they intimidated and fired organizers (and the government charged Starbucks with breaking the law many times), closed stores, filed lawsuits, and even extended new benefits only to locations that had yet to unionize (arguably illegally). Throughout, Starbucks maintained that it had broken no laws and that it supported its workers’ rights of free association and to bargain collectively.', 'In fighting workers, Starbucks nearly undid its hard-earned reputation as a generous employer. Many of its own managers, in headquarters and elsewhere, started questioning the wisdom of digging in against the unionizing workers.', 'And then, under new CEO Laxman Narasimhan, Starbucks began to shift course. The pressure might finally have been enough. At the end of last year, Starbucks agreed to sit down with the parent union, Workers United. This month, they agreed to begin bargaining for a contract with the union workers, among other concessions. For the first time, all the unionized locations across the country can have a single conversation with the company to negotiate a contract with workers. (All while the former CEO, Howard Schultz, cryptically posts about the company losing its soul.)', 'Starbucks workers have now earned a victory that should inspire those in other companies and other industries. And Starbucks has set a new standard for corporate leadership–assuming the company follows through, stops union-busting, and quickly reaches an agreement with workers.', 'Other corporations will see that it’s possible to have a functional partnership with this new generation of unions, who often want something more than just higher pay.', 'Corporations are a partnership between leadership and the workforce. In any good partnership, each party needs to have real power. For too long, businesses have made a prerogative of limiting their workers’ share, destroying the balance of power, and touting the benefits to consumers and shareholders. While this strategy has short-term benefits for individual companies in the form of reduced costs, in the long run, it makes them more brittle.', 'I’ve spent the last few years speaking to businesspeople about organized labor and teaching the country’s first business school class on leading an organized workforce at UC Berkeley. In my job as a venture capitalist, I want to see companies innovate and grow rapidly. I believe that empowered, organized workers can be part of that, and even–under the right conditions–accelerate it.', 'Companies such as Microsoft, Ben & Jerry’s, and others are changing the national conversation by being more collaborative with organized labor–and we now have a group of three dozen “labor open” businesses in a group at the Aspen Institute spanning industries from finance to media to construction and more.', 'When companies and unions form successful relationships, they both benefit. Workers feel like they are part of building something and have a true seat at the table. Companies enjoy improved worker retention and training, better customer service, and–though this flies in the face of most business school curricula–they can avoid stagnation and accelerate innovation by tapping into their workers’ insights.', 'The last few decades of waning worker power have left the economy in a precarious state. When working people struggle to feel empowered, provide for their families, keep a roof over their heads, get the health care they need, and secure a dignified retirement, this drags the whole system down and makes our society less stable, fair, and dynamic. We’ve seen the extremism that has resulted from this unfortunate trend.', 'A better future in which workers feel they have true ownership in the companies where they work and can lead a dignified life is possible. This future doesn’t require technological breakthroughs or omnibus legislation. It doesn’t depend on the composition of the Supreme Court. All it takes is a change in the way workers organize and in the way corporations engage with them. Starbucks might just join the club of new corporate leaders treating organized workers with the respect they deserve and the law requires. This is all the more impactful given the reversal of the company’s strategy: A prodigal child has returned to reclaim the goodwill it had lost. Other corporations should follow.', 'Roy Bahat is the chair of the Aspen Institute Business Roundtable on Organized Labor and a venture capitalist.', 'Here’s\xa0how the U.S., Europe, and China are faring\xa0in the post-pandemic race for economic growth', 'Global trade is at a critical juncture–and we can’t take it for granted,\xa0WTO meeting chair\xa0warns', 'The U.S. housing market is headed into\xa0a pivotal spring season\xa0as home sellers wait for their sweet spot, according to Opendoor', 'The anti-DEI movement has gone\xa0from fringe to mainstream.

Following the recent job report and inflation data, the Fed is likely to continue the cautious approach to lowering interest rates in the short term. Amid this, REITs’ interest expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term. Moreover, supply-chain constraints and high material costs may raise development costs.Given this backdrop, investors should consider betting on defensive asset categories within the industry that portray resiliency and have solid fundamentals that will drive growth. Players like Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. HST and Gladstone Commercial Corporation GOOD are likely to prosper.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Other sector comprises a diverse collection of REIT stocks representing various asset categories, including industrial, office, lodging, healthcare, self-storage, data centers, infrastructures and more. Equity REITs lease out space within these properties to tenants, generating income through rental payments. Economic growth assumes a central role within the real estate sector as economic expansion directly correlates with higher demand for real estate, increased occupancy rates and greater bargaining power for landlords to command higher rental rates. Moreover, the performance of Equity REITs hinges on the specific dynamics of their underlying assets and the geographic location of their properties. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly explore the fundamentals of these asset categories before making any investment decisions.', ""What's Shaping the Future of the REIT and Equity Trust - Other Industry?"", 'Economic Uncertainty to Hurt Activity in the Near Term: An uncertain business environment is likely to affect occupier sentiment. Investors are expected to maintain a cautious approach in the near term, especially regarding significant business transactions. Clients are exhibiting reduced urgency in making new commitments and are still waiting for further price discovery. Asset-category-wise, though continued job expansion is expected to boost demand for office space, leasing activity is likely to be affected amid hybrid work setups and ongoing uncertainty in the broader business climate. In the self-storage asset category, there is new customer price sensitivity, and this headwind from lower new customer rates is likely to affect these REITs’ performance in the near term. Further, given that the initial surge in tower activity related to the early stage of the 5G investment cycle has peaked, demand for tower REITs is expected to mellow down in the quarters ahead, hurting profitability.Supply-Chain Woes & High Material Costs Linger: Overall economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest continue to lead to supply-chain constraints at various stages. This, coupled with elevated interest rates, has pushed up the cost of raw materials, resulting in higher development costs. In addition, REITs are highly dependent on the debt market to carry out their development and redevelopment activities. Also, following the recent job report and inflation data, the Federal Reserve is likely to continue adhering to the cautious approach to lowering interest rates in the short term. As a result, interest expenses are still likely to be on the higher end in the near term, affecting their ability to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds. Further, with high interest rates still in place, the dividend payout of REITs might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.Resilient Demand Across Certain Asset Classes Gives Scope for Growth: Demand for certain asset categories is likely to remain healthy in the near term. Expected acceleration in the senior citizen population and a rise in healthcare spending by this age cohort in the upcoming period, as well as pent-up demand for medical services, augur well for Healthcare REITs’ medical property demand. Meanwhile, the e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations have continued to provide an impetus to the industrial and logistics real estate space over the past years. Though there has been some cool-off in the warehouse and the manufacturing sectors, the healthy labor market is likely to keep U.S. consumers strong and keep demand for industrial real estate healthy. For hotels, the scenario seems encouraging as growth in income is likely to support consumer spending and keep leisure demand steady. Also, with a continued improvement in the group business and a steady recovery in the business transient, the operating environment is likely to be stable. Further, in this digital era, there is high demand for inter-connected data center space, with enterprises and service providers continuing to integrate artificial intelligence into their strategies and offerings and advance their digital transformation agendas.

On one path, we find the high-flying tech and growth stocks that have rapidly recovered or even exceeded their pre-pandemic highs. On the other, more treacherous trail, many deeply undervalued stocks still wallow below their former glory.', 'I believe now presents a golden moment to pick up shares of sturdy businesses on the cheap before a rising tide lifts these boats, too. Just as I advised buying into the downtrodden tech sector back in 2022, it pays to scoop up the deeply undervalued stocks poised for their own comeback.', 'Nearly two years later, many retail investors have missed out on the impressive tech rebound since mid-2022.

Let’s take a look!', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com', 'I am very bullish on Block (NYSE:SQ) moving forward, as many catalysts are aligning in its favor. First and foremost, the company is finally profitable after many investors viewed Block as a faster-growing yet unprofitable alternative to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). However, now that Block is generating profits, not only is this company expanding at a quicker pace, but it is also producing earnings. These profits are projected to increase rapidly in the upcoming years, with its EPS expected to triple from 2024 to 2030 alongside solid double-digit revenue growth down the line.', 'In addition, Block has $6 billion in debt that will weigh less heavily on its balance sheet once interest rates decline. That will also free up substantial cash flow. Block is well-positioned to gain significantly from the current boom in the crypto market since the business has built up meaningful exposure to blockchain technology. With its profitable operations, scaling revenues and leveraged position in crypto, I believe Block is easily one of the most deeply undervalued stocks at the moment and can produce multibagger returns over a multi-year period.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a communications firm that possesses major assets in the industry. However, broadband expansion has been tepid in recent years. Furthermore, Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), another business it has a sizable stake in, is also struggling to expand its broadband network. Charter only added 155,000 broadband subscriptions for all of 2023, about 10% of its prior rate. Consequently, LBRDA’s stock price has plunged 40% from its Oct. 2023 peak.', 'Nonetheless, I believe now is an optimal time to buy at a discount, as I don’t anticipate broadband connections will substantially decline over the long term. The government is allocating substantial capital to develop broadband infrastructure and 5G. Most importantly, Liberty Broadband owns a 26% stake in Charter Communications worth $18 billion at year-end, yet it trades at a massive discount to that value, with a $8 billion market cap. This significant discount, along with accretive buybacks funded by selling CHTR shares, makes LBRDA very inexpensive relative to its net asset value.', 'Source: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com', 'Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a diversified industrial firm that manufactures tools, storage solutions, digital automatic doors, healthcare products and industrial goods. The stock has plunged 58% from its 2021 peak and is far below pre-pandemic values. One primary reason for Stanley Black & Decker’s steep decline is its high debt level following several major acquisitions in recent years.', 'However, I believe the stock will inevitably rebound to pre-pandemic prices and beyond once interest rates fall.

Near-term cash flow guidance is somewhat weak, but I do not think there is substantial downside risk from here. The long-term upside potential far outweighs the limited downside risks.', 'Leggett & Platt is focused on maintaining its investment-grade credit rating.

InTest is one of these smaller semiconductor firms, and it now sits 57% off its June 2023 highs.

Gross margins expanded both sequentially and year-over-year. While the trend in bookings slowed in Q3, management sounded optimistic on the earnings call about near-term demand drivers in automotive and computing.', 'It trades at just 12 times forward earnings and 1 times sales, which are very inexpensive metrics for a semiconductor company, even with slower growth.

It beat revenue estimates by 13%. Once interest rates eventually ease, profits could outpace expectations even more. The 5.8% dividend yield also appears sustainable given the current trajectory and leading industry position.

The 6.43% dividend yield also sweetens the deal. It trades at 3.3 times forward earnings and 0.7 times forward sales. Analysts anticipate 23% EPS growth in 2024 and 10% the following year.

Biden is betting that this populist approach will set him apart from his predecessor (and rival) Donald Trump, whose 2017 tax cuts dramatically reduced the government’s income.', 'Indeed, some of America’s most successful corporations did so well during this period, they paid more money to their C-suite than to Uncle Sam, according to research released this week from the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness, two nonprofits that support tax reform.', 'Ford, Netflix, Salesforce, Tesla, T-Mobile and 30 others paid more to their executives than they did in federal income taxes between 2018 and 2022, found the report. Altogether, 35 companies paid more to their C-suite than to the federal government over that five-year period, according to the research, which looked at corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and previous research from the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy.', '“It’s no coincidence that some of the nation’s most notorious tax dodgers also pay their executives too much,” write the report’s authors, calling executive pay “out of control.”', '“Executives are rewarded for ‘tax efficiency’—the euphemism for corporate tax dodging—which is often an easier way to raise profits than by creating goods and services more customers want to buy,” they write.', 'Take Tesla. The electric carmaker had been losing money for years before becoming consistently profitable in 2019; over the five-year period in the report, it booked $4.4 billion in U.S. income. CEO Elon Musk, who spent years as the world’s richest person thanks largely to Tesla stock, was able to negotiate the largest executive pay package in history. Despite this, the company’s total federal income tax over that period was less than zero—it received a $1 million refund.', 'That’s because Tesla has benefited from generous government subsidies in the form of grants and tax credits for clean-energy projects, whose value has been calculated between $3 and $5 billion. “They really are the king of subsidies,” Zachary Tashman, senior researcher at Americans for Tax Fairness, told Fortune.', 'And Tesla took advantage of a popular provision in the tax code—using years of losses, from its early, unprofitable days, to reduce its tax liability in the present.', '“Companies are allowed to ‘carry forward’ excess losses to years with profits, with the old losses canceling out current earnings,” the report explains. That’s how Tesla, which last year made $10 billion in profit on $96 billion in revenue, was able to pay no federal income tax.', ""“Tesla had some lean years domestically, but clearly it was not so lean that they couldn't give Musk a $2.28 billion pay package in 2018,” Tashman said."", 'Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.', 'A Delaware court recently voided Musk’s record-breaking pay package, which could have netted him nearly $56 billion, in response to a shareholder lawsuit; Musk is likely to appeal that decision. “But even if that whole package gets eliminated, Tesla would still have paid their executives more than in taxes, because their overall [federal tax] rate is so low,” Tashman said.', 'Carrying over losses from less- to more-profitable years is a very common tactic in the corporate world. (It’s also an option for individuals, as former President Trump famously demonstrated.)', '“Everybody does it; this is actually built into the tax code,” Jennifer Blouin, a professor of financial management and accounting at Wharton School of Business, told Fortune. “The federal government thinks this is a nice way to help companies over bumpy times.” Currently, no limit exists on how long companies can take advantage of past-year losses.', 'While Tesla benefits from many unprofitable years, competitor Ford takes a different tactic—shrinking its U.S. profits on paper, according to ATF.', '“Even though 70% of the company’s assets are located in the U.S. and nearly two-thirds of its revenue is domestic, less than half of their pre-tax income is ascribed to the United States,” the report says. As a result of moving some of its profits to less-taxed nations, the company was able to pay just $121 million in U.S. federal income taxes over five years, one-third of the $355 million it gave its executives over that time period.', 'Ford did not respond to a request for comment.', 'In theory, Ford could have a good reason for reporting lower profit in the U.S. than abroad—if, for instance, it had heavy research and development expenses and the bulk of its executive team here, it’s possible those higher costs would offset its domestic revenue for a lower profit, Blouin noted.', 'Netflix, the largest and most profitable streaming service, uses yet another tactic to lessen its tax burden—offering stock options to executives. The “stock option loophole” cut Netflix’s tax liability by $1 billion over five years, according to the report.', 'Stock options, which let employees buy a successful company’s shares at a substantial discount, are popular with many fast-growing companies as they can allow for generous compensation packages. From a tax perspective, though, this creates a two-faced problem. Companies are allowed to report the options’ lower value on investor reports (thus making profits look higher) while reporting their higher value for income-tax purposes (thus making profits, and by extension taxes, lower).', 'That’s especially helpful for Netflix, which gave the bulk of top execs’ pay in stock options, according to the report.', 'In a statement, a Netflix spokesperson said, “Netflix complies with tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world.\xa0 From 2018-2022 we paid global income taxes in excess of $2B and in 2023 we paid nearly $1.2B in global income taxes, the majority of which was U.S. federal income tax.”', 'Stock options are a particularly visible issue now, with the market near record highs, noted Michael Meisler, a former partner at Ernst & Young who now lectures at Baruch College.', '“The use of equity-based compensation is pretty prevalent in these large companies, and\xa0you’re looking at it at a point where a lot of these companies are at all-time highs,” Meisler told Fortune. “Two years ago, a lot of these people thought they were underpaid somehow.”', 'Public companies report estimates of federal income tax payments in securities filings; they are also required to report the compensation of only the highest-paid five employees. Because of this, “almost certainly, we’re under-guessing what these companies pay their executives,” Tashman said.', 'View this interactive chart on Fortune.com', 'The tax paid by U.S. corporations has been flat for years, despite steadily rising profits. However, the five-year period starting in 2018 was especially low thanks to tax cuts implemented under the Trump administration.', 'In 2021, just 6% of the federal government’s revenue came from corporate income taxes, Meisler noted. Some of that is because not all businesses pay taxes as corporations (others are partnerships or S-corporations, which simply funnel their income to individuals), but a great deal of that is because corporate tax rates have fallen dramatically in recent decades, while tax credits and sweeteners have proliferated.', 'And companies are legally required to take advantage of all the breaks they can to increase their profits, according to Meisler.', '“Once you write the laws, the corporate tax director has their job, within the scope of the law, to minimize their tax liability,” he said. If “I can minimize my taxes by 10 cents a share, they kind of have a duty to their shareholders to do that.”', ""That's a problem, according to tax-reform groups, including IPS, ATF, and the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy. These progressive groups are advocating for a higher corporate tax rate from the current 21% and for the U.S. to join the OECD international tax framework agreement, which would implement a global minimum tax rate and reduce the incentive for companies to shift their profits globally."", 'In ATF’s view, the problems of highly -paid executives and insufficient taxes are two sides of the same coin.', '“Executives are in part reaping rewards for the corporate tax avoidance strategies they pursue, and corporate boards have more money to spend on their highest-paid employees when they don’t have much or anything to pay in taxes,” the report says. “Until this self-reinforcing cycle is broken, we’ll have a corporate tax and governance system that works for top executives—and no one else.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

According to McKinsey, the global industry is expected to deliver top-line growth of more than four percent in 2024. Despite the industry being prone to geopolitical and economic tailwinds, experience of the past couple of years has showcased the industry's strong resilience to economic turbulence. In 2023 however, the industry faced persistent and deepening challenges, pertaining to slow growth in the United States and Europe, and diminishing performance in China in the second half of the fiscal year. Furthermore, the luxury segment of the industry, which is responsible for some of the  highest quality underwear brands of 2024, fell victim to low demand in the first quarter of 2024, leading to slow sales and uneven performances. In 2024, the most prevalent sentiment around top apparel stocks like NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is uncertainty in the face of subdued economic growth, skyrocketing inflation, and diminishing consumer confidence.\xa0"", 'As the global industry is posited to grow by four percent in 2024, the luxury segment is expected to make up for much of the share of economic profit. However, even in the luxury segment, companies are expected to face an uphill battle amid a complex economic atmosphere. With consumers reining in spending post-pandemic, European and Chinese markets are expected to slow down, while the market in the US is expected to pick up post the first half of 2024, shedding light upon the slightly more optimistic outlook there.

Apart from simply identifying and classifying new datasets, generative AI boasts the capability of creating new information, including but not limited to audio, code, images, text, simulations and videos, by making use of deep learning models which can balance a litany of complex tasks simultaneously. As the global economic outlook plummets, some of the  highest quality underwear brands of 2024 have been experimenting with basic AI and other frontier technologies like the metaverse, NFTs, and digital IDs to build upon its digital footprint. However, up till now, any entry into the generative AI space has remained scarce, partly owing to its relatively new interface and partly to its worrisome bugs. However, all indicators currently point to the technology becoming a game-changer for fashion companies in the next decade.

This technology could prove handy in codesigning, optimizing content development processes, and creating new spaces for creativity overall. Although any use of gen AI in the apparel industry is still premature, the technology has made itself of use in certain key areas already, namely product innovation, marketing, and sales and customer experience. In these areas, the results of implementing gen AI capabilities is more practical in the short-term and has generated robust results, especially with regards to some of the highest quality underwear brands of 2024. According to the report, the implementation of gen AI is not merely about automation but also about augmentation."", 'One of the primary uses of gen AI in the fashion industry is within the areas of product development and innovation. Instead of relying on exhaustive market reports and trend analyses to create the collections for the upcoming seasons, mass-market fashion retailers and luxury brands like NIKE Inc.

This has led to a massive shift in consumer sentiment, with many consumers now saying that they would prefer purchasing from the highest quality underwear brands which also ensure minimal environmental injury. This has led to major players like NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) commit to producing sustainable apparel alternatives and to fix loopholes in their supply chain. Companies like Adidas AG has reported that 96% of its polyester use in 2023 was derived from recycled material. According to Hugo Boss AG and The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS), more than 93% and 81% of their cotton supply was acquired from more sustainable sources respectively. Many other companies are following suit.\xa0\xa0', 'However, according to another report by Bloomberg, product returns are gravely undermining corporate efforts to reduce their environmental footprints and integrate sustainability imperatives into their day-to-day operations. According to the report, nearly 25% of apparel purchases in the United States get shipped back. This is an enormous concern for some of the highest quality underwear brands of 2024 considering the fact that transporting returned goods churns more than 15 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.

If you want to skip our overview of the global biotechnology industry and the latest trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks To Invest In.', ""Biotechnology is the riskiest and fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry. The sector is typically made of firms that use biological ingredients to make their products, and since this requires vast amounts of investments, biotechnology stocks are among some of the riskiest that you're likely to find on the stock market. Naturally, this means that their performance as a category depends on investor risk appetite, and individual headwinds and tailwinds carry the potential of high volatility and significant upswings and downswings."", 'For instance, while most media attention is focused on the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Bitcoin, and perhaps rightly so due to sizeable tailwinds enjoyed by both in the form of potential demand for artificial intelligence products and global acceptance, biotechnology stocks have been quietly ticking along in the background. As an example, consider the shares of Vincerx Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:VINC), Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRBP), and Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX).', 'These biotechnology stocks belong to different categories of the stock market in terms of market capitalization. They range from micro caps (stocks with a market capitalization lower than $300 million) in the case of Vincerx, to mid caps like Viking Therapeutics. However, despite this, all three biotechnology stocks have delivered triple digit share price appreciation this year. NASDAQ:VINC, NASDAQ:CRBP, and NASDAQ:VKTX are up by 446%, 134%, and 267% year to date, showing that the right biotechnology stocks are no less than artificial intelligence stocks when it comes to rewarding investors for their shrewdness.', ""Digging deeper into their share price performance to see what tailwinds end up benefiting biotechnology stock prices, let's take a closer look at Viking Therapeutics. Just like NVIDIA's GPUs and their usage for artificial intelligence workloads have got investors rushing in hand over fist in the technology and semiconductor segments of the stock market, in the world of pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks, it's weight loss drugs that are causing all the hype. For Viking, the catalyst came just as February was ending after the firm revealed that patients part of a trial of its weight loss drug had ended up losing nearly 15% of their weight. This placed Viking right alongside pharma giants the likes of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) when it comes to targeting America's need for weight loss treatments - which some believe see as much as $33 billion in annual spending."", ""However, analyzing just one stock is unlikely to provide an accurate picture of how biotechnology stocks are faring as a category. For this, we have to look at the performance of either stock indexes made of such equities or exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide investors the ability to invest in sectors instead of firms to narrow down the volatility faced by individual stocks. On this front, one such index that is well known is the NASDAQ Biotechnology PR USD (NASDAQ:NBI) biotechnology stock index. Our hypothesis at the start of this piece was that category wise, biotech stocks are among the riskiest on the market due to large capital expenditures and long product timelines, and looking at the NASDAQ Biotechnology stock index, it dropped 11% in the 24 months of 2022 and 2023. This era was marked by a rapid interest rate hike and high inflation - both of which aren't good for firms that rely on large amounts of capital and costly inputs for their business operations. Yet, as the investment climate starts to become rosier this year, the index gained 3% until February end before reversing the trend."", ""Finally, before we head into our list of the most profitable biotechnology stocks, it's also important to see what the hedge funds are saying. For Polen Capital, while its fourth quarter of 2023 investor letter did affirm confidence in the weight loss giant Novo Nordisk, it was the third quarter letter that dived into the rationale of the investment decision:"", 'Regarding Novo Nordisk, we’ve covered the company for a long time and owned it many years ago, ultimately selling because of payor pricing pressure on the insulin business. What has changed the investment case for us, though, is the company’s innovation into GLP-1 drugs, which not only help diabetics control blood- sugar levels but have also shown significant efficacy in weight loss. Novo Nordisk’s best-known GLP-1 drugs, Ozempic (for diabetes) and Wegovy (for obesity), are already blockbusters, frequently grabbing headlines in global news publications for their significant results. GLP-1 drugs account for nearly 70% of Novo Nordisk’s sales today.', ""So, with these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable biotechnology stocks to invest in. A couple of notable picks are Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

Among Merck’s research efforts are trials focused on evaluating KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of these cancers, as well as identifying new combinations and coformulations with KEYTRUDA.', 'About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mg', 'KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.', ""Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers."", 'Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.', 'Cervical Cancer', 'KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemoradiotherapy (CRT), is indicated for the treatment of patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA cervical cancer.', 'KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, is indicated for the treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.', 'KEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.', 'See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.', 'Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA', 'Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions', 'KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.', 'Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments.

For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.', 'Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less.

Boeing’s document also guides airlines on how to disconnect electrical power to the seat.', 'As of 2022, the airline had nearly four dozen 787s in operation.', 'The US Federal Aviation Administration said it is also looking at Boeing’s Thursday notice to airlines about the cockpit seat switches, as well as its earlier notice from 2017. The agency is convening a board of safety experts to provide feedback to Boeing on its notice to airlines that operate the Dreamliner.', '“The agency will continue to monitor the situation closely,” the FAA said.', 'Asked by CNN if the service notice sent yesterday was due to some preliminary findings of investigators into the LATAM incident, a Boeing spokesman deferred all comment on the cause of the incident to the official investigators.', 'Dozens of passengers were injured when the plane plunged, as some were thrown to the ceiling of the cabin. One passenger told the media that a pilot had told him he had lost control of the plane when “my gauges just kind of went blank on me.” That comment suggested a new safety issue for Boeing, which as been struggling with years of safety and quality issues around its commercial jets.', 'CNN has yet to be able to confirm the Journal’s report about the cause of the plunge.', 'LATAM on Monday said the plane “had a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement,” adding it had landed as scheduled in Auckland. Asked about indications the problem with the flight was a cockpit mishap, the airline told the Journal the company is working with authorities on the investigation, but declined to comment further until the investigation is finished.', 'LATAM’s pilots union declined to comment. The company’s flight-attendant union didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.', 'In a statement to CNN Tuesday, Boeing said it was “working to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer.”', 'Investigators from New Zealand and Chilean aviation authorities are investigating the flight. LATAM is a Chilean airline. They are looking at information from the black boxes, which record data from airline instruments as well as an audio recording of what was said inside the cockpit. The black boxes have been removed from the plane and are in the possession of the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission.', 'It would be good news for Boeing if it is cleared of any fault in the LATAM flight. The company is facing multiple investigations by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board over an incident on a January 5 Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max flight in which a door plug blew out, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane minutes into that flight.', 'Fortunately no one was seriously injured on that flight from what could been a catastrophic accident. But the accident has brought a renewed focus to the safety of Boeing commercial jets, a record that included two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people.', 'Boeing has accepted legal liability for those crashes, which were attributed to a design flaw in the 737 Max. The Justice Department is now investigating whether or not the latest Boeing issues brought to light in the wake of the Alaska Air incident would violate a controversial deferred prosecution agreement the company reached in 2021, which could open the company for criminal liability.', 'An audit of Boeing since the Alaska Air flight by the FAA found multiple instances of “non-compliance issues in Boeing’s manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.” The agency has given Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to fix its quality issues. Boeing has said it is working to meet the FAA’s demands.', 'A preliminary report by the NTSB into the January 5 Alaska Air flight found that the plane had left the Boeing factory in October missing the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.', 'The NTSB report has yet to assess blame for the incident aboard the plane, but it has criticized Boeing for not having the documentation as to which employees worked on the door plug.', 'But Boeing executives have conceded the company must do a better job on the quality and safety of its aircraft.', '“Whatever final conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened,” said Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun in comments to investors when discussing the company’s latest financial losses. “An event like this must not happen on an airplane that leaves our factory. We simply must do better for our customers and their passengers.”', 'CNN’s Gregory Wallace and Angus Watson contributed to this report.', 'This story has been updated with additional reporting and context.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

They also could spell trouble for your wallet and the broader US economy.', 'One of America’s biggest manufacturers is dealing with some serious production, quality and safety problems that worsened this week after a 787 Dreamliner plunged suddenly mid-flight, injuring dozens of passengers. It’s not yet clear whether Boeing was to blame, but it came at a horrible time for a company grappling with some severe damage to its already-battered reputation.', 'Boeing’s crisis could result in more expensive airfares and weaker economic growth, economists say.', 'The aircraft manufacturer is a massive company with a workforce of more than 140,000 employees around the world, generating tens of billions in revenue each quarter as one of two global players in the production of planes, the other being Airbus.', 'Boeing’s production alone represents a significant part of America’s economy. But the country – and the world – relies on its planes for travel, business, deliveries and jobs.', 'Delays in deliveries, which Boeing and several airlines expect as it undergoes an intensive federal investigation of its manufacturing processes, could reduce the number of planes available to Americans and cut into all those economy-boosting benefits its normally provides.', 'Boeing’s mid-flight disasters, most notably an Alaska Airlines 737 Max door plug that blew off the side of the plane shortly after takeoff,\xa0clearly mean the company has issues to address.', 'Boeing has already slowed down production of its popular 737 Max jets as regulators scrutinize the company’s practices, which has already led to fewer flights being scheduled as airlines brace for snags in deliveries. The sharp 6.1% drop in new orders for durable goods in January was largely due to fewer order for Boeing jets.', 'Boeing reported this week that it shipped a meager 17 Max jets in February, which was half as much the company shipped in December. Southwest and United earlier this week said they expect Boeing to ship them fewer planes than they planned on receiving, so they’ll hire fewer pilots.', 'Fewer jets could also push up airfares.', '“Less supply of airplanes coming online means there’s going to be more demand for flying than capacity is able to fulfill, so that keeps upward pressure on airfares, all else equal,” Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, told CNN. “We have already seen airfares jump the last few months and it was up 3.6% in February.”', 'Boeing’s need to address its problems means it likely won’t cut back on hiring, even if demand for its planes weakens.', '“I don’t see them trimming labor at a time of serious quality concerns and if anything, Boeing might try to hire more to get the quality issues right,” José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN.', 'Higher labor costs would mean Boeing loses even more money, plunging the company into an even deeper financial hole. That would inflict even further damage to Boeing’s already-beaten down stock price.', 'When regulators believed Boeing would halt production of the 737 Max jet in January 2020, after two fatal incidents in 2019 and the subsequent grounding of those jets that year, the New York Fed estimated that the production shutdown could shave 0.4% from US gross domestic product in 2020, the broadest measure of economic output. (Boeing continued to build the 737 Max throughout the crisis).', 'Then, of course, the pandemic happened, which dealt an even tougher blow to the company, resulting in nearly $12 billion in losses that year.', 'The New York Fed analysis stated that “Boeing is a large firm that is highly integrated in the domestic production network” and that production stoppages can “have significant effects on the macroeconomy.”', 'Since Boeing is the single largest US exporter, weaker demand for its planes would means fewer exports, which contribute to GDP growth if they exceed imports — known as “net exports.”', 'Boeing hasn’t announced that it will stop producing any of its aircraft outright, but its plans to increase production of the 737 Max are on hold as the Federal Aviation Administration awaits for the company’s plan on how to end its continued quality issues.', 'And Boeing’s years of problems have led to success for its French rival Airbus, which has overtaken Boeing as the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer.', 'It’s not easy for airlines to switch manufacturers overnight, but the trend is clearly pointing in Airbus’ favor, and if US imports of Airbus planes for domestic carriers pick up as Boeing indeed suffers weaker demand, that would then weigh on America’s GDP.', '“The declining demand of plane orders by airlines for Boeing aircrafts might just get directed towards Airbus instead, and doesn’t just disappear,” Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, wrote in a statement to CNN.', 'She added that “this whole fiasco absolutely will likely have adverse effects on the aircraft manufacturing sector in the US” and that it would be “good for the European market.”', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

The company has been focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. It has been leveraging its stores to facilitate omnichannel capabilities, including buy online pick up in store (BOPUS) and ship from store. It has also been implementing several strategies to improve the guest experience and reduce wait time. Store expansion efforts are also expected to have acted as an upside.lululemon has been gaining from improving online demand. Its accelerated e-commerce investments to ensure a robust shopping experience bode well. The company has been investing in developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities. Some notable efforts in this space are curbside pickups, same-day deliveries and BOPUS. Gains from these initiatives are likely to have been reflected in its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 top-line results.In January 2024, the company reported strong holiday sales results. LULU stated that it witnessed balanced sales trends across channels, categories and geographies during the holiday selling period, which enabled it to raise its view for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company’s sales mainly benefited from its focus on fresher styles. Management noted that guests continued to respond positively to the innovative and versatile product offerings.Following a robust holiday season performance, management raised its guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. LULU expects net revenues to be $3.170-$3.190 billion for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023, indicating a 14-15% year-over-year increase.

The revised view reflects strong sales and effective cost management and operational efficiency.Our model predicts company-operated stores and the direct-to-consumer channel to register year-over-year revenue growth of 14.7% and 14.6%, respectively, in the fiscal fourth quarter. Other sales are anticipated to increase 14.5% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the company has been witnessing improved gross margins in recent quarters due to lower expenses. Gross margin gains have been resulting from lower air freight expenses, which have been aiding product margin, as well as a regional mix.We expect the adjusted gross margin to expand 130 basis points (bps) year over year to 58.7% in the fiscal fourth quarter, driven by a decline in the cost of sales due to lower freight expenses. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, management expects a gross margin of 58.6-58.7%, suggesting that lululemon has been successfully navigating market dynamics and optimizing its cost structures to achieve improved profitability.However, the company predicted gross margin growth to be partly offset by strategic investments to support growth, including supply chain, distribution centers, product teams and modest deleverage on occupancy and depreciation. This is likely to have resulted in an elevated SG&A expense rate in the fiscal fourth quarter.Management predicted SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, to deleverage 160-190 bps year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. The increase is likely to have been driven by its strategic decision to invest in growth initiatives, including efforts to improve global brand awareness.Our model predicts a fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin of 28.1%, down 20 bps from the year-ago quarter’s actual.

According to McKinsey, the global industry is expected to deliver top-line growth of more than four percent in 2024. Despite the industry being prone to geopolitical and economic tailwinds, experience of the past couple of years has showcased the industry's strong resilience to economic turbulence. In 2023 however, the industry faced persistent and deepening challenges, pertaining to slow growth in the United States and Europe, and diminishing performance in China in the second half of the fiscal year. Furthermore, the luxury segment of the industry, which is responsible for some of the  highest quality underwear brands of 2024, fell victim to low demand in the first quarter of 2024, leading to slow sales and uneven performances. In 2024, the most prevalent sentiment around top apparel stocks like NIKE Inc. (NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is uncertainty in the face of subdued economic growth, skyrocketing inflation, and diminishing consumer confidence.\xa0"", 'As the global industry is posited to grow by four percent in 2024, the luxury segment is expected to make up for much of the share of economic profit. However, even in the luxury segment, companies are expected to face an uphill battle amid a complex economic atmosphere. With consumers reining in spending post-pandemic, European and Chinese markets are expected to slow down, while the market in the US is expected to pick up post the first half of 2024, shedding light upon the slightly more optimistic outlook there.

(NYSE:NKE), The TJX Companies Inc. (NYSE:TJX), and Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) are turning to the development of generative AI capabilities to offset economic hardships and identify new pockets of value to unlock key drivers of performance. Apart from simply identifying and classifying new datasets, generative AI boasts the capability of creating new information, including but not limited to audio, code, images, text, simulations and videos, by making use of deep learning models which can balance a litany of complex tasks simultaneously. As the global economic outlook plummets, some of the  highest quality underwear brands of 2024 have been experimenting with basic AI and other frontier technologies like the metaverse, NFTs, and digital IDs to build upon its digital footprint. However, up till now, any entry into the generative AI space has remained scarce, partly owing to its relatively new interface and partly to its worrisome bugs. However, all indicators currently point to the technology becoming a game-changer for fashion companies in the next decade.

This technology could prove handy in codesigning, optimizing content development processes, and creating new spaces for creativity overall. Although any use of gen AI in the apparel industry is still premature, the technology has made itself of use in certain key areas already, namely product innovation, marketing, and sales and customer experience. In these areas, the results of implementing gen AI capabilities is more practical in the short-term and has generated robust results, especially with regards to some of the highest quality underwear brands of 2024. According to the report, the implementation of gen AI is not merely about automation but also about augmentation."", 'One of the primary uses of gen AI in the fashion industry is within the areas of product development and innovation. Instead of relying on exhaustive market reports and trend analyses to create the collections for the upcoming seasons, mass-market fashion retailers and luxury brands like NIKE Inc.

Companies like Adidas AG has reported that 96% of its polyester use in 2023 was derived from recycled material. According to Hugo Boss AG and The Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS), more than 93% and 81% of their cotton supply was acquired from more sustainable sources respectively. Many other companies are following suit.\xa0\xa0', 'However, according to another report by Bloomberg, product returns are gravely undermining corporate efforts to reduce their environmental footprints and integrate sustainability imperatives into their day-to-day operations. According to the report, nearly 25% of apparel purchases in the United States get shipped back. This is an enormous concern for some of the highest quality underwear brands of 2024 considering the fact that transporting returned goods churns more than 15 million metric tons of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.

Novo Nordisk continues to rake in money from its weight-loss drug Wegovy (and from off-label usage of its type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic.) Eli Lilly is hot on Novo Nordisk's heels with its new obesity drug Zepbound."", ""Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) remains on the outside looking in with this big opportunity. But that doesn't have to be the case. Should Pfizer acquire Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) to take on Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the obesity-drug market?"", ""Let's first look at the potential downsides to Pfizer acquiring Viking. One especially stands out: Pfizer already has two weight-loss candidates in its pipeline -- danuglipron and PF-07976016. The latter only recently advanced into clinical testing, so it has a long way to go. Danuglipron, though, is farther along in development."", ""Granted, the safety profile for danuglipron in Pfizer's phase 2 clinical study of the drug wasn't great. More than 50% of patients in the trial dropped out. Up to 73% of participants experienced nausea. However, those results were for a twice-daily dose. Pfizer plans to move forward into late-stage testing with a once-daily dose of the oral obesity drug."", ""There's also more pipeline overlap between Pfizer and Viking. Pfizer is evaluating ervogastat in phase 2 testing and PF-07853578 in phase 1 testing for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis. Viking has a NASH candidate in phase 2 clinical trials too -- VK2809."", ""Acquiring Viking would wipe out much of Pfizer's remaining cash stockpile. At the end of 2023, Pfizer's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled around $21 billion. If we assume that the company would have to pay at least a 50% premium to Viking's current valuation, a deal would cost Pfizer in the ballpark of $10 billion to $11 billion. The big drugmaker could arguably find better ways to invest its money."", ""Despite these objections, Pfizer could still find a buyout of Viking Therapeutics attractive. Why? Danuglipron could flop even with a once-daily dose. Meanwhile, Viking's VK2735 subcutaneous injection sailed through phase 2 testing with fantastic safety and efficacy, and the biotech is evaluating an oral version of the drug in a phase 1 clinical trial."", ""Some analysts project that the global obesity drug market could reach or even top $100 billion by 2030. That's too big of an opportunity for Pfizer to risk ceding to Lilly and Novo Nordisk. If the company has any qualms about danuglipron, acquiring Viking could be a great backup plan."", 'Pfizer has been clear that business development is a key part of its growth strategy. The company expects roughly $25 billion in new annual revenue from its dealmaking by 2030. Even with its acquisitions in recent years of Seagen, Arena, Biohaven, and Global Blood Therapeutics, Pfizer is almost certainly still looking for attractive buyout candidates.', 'I doubt that the overlap of NASH programs would be a big obstacle for Pfizer in acquiring Viking. Neither should price be a significant issue, unless a bidding war erupts between multiple big drugmakers.', 'So should Pfizer acquire Viking? I think the company\'s best bet is what we might call a ""weight-loss wait."" Pfizer expects to have pharmacokinetic data for danuglipron within the next few months, which should help determine its strategy in moving forward with a once-daily formulation.', ""But what if another player tries to buy Viking in the meantime? Pfizer could consider other acquisition candidates if it chose not to bid for Viking. For example, Altimmune reported promising results in November 2023 from a phase 2 study evaluating pemvidutide in weight loss. Even after its shares skyrocketed by around 350% over the last six months, Altimmune's market cap is still below $600 million."", ""I wouldn't rule out the possibility of Pfizer acquiring Viking Therapeutics. However, I wouldn't bet on it either. On the other hand, regardless of what happens next with the big pharma's business development efforts, Pfizer stock rebounding looks like a good bet."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.347. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Although the rate has not changed substantially since the preceding year, it is still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 10.5%. Age-wise, the population aged below 18 years had higher poverty rates than 18 to 64-year-olds and those aged above 65 years. Simultaneously, the poverty rate for those without a high school diploma was 25.2%, significantly higher than for those with at least a bachelor’s degree. Region-wise, the Midwestern states were in the middle poverty category, except for Minnesota which had a poverty rate of only 9.6%. In the West, one state was in the highest poverty category while two states were in the lowest. In the South, seven states had a poverty rate of 15% or more.', 'The rise in poverty in the US can be attributed to several reasons. Inflation and soaring costs of living built financial pressure, ultimately moving many families into the category of poor. US states with the highest inflation rates have also been previously covered. Demographics further aggravate the poverty situation. An analysis of Mississippi, one of the poorest US states, reveals that regions in the state that have the highest levels of poverty are those that host the largest Black populations. The inequality is evident from the fact that Black state residents tend to be thrice more likely to be poor than Whites.', 'Income serves as a major indicator of poverty since the poverty rate is based on the proportion of people who have their personal or family income below their poverty threshold. In 2022, 6.1% of the U.S. population had income below 50% of their poverty threshold. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas are some of the states that held the highest proportion of people with an income-to-poverty ratio below 50%. Furthermore, individuals living in near poverty were in high numbers in Mississippi and Arkansas.

The company is headquartered in Minnesota which has a low poverty rate of 9.6%. The company engages with the local communities to improve their economic well-being. As a part of its philanthropic efforts, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) gives clothing, essentials, and holiday gifts to those in need. The retailer reported that it has also committed to invest $100 million through 2025 to support economic prosperity in Black communities, a group particularly vulnerable to poverty, across the United States.', 'Washington is known for its strong economic performance since the state boasts a high labor productivity. The poverty rate in the state is 10%. The state hosts many multinational companies including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has added $205 billion to Washington’s GDP. As of January, 87,000 full-time and part-time jobs have been created by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the state.

After more than a decade of careful research, design, development, and testing, we believe da Vinci 5 will deliver on these goals and help drive the future of robotic-assisted surgery.”', 'Da Vinci 5 builds on Intuitive’s da Vinci Xi’s highly functional design, which surgeons and care teams around the world have used in more than 7 million procedures to date.

In preclinical trials with surgeons at all experience levels, Force Feedback demonstrated up to 43 percent less force exerted on tissue, which may translate to less trauma on tissue. The ability to measure this force adds an important new data stream to surgical data science, which can bring future analytical insights supported through artificial intelligence. Force Feedback instruments, which are optional for use with da Vinci 5, are cleared for use in the same procedures as da Vinci Xi, except pediatric and cardiac procedures, and a specific contraindication for the Force Feedback needle driver for use in suturing during hysterectomy and myomectomy procedures. ', 'Meaningful throughput and workflow enhancements: Da Vinci 5 has innovative features that are designed to help increase surgeon autonomy and streamline surgeon and care team workflow. \u200bFor example, da Vinci 5 has integrated key OR technologies, including insufflation and an electrosurgical unit. The system also includes an optimized user interface, with settings that are accessible by the broader surgical team and by the surgeon directly from the head-in menu. Surgeons have access to other key settings while head-in to help them stay focused on the surgical field.Together, these innovations will continue to streamline workflow in the OR and potentially save valuable time, without compromising patient safety. This can enable more efficient use of a hospital’s human and capital resources.', 'Expanded computing power and advanced data capabilities: Da Vinci 5 has more than 10,000 times the computing power of da Vinci Xi. This enables innovative new system capabilities and advanced digital experiences, now and in the future, including integration with Intuitive’s My Intuitive app, SimNow (virtual reality simulator), Case Insights (computational observer), and Intuitive Hub (edge computing system).', 'Greater surgeon comfort:\xa0The system features a redesigned console capable of customizable positioning, allowing surgeons to find their best fit for surgical viewing and comfort, including the ability to sit completely upright. The surgeon can make any necessary adjustments while their head is in the console, with options designed to fit different body types, including surgeons who are pregnant.', 'Da Vinci 5 will initially be available to a small number of customers in the U.S. who collaborated with Intuitive during the development period and those with mature robotic surgery programs. Intuitive will work with surgeons at these initial sites to generate additional data on the system’s use before a wider commercial introduction.', '“We strive to provide customers with technology that meets their needs and solves important problems,” said Intuitive’s Chief Medical Officer, Myriam J.

Although the rate has not changed substantially since the preceding year, it is still higher than the pre-pandemic rate of 10.5%. Age-wise, the population aged below 18 years had higher poverty rates than 18 to 64-year-olds and those aged above 65 years. Simultaneously, the poverty rate for those without a high school diploma was 25.2%, significantly higher than for those with at least a bachelor’s degree. Region-wise, the Midwestern states were in the middle poverty category, except for Minnesota which had a poverty rate of only 9.6%. In the West, one state was in the highest poverty category while two states were in the lowest. In the South, seven states had a poverty rate of 15% or more.', 'The rise in poverty in the US can be attributed to several reasons. Inflation and soaring costs of living built financial pressure, ultimately moving many families into the category of poor. US states with the highest inflation rates have also been previously covered. Demographics further aggravate the poverty situation. An analysis of Mississippi, one of the poorest US states, reveals that regions in the state that have the highest levels of poverty are those that host the largest Black populations. The inequality is evident from the fact that Black state residents tend to be thrice more likely to be poor than Whites.', 'Income serves as a major indicator of poverty since the poverty rate is based on the proportion of people who have their personal or family income below their poverty threshold. In 2022, 6.1% of the U.S. population had income below 50% of their poverty threshold. Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas are some of the states that held the highest proportion of people with an income-to-poverty ratio below 50%. Furthermore, individuals living in near poverty were in high numbers in Mississippi and Arkansas.

Instead, you're betting off searching for new targets among blue chip stocks. There's no better place to look for blue chips than in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) a select index of 30 U.S. stocks that represent every major industry."", ""The top dividend stocks on the Dow have changed a bit since Walgreens Boots Alliance was removed from the blue chips and replaced with Amazon. Let's take a look at the top three dividend-paying Dow stocks today to see if any are worth buying."", ""Verizon (NYSE: VZ) has been a popular dividend stock for years, but it's also been a disappointment for nearly as long. For several years, shares of the telecom headed lower as it lost market share to T-Mobile as it made strategic errors with its 5G rollout, costing it on coverage and losing customers as a result."", 'However, in recent quarters, Verizon has been on the rebound and its business has been stabilizing. The company has acquired new C-band spectrum to fill in a coverage gap in the midband spectrum that works well to provide both widespread coverage and can handle density.', ""After making efforts to repair those missteps, Verizon's postpaid phone subscriber growth has accelerated, and the stock has bounced off its earlier lows. The telecom giant isn't about to become a growth powerhouse -- management still expects its profit to decline this year -- but it seems to have overcome the biggest challenges facing the company. Verizon is highly profitable and the dividend is safe. It's a fine income stock to own, and shares could move higher if the company returns to profit growth."", '3M (NYSE: MMM) rivals Verizon for the highest-yielding Dow stock, but 3M is up there for the wrong reasons. The industrial conglomerate has rarely ever paid a dividend yield this high, but the yield has climbed because its stock price has fallen because of slowing growth on macro headwinds and other factors. The company also recently settled two multibillion-dollar class action lawsuits, which will weigh on its cash flow for close to the next decade.', 'There are also questions about whether 3M is still capable of being a disruptive innovator, as media reports have detailed a cultural malaise that has sunk into the company, stymying innovation, and the multibillion-dollar liabilities related to its PFAS ""forever chemicals"" and faulty military-grade earplugs could dissuade the company from further risk-taking.', 'The upcoming spinoff of its healthcare business could bring in as much as $12 billion over the next five years as 3M receives a windfall from the company to be known as Solventum, including a $7.7 billion special dividend at the time of spinoff and future dividends as 3M will retain a 19% stake in the business.', ""That will help 3M deal with its legal payments, but the struggles in the core business shouldn't be overlooked. Organic sales fell 3.2% in 2023, and the company expects organic sales growth of just flat to 2% for 2024. While 3M's yield is appealing, income investors can find healthier stocks to invest in elsewhere."", 'Like 3M and other chemical companies, Dow (NYSE: DOW) has also struggled of late. While volume sales were up 2% in its fourth quarter, net sales were down 10% to $10.6 billion, reflecting slower global macroeconomic activity and falling prices. Local prices decreased 13% because of lower feedstock and energy prices.', 'Operating income also fell by 7% to $559 million.', 'Like other Dow Jones Industrial Average companies, Dow is a leader in its industry, but it has little control over the kind of inputs that can significantly affect its business, like commodity prices and the strength of the global economy.', 'Five years ago, Dow was spun off from DuPont after the two companies earlier merged, and the stock has mostly traded sideways since then, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Based on the current headwinds facing the company and its forecast of continued softness in industrial demand into the first quarter, that pattern seems unlikely to change.', 'While its 4.9% dividend yield is reliable, the stock looks best avoided for now.', ""Of these three stocks, the choice is clear. Not only does Verizon offer the highest yield of any Dow Jones stock, but it's also the only one of the three whose business, and stock price, are clearly moving in the right direction. Verizon is growing revenue in wireless service, its core business. It operates in a stable industry. It's righting past strategic errors, and it's past its peak of capital spending in the 5G cycle, setting it up for increased free cash flow."", ""It's the best Dow Jones stock for income investors today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

Just as I advised buying into the downtrodden tech sector back in 2022, it pays to scoop up the deeply undervalued stocks poised for their own comeback.', 'Nearly two years later, many retail investors have missed out on the impressive tech rebound since mid-2022.

First and foremost, the company is finally profitable after many investors viewed Block as a faster-growing yet unprofitable alternative to PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). However, now that Block is generating profits, not only is this company expanding at a quicker pace, but it is also producing earnings. These profits are projected to increase rapidly in the upcoming years, with its EPS expected to triple from 2024 to 2030 alongside solid double-digit revenue growth down the line.', 'In addition, Block has $6 billion in debt that will weigh less heavily on its balance sheet once interest rates decline. That will also free up substantial cash flow. Block is well-positioned to gain significantly from the current boom in the crypto market since the business has built up meaningful exposure to blockchain technology. With its profitable operations, scaling revenues and leveraged position in crypto, I believe Block is easily one of the most deeply undervalued stocks at the moment and can produce multibagger returns over a multi-year period.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a communications firm that possesses major assets in the industry. However, broadband expansion has been tepid in recent years. Furthermore, Charter Communications (NASDAQ:CHTR), another business it has a sizable stake in, is also struggling to expand its broadband network. Charter only added 155,000 broadband subscriptions for all of 2023, about 10% of its prior rate. Consequently, LBRDA’s stock price has plunged 40% from its Oct. 2023 peak.', 'Nonetheless, I believe now is an optimal time to buy at a discount, as I don’t anticipate broadband connections will substantially decline over the long term. The government is allocating substantial capital to develop broadband infrastructure and 5G. Most importantly, Liberty Broadband owns a 26% stake in Charter Communications worth $18 billion at year-end, yet it trades at a massive discount to that value, with a $8 billion market cap. This significant discount, along with accretive buybacks funded by selling CHTR shares, makes LBRDA very inexpensive relative to its net asset value.', 'Source: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.com', 'Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a diversified industrial firm that manufactures tools, storage solutions, digital automatic doors, healthcare products and industrial goods. The stock has plunged 58% from its 2021 peak and is far below pre-pandemic values. One primary reason for Stanley Black & Decker’s steep decline is its high debt level following several major acquisitions in recent years.', 'However, I believe the stock will inevitably rebound to pre-pandemic prices and beyond once interest rates fall. That would enhance cash flow and make the business much more attractive. EPS is expected to climb from $4 to $7 from 2024 to 2026, alongside steady mid-single-digit annual revenue growth during that period.', 'We also can’t overlook that an infrastructure and construction boom has commenced in the U.S. That will naturally increase demand for the company’s tools.', 'Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com', 'Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG) has certainly seen some challenging years lately, as discretionary purchases like furniture haven’t exactly been flying off the shelves. However, I believe this diversified manufacturer is positioning itself for better days ahead. With the economy returning to normalcy, Leggett & Platt is expected to resume expanding earnings starting in 2025, likely followed by steady annual revenue growth in the low-single digits.', 'The stock trades at just 0.6 times forward sales and 17 times forward earnings, which are very inexpensive valuations for a stock with an 8.95% dividend yield. Near-term cash flow guidance is somewhat weak, but I do not think there is substantial downside risk from here. The long-term upside potential far outweighs the limited downside risks.', 'Leggett & Platt is focused on maintaining its investment-grade credit rating.

InTest is one of these smaller semiconductor firms, and it now sits 57% off its June 2023 highs. I believe it is bottoming out for the next leg up and could produce multibagger returns from here.', 'InTest continues to make solid progress despite broader semiconductor industry headwinds. Gross margins expanded both sequentially and year-over-year. While the trend in bookings slowed in Q3, management sounded optimistic on the earnings call about near-term demand drivers in automotive and computing.', 'It trades at just 12 times forward earnings and 1 times sales, which are very inexpensive metrics for a semiconductor company, even with slower growth.

It beat revenue estimates by 13%. Once interest rates eventually ease, profits could outpace expectations even more. The 5.8% dividend yield also appears sustainable given the current trajectory and leading industry position.

With big data representing an enormous opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), could Nvidia's relationship with Databricks spell trouble for Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR)?"", ' Databricks is the most valuable software start-up globally, and second most valuable privately held AI company -- sitting behind OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.', 'Databricks develops a data intelligence platform built on lakehouse architecture that combines elements of data lakes and data warehousing. Essentially, the platform optimizes the performance of applications to provide business intelligence and real-time analytics, data warehousing, and AI.', 'Palantir develops enterprise software solutions that it sells to both the public and private sectors. While the specifics of each Palantir software suite differ, the common thread linking them together is that the company specializes in accumulating large sets of data from disparate systems.', 'More importantly, Palantir helps decision-makers visualize this data in a map called an ontology. From here, business leaders can search through data libraries and run sophisticated queries to help make more informed, efficient decisions.', 'Databricks offers generative AI applications that can help power predictive modeling and large language models (LLMs) through its Mosaic AI platform. While Databricks may not be a direct threat to Palantir, I see the company as a tangential competitor.', 'Nvidia is at the forefront of the AI narrative at the moment. However, unlike cloud computing companies such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, Nvidia is more of a player in the hardware arena, given its commanding lead in the semiconductor space.', 'What investors may not realize is that Nvidia has quietly been making inroads in enterprise software. The company is an investor in voice-recognition company SoundHound AI, as well as robotics start-up Figure AI. Both of these areas present unique use cases for AI software applications.', ""AI-controlled speech recognition is an area that has garnered a lot of attention from the likes of Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and even Apple. Considering that industry research suggests the addressable market for this technology could reach $50 billion by the end of the decade, it's not surprising to see Nvidia make a leap."", ""Another move Nvidia is making in relation to enterprise software is its partnership with Snowflake. Nvidia's NeMo software is being integrated with Snowflake's cloud-based data warehousing capabilities."", 'With Databricks and Snowflake earning the support of one of the most important AI leaders out there, some investors may be wondering if Palantir is in trouble.', ""Although Nvidia's relationships with Databricks and Snowflake are interesting, I do not see them as a threat to Palantir. Broadly speaking, rising competition can be viewed as a positive. The reason is that innovation is often a byproduct of an increasingly intense competitive landscape."", ""When it comes to Palantir, the company is more than just a data integration or storage play. Palantir's real competitive advantage is that it spent nearly two decades developing -- and perfecting -- its software. Artificial intelligence (AI) is at the center of the company's intellectual property and is rooted in Palantir's DNA."", ""Of note is that the recent departure of Snowflake's CEO came at a time when AI was top of mind. I think this signals a lack of a clear AI vision, and while a partnership with Nvidia could be promising, it's likely too early to know for sure."", 'As it relates to Databricks, I think the relationship with Nvidia is much more clear. Databricks is an AI company, and on some level, it competes with Palantir. However, given the evolving AI landscape, I see multiple winners emerging in the long run.', ""Despite Databricks' support from Nvidia, Palantir has proven that it can win on its own. Given the company's revenue growth, sustained profits, and accelerated customer acquisition, combined with a tangible AI roadmap, I see Palantir as one of the best AI opportunities available to investors right now -- regardless of the competition."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

The chart below reflects this, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index delivering considerably more growth than the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 over the last decade.', ""So, it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has dedicated more than 40% of its portfolio to the high-growth industry. Meanwhile, Berkshire's holdings posted a compound annual gain of nearly 20% between 1965 and 2023."", ""While past growth isn't always an indication of what's to come, the tech market is a reasonably safe bet. Tech is an ever-expanding space that profits from consistent demand for upgrades to software and hardware products. With sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing growing rapidly, now seems an excellent time to invest in the industry."", 'So, here are three top tech stocks to buy in March.', ""If you follow tech even slightly, you're probably not surprised to see Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is on this list. The chipmaker won over Wall Street last year, illustrated by its 273% stock growth since March 2023."", ""The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) perfectly positioned it to profit significantly from the boom in AI as demand for the chips skyrocketed. As a result, Nvidia's quarterly revenue and free cash flow are up 207% and 430%, respectively, in the last 12 months."", ""Meanwhile, the AI market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. It's projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. The sector's potential indicates GPU demand is likely to continue rising for the foreseeable future, with Nvidia well equipped to continue enjoying significant gains from AI."", ""Additionally, this chart shows Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow have plunged 45% and 48% over the last year, respectively, meaning the company's stock is trading at its best value in months. Alongside a powerful role in AI, Nvidia is a screaming buy in March."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) climbed to the tippy-top this year, becoming the world's most valuable company by achieving a market cap above $3 trillion. The company is a tech behemoth, home to a range of highly potent brands that attract billions of users, including Windows, Office, Xbox, Azure, and LinkedIn. The success of these services has granted Microsoft leading roles in operating systems, productivity software, cloud computing, and even social media."", ""However, all eyes have been on Microsoft's expanding AI efforts over the last year. Heavy investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI led to a lucrative partnership and access to some of the most advanced AI models in the industry."", ""The Windows company has used OpenAI's technology to introduce AI features across its product lineup, such as new AI tools on its cloud platform Azure, and supported productivity in its Office software suite."", ""Microsoft's P/E of 37 means its stock isn't exactly trading at a bargain. However, its prominent role in AI and $67 billion in free cash flow make its stock worth the high price point, with the funds to continue investing in its business and retain its lead."", ""Like Microsoft, it's hard to deny Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) top spot in tech, with brands like Android, YouTube, and Google attracting billions of users worldwide. The success of these digital products has seen the company's annual revenue rise 90% in the last five years, with operating income up 135%."", ""Along with leading roles in online video sharing and search engines, Alphabet's most lucrative business is digital advertising. The popularity of its various services has resulted in almost endless advertising opportunities and allowed the company to achieve a 25% market share in the $740 billion digital advertising market."", ""In Alphabet's most recent quarter (Q4 ended Dec. 31, 2023), revenue increased by more than 13% year over year, beating expectations by $1 billion. Ad revenue slightly missed expectations in the quarter. However, its AI-focused Google Cloud segment posted revenue growth of 26% to $9 billion. Meanwhile, Google Cloud's operating income reached $864 million, versus the $186 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period. "", ""The company has some work to do to catch rivals in AI and cloud computing, but it's on a promising growth trajectory. Additionally, Alphabet hit nearly $70 billion in free cash flow, suggesting it has the resources to retain its powerful role in tech and invest in high-growth areas. "", ""Moreover, this chart shows that Alphabet's P/E and price-to-free cash flow are lower than three of its biggest competitors, making the Google company's stock one of the best-valued options in tech. Add in significant cash reserves and immense brand power, and Alphabet's stock is a no-brainer right now."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The healthcare industry has been facing a formidable challenge following the incident.', 'The attack on UnitedHealth brought a critical component of the healthcare payment processing infrastructure to a halt, affecting the flow of billions of dollars for healthcare providers, insurers and pharmacies. This paralysis has plunged numerous clinics into financial distress, with some facing the grim prospect of turning patients away or securing loans to continue operations.', 'Shares of UNH have lost 7.3% year to date compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline. The S&P 500 gained 8% in the same time frame.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The impact of the cyberattack has been particularly severe on smaller healthcare providers, including those offering vital services like chemotherapy. These practices rely on a steady flow of insurance payments to fund their operations and purchase necessary drugs.', ""The disruption has forced them to seek extended payment terms from pharmaceutical wholesalers or delay payments altogether, indicating the attack's extensive reach beyond immediate victims to broader segments of the $4.5-trillion U.S. healthcare industry. For instance, the Pontchartrain Cancer Center reported a drastic reduction to 40% of its typical payments, highlighting the severe financial crisis of these clinics."", 'In response to the crisis, UnitedHealth has been collaborating with U.S. health authorities and working on restoring its affected services. The company has made progress in resuming pharmacy services and is testing its medical claims network, aiming to alleviate the backlog of payments.

Efforts include easing regulations that may prevent patients from receiving care and allowing cash-strapped providers to seek advance payments from Medicare. Additionally, UnitedHealth has introduced programs to offer financial support to providers, acting on a case-by-case basis.', 'Recognizing the urgent need, drug distributors like Cencora COR and McKesson MCK, traditionally rigid in their payment terms, began to adapt their practices, offering lifelines to these vulnerable providers.', 'Cencora, for instance, responded to the crisis by extending payment deadlines and allowing providers to order more drugs than usual, albeit the extension was less than some had hoped for. Similarly, McKesson showed flexibility, adjusting its payment demands in recognition of the extraordinary circumstances facing healthcare providers. This adaptability from national distributors like Cencora and McKesson was critical in ensuring that clinics could continue to purchase necessary medications, thereby maintaining patient care during times of financial instability.', 'Furthermore, the pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb also stepped in, offering temporary adjustments in payment terms for crucial cancer and blood disorder medications. These concerted efforts by drug distributors and pharmaceutical companies highlight a collective response to an unprecedented challenge, underscoring the importance of collaboration and support within the healthcare ecosystem to sustain patient care in times of crisis.', 'This cyberattack underscores the vulnerability of critical infrastructure within the healthcare sector to digital threats. It highlights the need for enhanced cybersecurity measures and the identification of potential single points of failure within the healthcare system.

Zooming out, the stock is down 21% in the last three years. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 11% in the last three months.

Robinson Worldwide reported an EPS drop of 63% for the last year. The share price fall of 23% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, it has a TSR of -21% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Investors in C.H.

Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround.

This piece combines Ai video, Ai photo, 3D CGI, 2D VFX, Motion graphics, 35mm film, digital video and advances in Ai voiceover. Every current Ai tool was explored and pushed to the maximum."" [I have left ""AI"" as ""Ai"" throughout.]', 'Seen on its own, the ad is not in itself objectionable. Live footage is intercut with 3D models, landscapes and abstract scenes, all rendered in contrasty monochrome.', 'Walker claimed that the whole thing was done in three weeks flat, which is quite short for a major brand and athlete, and noted of the reliance on AI that ""Key in this industry shift is that we stay true to the core of what we’re here to do - tell powerful stories and uplift the human soul with beautiful, provocative and interesting visions...Ai will integrate into our workflows in ever evolving ways … but the heart and the mind that peer behind the veil and doors of perception … is still and will always be ours.""', '      View this post on Instagram            ', 'A post shared by Wes Walker (@wes_walker_)', '""Ours,"" however, may have been an overstatement. While this is all quite run of the mill self-promoting pablum, as one often finds in such captions, the director was quickly taken to task by other creatives who pointed out that his ad in large part repackaged another\'s work — and much more difficult and valuable work at that.', 'The caption says that 35mm was a part of this ""mixed media"" production. What probably should have been said is there was an entire existing but unmentioned film-based production, directed by Gustav Johansson two years ago. ""Cool film, But all the stuff with athlete is shot by André Chementoff [Chemetoff ] and from a commercial I did?"" asked Johansson in a comment.', '      View this post on Instagram            ', 'A post shared by Gustav Johansson (@gustav_johansson)', 'It looks really good! But neither creator was initially credited in the caption, a professional courtesy that costs nothing and would have much more honestly represented who actually created the images seen here.', ""Johansson, Chemetoff and others showed up in the comments incensed not that their work had been used (it's inevitable in commercials) but that it was seemingly just redeployed as a cost-cutting measure and credit taken without acknowledging their contribution."", 'In an apparently now-deleted comment, Walker says that they did ask for access to Joshua, but ""were rejected several times. UA had limited time, limited budget, 3 weeks from ideation to delivery... Timeline, budget, access, and the realities of production are all real and highly limiting concerns with commercials of this level.""', '""UA get to do what they want with the footage of course but slippery slope you as a creative saying it’s AI when it actually humans behind it? AI has nothing to do with it really, it’s more how you choose to label and promote your work [is] even more important when times are shifting,"" wrote Johansson in conversation with Walker.', '""The future is brands training Ai on their products, athletes, aesthetics + repurposing existing footage bases + using Ai to do more with less in less time,"" wrote Walker. (After arguing for some time, he did relent and successfully petitioned to have credits for them and others added to the post.)', 'This perspective had creatives from around the industry coming out of the woodwork to decry what they perceived as another step down the road of AI not replacing what they do but being used by companies to take advantage of them. While there is an expectation that commercial work will be abused and reused to some extent, they pointed out there is a vast gulf between shooting stock footage or everyday stuff, and being commissioned to create a film with a unique treatment and creative vision — but both are being treated as raw material by brands.', 'Spawning lays out plans for letting creators opt out of generative AI training', 'Wrote cinematographer Rob Webster: ""If times are shifting, surely it’s the responsibility of creatives to resist changes that allow agencies and brands to steal work from colleagues without appropriate credit.... The use of this technology is inevitable but the application of it, and discourse around it is very much in our hands.""', 'Video production firm Crowns and Owls: ""If you’re somebody that shoots for Shutterstock then you know you’re handing over work with the literal purpose behind it being re-use/recyclability. There’s a fundamental difference if you did a commercial three years ago and then it’s kept on a hard drive by a brand just so they can wheel it out and bastardise it whenever they don’t have \'time or budget\', which let’s be honest, is almost always and will be increasingly so.', '""The legality is the legality - corporate worlds will always thrive in the grey area, but there’s a blatant artistic moral coding that’s been overstepped here, and it signifies a pivotal moment. The change is already underway. As artists, now more than ever we must prove our worth and we must be in dialogue.""', 'Producer Elise Tyler asks: ""When you see the original, you begin to understand why this conversation needed to happen already. Why didn\'t they just commission the original director again? Why would a new director make an ungodly by most standards day fee to \'direct\' this? They didn\'t need crew, they didn\'t need locations, they didn\'t need craft... Filmmakers have to stand together as we traverse this new AI landscape. Not turn a blind eye and say \'but it\'s the future!\' ""', 'Director Ivan Vaccaro summed up what may be among creatives\' last resort: refusal. ""Saying no to a client and an agency is the most powerful creative and human tool we can have. Something that no artificial intelligence will ever achieve.""', 'While Walker and his production may be the villain of the week, they are hardly unique in their approach, and indeed the buck may not stop with him for accepting a job that may or may not be ethical, but with Under Armour for rushing a quick turnaround to capitalize on the AI craze. Perhaps they underestimated the passion of the creators whose decidedly analog and human-focused processes actually produce original and compelling content.', '[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45O3Z0EBWSw?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360]', 'Great, now we have to become digital copyright experts', 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/ai-powered-ad-ignites-creator-controversy-on-instagram/']"

In the third quarter results released in February, Under Armour reported stronger than expected net income of $114.1 million, but sales in North America were down 12 percent. International revenue was up 7 percent with strength in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.', 'In addition, Under Armour’s continued attempts to gain a true foothold in the performance footwear market has also been discouraging with sales in that category down 7 percent in the quarter.', 'Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, said Under Armour’s struggles in North America mean the company is losing market share, which is “not a good position.” Right now, he estimated that Under Armour has a 4.5 percent share of the U.S. market, down from 5.5 percent last year while upstarts On and Hoka continue to make inroads and Lululemon gains more fans. The two biggest players, Nike and Adidas, are essentially “treading water,” he said.', 'In addition, Johnson said that because Plank was still so entrenched in the company as executive chairman of the board and brand chief for the past four years, it must have been very difficult for Linnartz to chart a new path.', '“It’s a tough position when the founder is still hanging around, especially someone like Kevin who embodies the core DNA of the company, which is performance.”', 'Despite the turmoil, Johnson is optimistic that the return of Plank to the CEO role may be just what the company needs. “I think he can do it, he’s a dynamic guy and he’s coming at it from a more mature, thoughtful perspective,” he said. “They still have a great brand, even if they’ve lost a half step on newness. The question is whether Kevin can duplicate Steve Jobs’ return to Apple.”', 'Plank founded\xa0Under Armour\xa0in 1996 in his grandmother’s basement and served as\xa0its CEO and chairman of the board until January 2020, when he was appointed executive chair and brand chief. At the time, the company was faltering both in terms of sales as well as with scandals ranging from strip-club visits by senior executives to Securities and Exchange Commission investigations. He was succeeded by Patrik Frisk, a one-time CEO of the Aldo Group, in 2020. But Frisk’s tenure was also short, lasting just only two years.', 'Although Plank declined requests for an interview Thursday, he did share some insights with employees following the news. He credited Linnartz for helping “advance the company forward in many important ways, including elevating our leadership talent in product, design, supply chain, consumer loyalty and regional management. She also played a key role in focusing on our current strategy and challenging the balance between our strengths and opportunities. Much work still needs to be done, but her leadership helped put us on the right track toward winning.”', 'The letter then became more personal. Plank wrote: “Reflecting on my journey at UA, I realize that the principles of Be Humble/Stay Hungry resonate more strongly today than ever. During my time away from the president and CEO role, which spanned more than four years, I have learned many lessons — professionally and personally. This period of self-reflection and learning has been invaluable, shaping my understanding of our business and reinforcing our mission, vision and values. The experience of not being a CEO has taught me more about what it truly means to be a CEO. I am deeply humbled to have been entrusted by our board to lead Under Armour at this pivotal time for the company.”', 'But his key team has been dismantled, which could present complications for Plank.', 'Since her appointment, Linnartz replaced many of the company’s longtime employees and brought in a whole new team, including Yassine Saidi as chief product officer, Kara Trent president of the Americas, Jim Dausch as chief customer officer, Shawn Curran as chief supply chain officer, John Varvatos as head of design and Amanda Miller as chief communications officer. The company is still searching for a chief marketing officer and senior vice president for footwear.', 'This team that Plank is inheriting may shift again, sources speculate, as he sets out to rebuild the business with his own handpicked group.', 'In his employee letter, Plank added that his vision for the future of Under Armour is “not about revisiting any previous chapter” in the company’s history, but “instead, we will leverage the wisdom of our past experiences, applying this knowledge to ensure we make the best decisions in the chapter ahead — and make it our finest.”', 'Analysts were quick to weigh in with their thoughts about the abrupt change. Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital Markets, believes it was a “board-level decision” driven by a desire for further change — the directors were not satisfied with Linnartz’s dramatic C-suite changes and introduction of a rewards program, he wrote. Now it’s up to Plank to rediscover the magic that had marked the company’s explosive early growth.', '“We expect Mr. Plank is excited to reenter the role (this doesn’t appear a temporary/interim move), but we recognize that with further C-suite fluctuation, the burden of proof lies on management execution and results that show this is not repeating the recent past.”', 'Tom Nikic of Wedbush said the “musical chairs” of CEOs over the past few years “brings a level of inconsistency and uncertainty to the story that investors don’t really want to see.” Jim Duffy of Stifel agreed, saying the “revolving door of CEOs will likely weigh on the stock.”', 'Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, was even more harsh. He said the dramatic change in leadership “is emblematic of a brand that can’t quite decide which direction it wants to go in.\xa0Under Armour has already been through several rounds of change as it tries to address declining sales and issues with the brand but, as the latest set of poor quarterly results show, it has not yet found a successful path to rebuilding the business.”', 'He added that the departure of Linnartz, “who has just set out her vision for the company, likely means more shifts. The good news is that Kevin Plank is more than familiar with the company so should be able to quickly plot the route that he wants to take to get the brand back on track.”', 'But all these “twists and turns have created a brand that has become increasingly confusing to consumers and to wholesale partners,” he believes, and “remedying these problems are not simple, no matter who occupies the CEO seat.”', 'Linnartz also provided some further context on her impending departure on her LinkedIn page. She will remain as an adviser to Under Armour until April 30. She said she was “extremely proud of the progress our team has made.\xa0We have a strong foundation in place for future growth, including strengthening our team, evolving our products and marketing and increasing our focus on profitability.”', 'According to Siegel, parting ways with\xa0Linnartz will result in separation costs of a one-time cash payment of $2.6 million, twice her current salary, her fiscal year 2024 performance bonus, full vesting of her sign-on stock awards, valued at around $7.3 million, payment of her medical premiums for 24 months and the assumption of the lease on her Baltimore apartment until the middle of the year.', 'Best of WWD', 'Confidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?', 'San Francisco Authorities Seize Nearly $2 Million in Suspected Stolen Merchandise', 'Year in Review: The IPO Rush Transforming Fashion']"

So this was a surprise I think we can all safely say to most observers maybe even to those inside of the company. Why is it not being seen as a positive in the market that Plank is coming back?"", 'SAM POSER: I think we all have memories of how Kevin ran the business really between, I think, like 2015 and 2019. It was prior to COVID. It was when ""Sports Chalet"" and ""Sports Authority"" went out of business. And rather than pulling back, he wanted to keep driving top line sales and opened up distribution with product that was supposed to go to ""Sports Authority"" and ""Sports Chalet"" into Kohl\'s.', ""And then that product tripped on the product that was at Dick's and Hibbett and a few other retailers. And then the same items started being sold at different price points and so on. So it was a lot of trying to drive top line at the expense of brand. And so we're not really sure what happened and why she's leaving.

Right now, Under Armour does not do a very good job at all of differentiating its products so that the stuff that Under Armour sells at Kohl\'s (KSS) is not that much different than what it sells at a store like Dick\'s Sporting Goods (DKS).

Under Armour just does not have the geographic diversity. And it's missing out on growth and markets like China, where it's still relatively small, and which is really supposed to be a high growth area for sportswear. And so Under Armour does need to expand outside of North America."", ""I don't know, though, that Kevin Plank really intends to do that. I think he's probably more concerned right now about trying to get the sales up in North America. Besides geographically, Under Armour also needs to expand in other categories. The women's sales that Under Armour lagged men's by quite a lot."", ""And as we've seen with the success of brands like Lululemon, it's definitely necessary to have a very strong women's business to be competitive in activewear anymore. It's a bit disappointing that Under Armour just released one of the few female CEOs in the industry. You wonder then, will they have the same commitment to the women's business that we've heard from the company in the past.

Under Armour's footwear business lags the other major competitors by quite a lot. It's only about 25% of Under Armour sales. And it just simply does not have the distribution in stores like Foot Locker and specialty running stores that really a premier sportswear brand needs to have. So I think it really needs to build that footwear business a little bit better."", ""JARED BLIKRE: Just thinking broadly here about the role of these founder CEOs-- as you said, Plank really never left. He retained 65% of the company's voting shares. We've seen other CEOs fall into the role of executive chairman over the years. Disney, Schwartz at Starbucks come to mind. We've seen this happen before. Is it a case that the founder just can't let go but really should? How do you solve this seemingly intractable problem?"", ""DAVID SWARTZ: I definitely think that he never really wanted to leave. He was basically forced to resign as CEO, because there were a number of embarrassing press scandals involving his personal life. Then there was the issue with the SEC and the over distribution and the declining results. And so I think he was kind of forced to step back, but he never really wanted to. And so I'm not really surprised that he came back."", ""As far as fixing the problem at this point, there isn't any real easy way to do that, because he still has supervoting stock. So it doesn't seem to be much potential for an activist campaign, for example, or something like that. If things don't improve over the next couple of years with him as a CEO, then I think he's going to be under a lot of pressure to go outside and bring in an outside CEO again, even though it didn't work out so great the first time."", ""JARED BLIKRE: All right, well, we might be asking you to come on our program and talk about the fifth CEO in four years' time.

Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\xa0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way."", ""But I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club."", ""Founded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online."", ""Now, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand."", ""Chairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly."", ""In a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\xa0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built."", 'Oracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.', ""While OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future."", ""Oracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill."", ""At the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online."", ""AI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure."", ""Oracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation."", 'According to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).', ""Assuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually."", ""While Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger."", 'Remember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.', ""AI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

Since taking the reins as CEO, the aptly dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen an aggregate return in his company\'s Class A shares of 4,927,141%, as of the closing bell on March 8, 2024. That compares to a total return, including dividends paid, of around 33,500% for the S&P 500 over the same period.', ""Riding Warren Buffett's coattails has been a moneymaking strategy for decades, which is made all the easier thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors are buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for money managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management."", 'Although most investors are intrigued to see what the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying, understanding why Buffett and his team are selling certain stocks can be just as insightful.', ""Based on Berkshire's most recent 13F, Warren Buffett and his team are selling seven stocks."", ""The first sizable holding that found itself on the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is media company Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett's company pared down nearly a third of its position, which had stood at north of 93 million shares."", ""The catalyst for dumping more than 30 million shares looks to be Paramount's undesirable balance sheet. More specifically, the company is lugging around $14.6 billion in long-term debt, compared to just $2.46 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as of the end of 2023. With cord-cutting ongoing and Paramount's streaming segment still losing money, investors (including Buffett) have begun to lose patience."", ""The other side of the coin is that Paramount's streaming segment losses are lessening thanks to higher subscription prices being passed along to users. Further, legacy media companies tend to enjoy a resurgence in ad spending during major election years. Although Paramount Global clearly has concerns to address, things may not be as dire as its poor stock performance would suggest."", ""Another high-profile name that took a big haircut in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio during the fourth quarter is personal computing and printing services provider HP (NYSE: HPQ). Buffett and his aides dumped close to 78% of Berkshire's stake, compared to what was held on Sept. 30, 2023."", ""The impetus behind this selling activity may have to do with the sluggishness of personal computer (PC) sales. Though PC sales surged during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, they've meaningfully retraced with most employees returning to the office. With no sales growth forecast for the current year, HP's 3.6% dividend yield simply isn't enough of a lure to keep Buffett and his team interested."", 'HP also looks like a perfect example of a ""fair company at a wonderful price"" that Buffett would prefer to avoid. Although HP stock can be purchased for a mere 8 times forward year earnings, the company\'s growth days are long gone. Now reliant on relatively low-margin products and printing services, HP lacks the needle-moving results Berkshire\'s brightest minds desire.', 'Perhaps the most surprising selling activity during the fourth quarter was the roughly 10 million shares Buffett and his investing ""lieutenants"" parted ways with in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Keep in mind that selling 10 million shares only reduced Berkshire\'s stake in its top holding by 1.1%.', 'Chances are the Oracle of Omaha hasn\'t changed his tune on what he previously referred to as ""a better business than any we own."" Apple\'s physical product innovation has led the way for more than a decade, with the company now also emphasizing high-margin subscription services. To boot, Apple has repurchased $650.9 billion of its own common stock since the start of 2013, which is tops among public companies.', ""The most logical reason Buffett and his investing crew pared down their Apple stake is to offset realized investment losses from Paramount Global and HP. Buffett's company is sitting on an estimated $119 billion in unrealized gains on its Apple stock."", 'A popular holding that was given the heave-ho from Berkshire\'s investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter is insurance and investment company Markel Group (NYSE: MKL), which has been dubbed something of a ""mini-Berkshire"" given its penchant for making investments. Buffett and his team dumped their entire position in Markel, which had been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2022.', 'There are two educated guesses as to why Markel found itself on the chopping block. The likeliest answer is valuation. Since 2015, Markel Group had traded at or below 120% of its book value on only a handful of occasions. One of those instances was during the first quarter of 2022. With Markel\'s premium-to-book value nearing 50% just prior to the start of October 2023, the luster of getting a ""deal"" may have worn off.', ""The other possibility is Weschler or Combs, not Buffett, cut Markel loose. Buffett's investment aides are considerably more active on the trading front than he is, and this position was ultimately held less than two years."", ""Brazil-focused fintech company StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE), which had been a five-year holding in Berkshire's portfolio, was also shown the door during the fourth quarter."", ""The motivation for Buffett and his team to part ways with StoneCo probably had to do with the company's debt-driven challenges. Brazil's central bank raised interest rates to as high as 13.75% in 2022 to get the country's inflation rate under control. Unfortunately, StoneCo's loan division was backed by debt, which sent its servicing costs soaring. Even though management has addressed these issues, StoneCo is still something of a work in progress."", ""On the other hand, StoneCo has its fingers in far more than just payments in Brazil's economy. It offers banking and credit solutions, as well as software, to micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Although add-on service adoption is climbing, StoneCo has penetrated just a small fraction of the fintech market in Brazil."", ""The sixth stock Buffett and his team kicked to the curb during the December-ended quarter was longtime holding Globe Life (NYSE: GL). Prior to its departure, life and supplemental health insurance company Globe Life had been a continuous holding in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for more than two decades."", ""Valuation looks to be the most sensible reason behind Buffett & Co.'s decision to sell. Shares of the company more than doubled following the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, sending its price-to-book value to nearly 300% during the fourth quarter. At no point during the 22 years that Berkshire held shares of Globe Life did it sustain a book value of more than 200% for any length of time, let alone near 300%."", ""Buffett and his team are also known for concentrating Berkshire's investments in their top ideas. Globe Life never met the definition of a core holding, which ultimately sealed its fate."", ""Last but not least, the Oracle of Omaha and his team booted homebuilder D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter."", 'This is one of the biggest head-scratchers of all considering shares of D.R. Horton were only acquired during the June-ended quarter. Since Warren Buffett is a firm believer in holding wonderful businesses for extended periods, the purchase and subsequent sale of D.R. Horton suggests that Ted Weschler and/or Todd Combs were the masterminds behind this relatively quick trade.', ""History may also have played a role in dumping shares of D.R. Horton. Homebuilders aren't known for delivering outsized investment returns. Depending on Berkshire's entry and exit, it could have been up north of 50% on its stake in D.R. Horton in under nine months. That's an incredible gain for a traditionally slow-moving, highly cyclical industry. With various money-based metrics and predictive indicators alluding to a possible recession in 2024, locking in gains may have been prudent."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Paramount Global right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Paramount Global, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paramount Global wasn’t one of them.

On Wednesday, Caso raised his price target on Micron to $120 a share, implying that Micron stock will gain more than 30% over the next 12 months or so."", ""Historically, Micron stock has traded for about 11 times its average earnings -- a conservative multiple that's appropriate for a cyclical stock that can grow quickly when the semiconductor cycle is healthy, but also loses a lot of money during downturns. Caso argues that Micron should be worth closer to 14 times its projected 2025 earnings, though, on his assumption that Micron will earn nearly $8.40 per share next year, and potentially outearn its previous record of $11.51 per share (hit in 2018) by the time this earnings cycle peaks."", 'Is that realistic, though?', ""Micron lost money last year. It's probably going to lose money this year, too. Looking down the road, most analysts see this current cycle peaking in 2026 -- with Micron still short of earning even $7 a share (much less $12!)."", ""Caso's prediction is quite an outlier, and I'm not certain he's fully accounting for the risk that rivals with greater scale and greater market share might undercut the company on price and crimp its ability to fully take advantage of this growing market. Both South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung are several times bigger than Micron in HBM, after all.

Why Micron (MU) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160007263.html,1710432007,STORY,['MU'],"['Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock\'s recent trend in either direction. In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Micron (MU), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Micron currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for MU that show why this chipmaker shows promise as a solid momentum pick."", ""A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For MU, shares are up 2.6% over the past week while the Zacks Semiconductor Memory industry is up 2.6% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 15.07% compares favorably with the industry's 15.07% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Micron have increased 19.66% over the past quarter, and have gained 73.95% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 10.08% and 35.76%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of MU's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MU is averaging 16,252,850 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with MU.', ""Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MU's consensus estimate, increasing from -$0.44 to -$0.32 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MU is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Micron on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Our projection for the metric was $143.2 million.Revenues from non-Hasbro Branded Film & TV tumbled 54% year over year to $139.3 million due to the impact of industry strikes and non-core business exits in late 2022.

Specifically, Tower highlights YUM!

He notes that both food and labor inflation have decreased significantly in recent years. However, with regions like California implementing wage increases, Tower acknowledges that ""brands will have to price to offset that.""', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", 'JARED BLIKRE: The cost of dining out continues to outpace your weekly grocery bill. Meals at restaurants and bars cost diners 4.5% more compared to a year ago with restaurants honing in on price hikes due to persistent labor inflation. But despite those stubbornly high restaurant prices, our next guest is still bullish on fast casual names like Chipotle and Yum Brands.', ""And for more on the sector, we're joined now by Jon Tower, Citi director and restaurant analyst. So thank you for joining us here today. Break down your view for us on some of these faster restaurant names that you're covering."", ""JON TOWER: Yeah. Thanks for having me. So we're constructive on Yum, Darden, Chipotle, and a few others in the space. And effectively, there's a few things we like about them from the fast casual standpoint. We think that those businesses have fairly strong momentum, and what they're doing is carving out a category that sits obviously between full service dining and limited service dining, and attractive price point with higher quality food."", ""And those are still in their infancy in terms of where they are with respect to growth and the opportunity in the US and abroad. So we think that where they're hitting with the consumer right now, especially with respect to the demographics, they're hitting younger, they're hitting wealthier. That works really well."", ""And given the backdrop in the US at the moment where it appears as though the lower income consumer is cutting back quite a bit on their consumption away from home, perhaps pivoting to grocery as an alternative. We like brands that have momentum. You know, Yum Brands a little bit unique in that they're a global quick service operator."", ""We like them because frankly they continue to open stores across the globe. They're using franchisee capital to make this happen. And specifically what we like that's slowly emerging for them is this digital platform that they've built out, effectively creating capabilities for their franchisees that allow them to become more digitized across their system."", ""And Yum is going to be capturing more of that revenue back to themselves instead of farming it out to third parties as they previously did. And we think that's going to allow their franchisees to become more profitable, which will then fuel greater unit growth across the globe over time across the three major brands that they have. So those two Chipotle and Yum are right up there."", ""SEANA SMITH: Hey, Jon, I'm curious to get your perspective on the pricing strategy for Chipotle and Yum. How do you see that playing out going forward, given the fact that, yes, prices are obviously still higher than they were a year ago in many respects, but we're not seeing anywhere near the type of increases that we were a year ago."", ""JON TOWER: Yeah. I think the argument can be made that so long as employment and jobs continue to grow and wages continue to move in the right direction, particularly in the US, there is room for these restaurants to continue to take some modest pricing right in line with inflation. And you think about it, they're considering the cost-- the primary cost buckets are going to be food costs and labor costs."", ""And both of those-- food inflation has come down relative to where it has been in recent years, certainly labor inflation as well. However, they're still moving upward. And so the idea of these concepts going from, say, high single digit, in some cases, low double-digit pricing down to low single-digit pricing makes sense."", ""Now, obviously there's markets like California where wager rates are going to be shifting quite dramatically starting in April. And brands are going to have to price to offset that in the market. It's TBD in terms of how that plays out for demand. We're a little bit more nervous for brands that have overexposure there and haven't had strong momentum in underlying traffic going into this period of likely higher prices."", ""Could you see traffic drop off pretty dramatically in response to that? Yeah, you could. But those brands that have momentum, which means they've been giving a fairly strong consumer proposition for some time, typically good food on the plate and strong throughput, we think those brands are still going to outshine the rest of the category. That's your Chipotle, is a good example.""]"

The company’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.Moreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.Alphabet’s strong efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Also, its expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. However, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)McDonald's shares have gained +8.6% over the past year against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry’s gain of +11.6%. The company is likely to benefit from strong comps performance, marketing campaigns and a loyalty program. During fourth-quarter 2023, McDonald's U.K. solidified its position as a go-to destination for quality food at exceptional value, thus, boosting customer loyalty.McDonald's is also increasing its focus on menu innovation, as it believes that the strengthening of the core menu and solid marketing are likely to pave the way for additional growth in the upcoming periods. Also, the focus on Accelerating the Arches strategy bodes well.Earnings estimates for 2024 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ optimism about the stock’s growth potential. Yet, macroeconomic challenges and commodity and wage inflation are primary headwinds.(You can read the full research report on McDonald’s here >>>)Shares of RTX have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past six months (+21.1% vs. +12.2%). The company continues to receive ample orders from the Pentagon and its foreign allies for its wide range of combat-proven defense products.A steadily recovering commercial air traffic, both domestic and international, is expected to bolster commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for the company. RTX holds a solid financial position which should enable it to make successful share repurchase.However, the appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock. Also, as rising crude price tends to put cost pressure on airlines, operating results of commercial OEM producers like RTX may be impacted.

But chocolates, biscuits and nutribars aren’t.', 'People are prioritizing the ease and comfort of snacking in their busy lifestyles—often, even replacing entire meals for it.', ""“I think what we're seeing is the continuing, enduring power of snacking,” Nick Graham, senior vice president and global head of insights and analytics at food behemoth Mondelez, told Fortune in an interview. In its State of Snacking report for 2023, released Thursday, the Chicago-based food company studies how consumers around the world think about snacking."", 'Graham has observed that people are using snacking “increasingly as a way to provide that pleasure [and] indulgence that’s more affordable and accessible,” especially when big experiences like travel feel out of reach.', 'As the cost-of-living crisis has persisted, the snacking industry has grown in markets like the U.S., the U.K., and Germany, according to data insights firm Mintel. Mondelez’s 2023 State of Snacking report found that two-thirds of people are giving in to the so-called “snackification” movement, breaking up big meals into smaller ones spread out throughout the day. This trend has been cooking for years, accelerated by the pivot to hybrid working, but has proved its ability to endure amid rising costs.', 'The near-universal importance of snacking calls back to the “lipstick effect,” in which beauty companies like Sephora benefit from people splurging on smaller pleasures when they can’t afford big ones during periods of economic volatility.', 'Chocolates have been pitched as one of the many alternatives to lipsticks—and they also happen to be among Mondelez’s largest varieties of snacks that the company makes, with brands like Cadbury, Milka, and Toblerone.', 'The U.K.-based Savills’s Stephen Toal argued that chocolate could be the new “lipstick,” while Deloitte suggested bourbon (the whiskey) was a better alternative. The takeaway? People eat and drink their inflation-linked sorrows away, and this time, they’re turning to snacks.', 'Mondelez reported in January that its net revenue grew by 14.4% in 2023. However, its volume/mix was positive, pointing to how people were actively choosing its brand despite price hikes, a Mondelez representative told Fortune.', ""“We've seen it historically—if you go back to prior disruptions, economic recessions, et cetera, there is a bit of a ‘lipstick effect’ on things like chocolate and cookies in particular, where people use that as a way to access affordably, accessibly a bit of indulgence, a bit of pleasure when they can't necessarily afford other things,” Graham said."", 'Snacking has become the dominant force in the food industry. People are opting for snacks now more than ever before—so much so that the fraction of people globally snacking at breakfast or dinner has climbed to 58% in 2023 compared to 52% and 45%, respectively, in 2019, Mondelez found.', 'Millennials and Gen Z are at the forefront of this shift away from the sacred three-meal ritual, as they navigate busier lifestyles and the need to find newer experiences through food. In its snacking report, Mondelez surveyed over 3,600 people across 12 countries and found that the “experience economy” was a big driver for people as snacking presented a moment of escape for consumers.', ""“We see this real desire for novel experiences—something that's a little bit out of the ordinary,” Graham said. He gave the example of Cadbury's tropical pineapple-flavored chocolate and exotic Oreo flavors in China as ones that consumers sought."", 'It’s also becoming increasingly important, Graham said, to design snacks for the health-conscious shopper, offering nutritional benefits with a dash of guilt, while still being affordable.', ""“One of the main ones for us is also making sure that we're hitting a magic price point for consumers because while we're all having to deal with the cost of living… We also know that for many consumers, particularly on lower incomes, there's just a certain price point that they're not able to afford [going] above,” Graham said."", 'Costs have gone up on the business end, too, which has caused “shrinkflation” across different grocery aisles. Mondelez has shrunk some of its product sizes and jacked up prices as ingredient costs like cocoa and sugar have soared in the last few years. While some of these moves came from the brand, Graham says consumers too have been asking for smaller packets to control their portion sizes.', 'Mondelez, like other big food companies, plans to continue increasing prices as inflation remains elevated. But in the meantime, snacking in every shape and form will reign supreme.', ""“I think we'll start to see people using snacking as not just ‘I'm going to fill this gap’ but actually really as a positive food choice to supplement their diet,” Graham said."", 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

At the same time, the Company is among the top three players in segments that include biscuits, cake, pastries, and snack bars. Therefore, Mondelez has a big, addressable market and a strong brand portfolio.', 'Another reason to like Mondelez is the focus on emerging markets. For 2022, Mondelez reported 39% revenue from EMs. In the last four years, revenue growth in Ems has been at a CAGR of 10.7% compared to a CAGR of 3.8% in developed markets.', 'I must add that Mondelez reported a free cash flow of $3.6 billion last year.

However, a look inside Warren Buffett-led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway's\xa0stock portfolio might reveal some of the most interesting opportunities for long-term investors right now."", ""With that in mind, here are three of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio that all look attractive right now and have lots of room to grow and produce market-beating returns in the years to come."", 'If you rewind the clocks to the start of 2023, few investing experts were giving homebuilders a fighting chance. But they were wrong. In fact, with existing home inventories at a generational low and homebuilders able to offer excellent mortgage incentives, it created an extremely strong environment for new-home sales.', ""Berkshire bought shares of three homebuilders in 2023, and the most exciting one may be NVR (NYSE: NVR). If you aren't familiar with the company, NVR uses a land-light model."", ""Unlike most builders, the company doesn't buy large quantities of land. Instead, it buys purchase options on building lots and doesn't buy them until it has a home under contract. This frees up more capital to grow the business."", 'In the fourth quarter, the company reported an impressive 25% year-over-year increase in new orders and a 12% increase in its backlog. Homebuilding revenue declined slightly year over year but not nearly by as much as experts were projecting at the beginning of the year.', ""With this amount of order growth, the future looks strong. Even though shares are up 67% year over year, NVR's valuation of just 16x forward earnings in a still-strong environment for new-home sales looks extremely reasonable."", ""If someone had told you 20 years ago that General Motors' financial arm would become one of the top online banks in the U.S., you might not have believed them. But Ally Financial (NYSE: ALLY), which was spun off from GM in the wake of the financial crisis, has done just that."", ""Because of the company's roots, it shouldn't be a surprise that the biggest part of Ally's business is auto lending. But there's so much more to this company. It has an excellent consumer deposit platform that has $155 billion in total deposits, a variety of other loan types, a brokerage platform, and much more."", ""Berkshire owns just under 10% of Ally, and it isn't hard to see why. This is a highly profitable business. Its average auto loan in 2023 was originated with a 10.7% yield."", ""The bank's average cost of funding (mostly deposits) is 4.35%, even with a reasonable amount of loan defaults, which leaves a pretty solid margin. Plus, that cost of funding could come down significantly if interest rates start to fall this year, as is widely expected."", ""For 2023, Ally's 3.35% net interest margin was one of the best in banking. With the stock trading for 12x forward earnings, it could be a bargain."", ""One of the more recent financial stocks added to Berkshire's portfolio, Capital One (NYSE: COF) could be an interesting opportunity for long-term investors, especially with its pending acquisition of Discover (NYSE: DFS)."", ""The deal will combine two of the largest credit card issuers in the United States, which will create some major cost advantages. Capital One expects $2.7 billion in annual synergies from the deal by 2027, and its banking infrastructure could be an asset to Discover's banking products, which currently operate entirely online."", ""However, the real potential could be Capital One owning one of the four major payment networks. Discover is a distant fourth right now but could have massive growth potential under Capital One. Not only could the bank eventually move much of its own debit and credit card products to Discover's network, but it also can afford to invest more heavily in growing the network than Discover could on its own."", ""Even though they're near a 52-week high, Capital One shares are trading for an 8% discount to their book value and just 10x forward earnings. With the possibilities created by the Discover acquisition, Capital One is worthy of a closer look right now."", 'These are all rock-solid companies that are among the leaders in their respective industries (homebuilding, online banking, credit card lending), and all three have lots of room to grow.

Kimbell', ""Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy. Our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year. A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies and new fulfillment and technology capabilities, enabled our teams to deliver mid-single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling, which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share of voice and strong social engagement. These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopper -- shopping frequency and retention. From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, according to Circana data. Our marketing share -- our market share of prestige beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continue to face pressure from the expansion of beauty -- distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest-growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BIOMA, Bubble and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continue to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica and Cetaphil. The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Newness from Valentino, Burberry and Tree Hut and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci and Billie Eilish contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand, to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. Comp sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts. And brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f., NYX and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, NATASHA DENONA and Pat McGrath continue to engage guests. And HOURGLASS, Tarte and Lancôme saw success with compelling holiday offerings. Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on silane and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with OUAI, Mielle and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and LolaVie also resonated with guests. Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, texture services and ear piercing, drove strong engagement with guests. Turning now to the full year. Net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%. Operating profit was 15% of sales. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one Conscious Beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed to the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our MUSE Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guest about new products, new techniques and the latest beauty trends. We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores. Between BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship-from-store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement of labs guests and greater loyalty account linkage as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand-building efforts resulted in record level unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements and deliver future profitable growth. I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform. And we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. We built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities. And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. Our teams enable our success, and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong. Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last 3 years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit range, barring a major economic event. Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve and expand All Things Beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. In addition, this year, we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our conscious beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify Luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment and engaging services and events while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization and optimizing our store teams. We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement. And we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media and overall e-commerce efforts. Our supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center, and we began the retrofit of our remaining full-service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhanced associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. Turning to our final strategic pillar. We intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact. Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our road map to achieve our emission reduction goals. Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly. And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands, to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023 while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates and the communities we serve. Now as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call. And I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. Now today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?"", 'Scott M. Settersten', ""Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. Average ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase. Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lap the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated 2, remodeled 2 stores and closed 2 stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions and royalties earned through our Target partnership. At the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year but continues to be well below 2019 levels. Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. Moving to expenses. SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A. And diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina as well as the impact of product cost increases. Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $124 million for IT; $73 million for supply chain; and $60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward."", 'Paula Oyibo', ""Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share 2 capital allocation update. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retain flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures and support core traffic and experienced drivers. In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins. Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures; $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.', 'Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh', ""Also, Scott, best wishes on retirement. So I wanted to start out just with the prestige cosmetics category. As you look towards this fiscal year, we're seeing a lot of newness in stores. You're moving past, I think, pretty difficult comparisons. So just curious if you guys expect to return to share gains within the prestige cosmetics category."", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Rupesh, thanks for your question, and thanks for calling out, Scott, well deserved. Yes. I'll say on makeup, and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all our categories, we are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023, particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business. It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. Our efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently, also exclusive brands like Half Magic and Polite Society, Rabanne, innovation from our existing big brands that we'll continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lancôme on the prestige side. Our luxury proposition really launched last year to -- with a lot of success. And as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then through our holistic efforts, we're going to try to find ways to lean into the important trends. Makeup is -- of course, has a key trend component. So whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail is an important opportunity, we're going to continue to drive that. And the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration, the number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business. We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer with Piper Sandler.', 'Korinne N. Wolfmeyer', ""Congrats on the quarter. I'd like to touch a little bit on the decision to enter into Mexico. I mean previously, we've been talking about potentially going into Canada. Just would like to understand your thought process of going or doing Mexico versus Canada. And what kind of opportunity do you really see there over the longer term?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""I'm just going to say we're really excited about this announcement and really, as I said in the prepared remarks, see Mexico as a great opportunity that's tailor-made for the Ulta Beauty experience. Kecia is leading this effort among many things that she does. So I'm going to ask Kecia to give some more color on it."", 'Kecia L. Steelman', ""Yes, absolutely. Well, after careful evaluation of many market opportunities, we really felt like the Mexican market is the next step for Ulta Beauty for us to have this partnership with Axo. And we're really excited about this. I know that the future is going to be really bright in this partnership. We've spent a lot of time with their teams from a cultural perspective, also just even from the best-in-class performance with global partners that they've brought to the Mexico consumer -- the Mexican consumer. Our border stores are performing really, really well. And I just think it's the next natural step for us as we continue to expand internationally. So we are really excited about this. Again, we are planning to be operational in 2025. The cost of this is built into the guidance in '24. So we don't feel like it's very material. But we're super excited and feel that Axo is the right partner for us to launch in this next new territory for us."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.', 'Juliana Duque', ""This is Juliana on for Ike. I just wanted to ask in regards to thoughts on the beauty categories moving forward, particularly the balance of prestige and mass, and maybe in addition, how we can see that driving merchandise margin given the benefit that we've seen."", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Well, for the overall category, as I mentioned in the remarks, we're fortunate to be in a category that continues to be healthy, that is highly connected to our consumers, a high level of engagement, that there's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time, and then certainly coming out of COVID, has been exceptionally strong. All indicators, as we look at the consumer landscape, is a continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing for consumer behavior to continue to evolve. We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. And what we've seen in this category is strong growth, but as expected, some moderation in that growth. Still above historical trends but some moderation. Simply put, we think consumers, highly engaged in the category but still -- and still passionate about the category but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. And as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well positioned to manage through really any kind of economic disruption or challenge given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressure or have other changes. But overall, category healthy. Paula, as it relates to any potential margin changes?"", 'Paula Oyibo', ""Yes. What I would say is our merchandise margin, I would remind, we are meaningfully higher and better, our merchandise margin since 2019. And really that has a lot to do with we are a much healthier business now, and we have -- our mix in our business between our categories as well as prestige and mass through category performance efforts over the years has really helped us be able to be flexible as the consumer shifts between various categories as well as between mass and prestige. And so we believe that our -- we're able to manage that dynamic."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity.', 'Susan Kay Anderson', ""I wanted to maybe ask about the store expansion. It looks like it picks up this year. I guess how should we think about timing throughout the year? And then also, should we expect these to be the full-size stores? Or are you going to roll out any of the smaller test stores that you've been looking at? And then also, just how do you think this helps to maybe win back some of the share from other competition?"", 'Paula Oyibo', ""Thanks, Susan. We are planning to open between 60 and 65 net new stores in fiscal 2024. That puts our growth between the 2-year period at 90 to 95, which is generally in line with the 100 that we had communicated. And so our thinking hasn't materially changed there. We remain confident in our ability to open and operate between 1,500 and 1,700 traditional Ulta Beauty freestanding locations in the U.S. And we're optimistic the small format store prototype could give us an opportunity for additional growth, as does the partnership with Target and then similarly as we're excited about the additional opportunity with our international expansion into Mexico. Related to the small geographies, we are planning to open 10 small store formats in 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Helgans with Jefferies.', 'Ashley Elizabeth Helgans', 'So we just wanted to ask for an update on UB Media. Anything you can share about the number of brands that are currently on the platform, maybe demand for the platform? And then any color to help us model as UB starts to scale?', 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes. We're really pleased with the progress that we've made. As a reminder for those on the call, this really does represent a way for us to generate positive impact on our business by leveraging the first-party data and insights that we have in partnering with our brands. We're not sharing, we haven't shared and we don't plan to share specific on a number of brands or even specific financial impact at this time. But what I will say is we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in 2023 and are confident that we'll continue to grow this part of the business. The network that we have offers advertising access via off-site display, video, social influencers as well as on-site sponsored products. Our on-site display inventory is one of the actually new core offerings that we activated just in 2023. So we've got a full suite of ad inventory experiences, value-added services. And as I said, we're confident in its impact going forward. And the support, engagement, reaction from brands has been very positive. As you know, the advertising world continues to evolve. So the value that we can bring through first-party data with 43 million beauty enthusiasts is very meaningful. And we continue to work with our brand partners, and they have demonstrated to us that they see a positive return. And we're continuing to grow that business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.', 'Olivia Tong Cheang', ""Congrats, Scott, and looking forward to working with you, Paula. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on new product contribution this year because it does seem like certainly starting off with the momentum with Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro. We did some store tours in New York recently, and the team is very energized around these brands. So was wondering if you could talk about contribution this year versus previous years and then helping us understand sort of -- I think you mentioned Sol de Janeiro that -- a portion of the doors. Maybe can you give the same statistics for Charlotte Tilbury? And then on the margin, I would just love a little bit more detail in terms of what's driving the margin outlook to the 14% to 14.3% end of the longer-term range, whether there's anything, sort of higher investment or what have you that's sort of dragging that to that end of the range?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Okay. Thanks, Olivia. Yes, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline, and then Paula can pick up on your question around margins. So we're -- well, first, I'll say newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales. And that's an important part of the category and one of the best things about the category. There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiast guests from our members to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories. And so we do have what I believe is a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big, recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment. And so we don't -- we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year. But I will give you a couple of highlights. First, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. And just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online, and we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members, and we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in-store and online and has been very well received since we launched that in January. But there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands. And while I'm not going to, for competitive reasons, share some in the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year like LolaVie, Polite Society, Half Magic, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit, important brands playing an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about. And our luxury business that I talked about, we continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. So newness is important. We see -- we like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far, and I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question?"", 'Paula Oyibo', 'Yes. So from an operating margin perspective, we shared 14% to 14.3% of sales. And that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformation agenda and move to investments to enable growth as well as we operationalize the investments that we made to date and those go into one state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in the guidance. And we also will continue to support core traffic and experienced drivers. And so as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single-digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenue.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson.', 'Michael Allen Baker', ""Really just a follow-up on what you just said. The -- can you tell us where you are in this investment -- these foundational investments? I think you said $62 million in 2023, which was below plan, and shift some into 2024. So what should it be in 2024? And even working backwards, can you remind us what it was in '21 and 2022? It was sort of supposed to have a 3-year investment plan that is rolling off. It sounds like it's still rolling off and -- although there will be some lingering costs in 2024. So just trying to conceptualize what 2024 investments will look like versus 2023."", 'Paula Oyibo', ""Yes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So we had an incremental $55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated $62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda. Think about Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT projects. But as I communicated, once we complete those particular systems, these upgraded systems roll into our core operations and become a part of our base, and there's run costs associated to that. So there is run cost associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures and investing in traffic and experienced drivers. Kecia?"", 'Kecia L. Steelman', ""Yes. So in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are in the projects for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR, just this week, we completed our Dallas DC. And we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MFC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville before peak this year. Part of the ERP upgrade, we're also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems. And we have those plans to be completed before the second half, again prior to peak. For supply chain in '24, we are continuing to invest in our automation capabilities. And I mentioned already the MFC in Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas -- the Dallas DC. And then for the Digital Store of the Future, so our Digital Store platform, we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024. And we're wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities. So bottom line, we continue to be on track and on our budget, and we are all in on wrapping these foundational enabling systems up this year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets.', 'Anthony Chinonye Chukumba', ""Let me add my congratulations to Scott as well. It's been a pleasure working with you all these years. So my question was on the luxury brands. I guess just 2 parts to the same question, both pretty quick. First off, how did they perform relative to your expectations in 2024? And what are your expectations in terms of additional brand rollouts -- luxury brand rollouts in 20 -- sorry, in 2023? And then what are your expectations for additional luxury brand rollouts in 2024?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Great. Well, thanks for the question. And yes, luxury, as I said, was one of our -- one of many initiatives last year to drive engagement. And we're really pleased with establishing that more firmly with some of our existing partners, including Chanel, but Dior, NATASHA DENONA, Pat McGrath. And so we see strong performance, and we're really pleased with how our guests are engaging in that part of the business. We had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like Chanel. And then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe, met our guests' needs. And they're excited about it. And it further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty from all price points, including luxury. We're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today. More broadly, as I said, with newness, we have a steady stream of newness throughout the year, and we'll continue to innovate. Specifically within luxury, our focus is continuing to grow in partnership with the brands that we've launched and find new ways to expand those businesses and delight our guests with them. And we're really pleased and proud to have that experience in our stores."", 'Kiley F. Rawlins', 'Operator, can we have the last question, please?', 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays.', 'Adrienne Eugenia Yih-Tennant', ""Scott, congratulations. It's been great, and thanks for all the help over the years. This question is maybe for Dave or Kecia. Can you talk about the promotional environment that your guidance is under for 2024? Is it expected to sort of remain in maybe the first half and then abate or kind of preexist all year long and whether it was more from prestige? Are you concerned that there perhaps is a longer-term shift to mass or masstige from younger or more price-sensitive consumers? And then Scott and Paula, just a quick one. In your 4% to 5% comp, what are you expecting in terms of any ASP increases this year? And what's the rationale behind the low single-digit to mid-single-digit comp in the back half? What's going to drive the acceleration?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""So yes, just on the promotional environment, what -- I probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify or become irrational. We are in a competitive environment. That's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position. So as we look forward, we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to drive our business, which includes marketing, store labor, digital experiences and promotional activity as appropriate. But not an expectation more broadly for a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it will still remain well below 2019 levels. The mass to mass prestige question, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged, and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige. They're loving our luxury experience. So it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win and -- regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the 4% to 5%?"", 'Paula Oyibo', 'Sure. Adrienne, on your question with regards to expectation around ASP, what I would share is that we are planning for a more normalized pricing environment in 2024.', 'David C. Kimbell', ""Great. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'd like to close by thanking our 55,000 associates for delivering a strong 2023. Together, I know we will continue to unleash the unique power of beauty and keep moving our business forward in exciting ways. I'm optimistic about the future of Ulta Beauty and confident we will continue to create significant shareholder value. I do want to take 1 second to thank Scott again. Scott, as I said, has been an amazing partner to all of us, and I so appreciate his impact and his leadership. And I want to thank those on the call that have the chance to thank him yourself. I know he loved spending time in all of our meetings and all of our earnings calls. It was -- I know he appreciated partnership with all of you, and I do want to thank Scott for everything you've done for our company. Thank you, Scott. We look forward to speaking to all of you again when we report results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on May 30. Thank you again, and have a great night."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

Dave?"", 'Dave Kimbell -- Chief Executive Officer', 'Thank you, Kiley, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter with sales, operating margin, and EPS, all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy, our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention.', 'For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5%, driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high-teen growth last year.', 'A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies, and new fulfillment and technology capabilities enabled our teams to deliver mid single-digit comp growth for the holiday period. Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling which inspired authentic connection, leading to record breaking impressions, significant growth in share voice, and strong social engagement. These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing view detainment to guests and building the basket.', 'Compelling content, combined with successful promotional strategies, drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation, while increasing shopping frequency and retention. From a market share perspective, we continued to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3rd, 2024, according to Circana data. Our market share of Prestige Beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continued to face pressure from the expansion of beauty distribution points in Prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term.', 'Turning to performance by category, skincare was our fastest growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like BYOMA, Bubble, and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to appeal to consumers, looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica, and Cetaphil. The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter.', 'Newness from Valentino, Burberry, and Tree Hut, and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites, YSL, Gucci, and Billie Eilish, contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. Pump sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range.', ""Softness in prestige cosmetics was partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continue to resonate with beauty enthusiasts, and brands leaning into these trends, including e.l.f., NYX, and exclusive brand, Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth. While prestige makeup was challenged in totality as we lapped strong growth last year, luxury brands, Dior, Natasha Denona, and Pat McGrath, continued to engage guests, and Hourglass, Tarte, and Lancome saw success with compelling holiday offerings. Finally, comp sales for the haircare category decreased in the mid single-digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022."", 'Products focused on styling and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands, Redken, Kenra, and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with Wahl, Mielle, and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and LolaVie, also resonated with guests. Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings including extensions, hair treatments, texture services, and ear piercing drove strong engagement with guests.', 'Turning now to the full year, net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion, comp sales increased 5.7%, operating profit was 15% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms.', 'Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touch points, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry. We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beautycounter, and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands including HALF MAGIC and Polite Society. We launched luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms.', 'We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one conscious beauty pillar and continue to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands and welcome to the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our MUSE Accelerator program, a program designed to help early stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness. Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. Turning to our second strategic pillar, all in your world, we improved the guest experience across all of our touch points.', 'We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services, while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guests about new products, new techniques, and the latest beauty trends. We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience.', 'We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive the omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in e-commerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy-anywhere-fill-anywhere capabilities. We expanded same-day delivery to all stores and increased our ship-from-store capabilities to 450 stores.', 'Between BOPIS, same day delivery and ship from store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year. Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations, ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, reengagement of lapsed guests, and greater loyalty account linkage, as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community.', 'Our marketing strategies, media investments, and brand building efforts resulted in record-level unaided awareness, brand love, and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched The Joy Project, a multi-year brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trendsetting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment, and share a voice. And we achieved an important milestone.', 'In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition, and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leaning into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members. We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them.', 'Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products, and launched an innovative omnichannel solution, which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization, to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements, and deliver future profitable growth. I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty.', 'We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution center, opened our Greer market fulfillment center, and began work on our Bolingbrook market fulfillment center. We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville, Greer, and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform. And we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. We built a new enterprise data platform on Google Cloud infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities.', 'And we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. Our teams enable our success, and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year, we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering, and completed enterprisewide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias. Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers, and our corporate team.', 'And our 2023 culture survey results reinforce that our overall associate engagement remains strong. Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofits, and energy management system upgrades, and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the Science-Based Target initiative. I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023.', 'Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace, and I am grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders while also enabling new capabilities for future growth. As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last three years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth. In 2024, we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid single-digit range, barring a major economic event.', 'Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year, we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects while also investing in core traffic and experienced drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve, and expand all things beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast. To strengthen our differentiated position, we will continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury, while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced.', 'In addition, this year, we will refresh ULTA Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our Conscious Beauty platform. And we will continue to enhance and amplify luxury at Ulta Beauty and our cross-category platforms. Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touch points. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels, and relocations.', 'In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment, and engaging services and events, while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization, and optimizing our store teams. We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion, and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty at Target shops, evolve the assortment, and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement.', 'To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify The Joy Project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program. We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition, while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips, and encourage omnichannel engagement. And we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media.', 'Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts. In fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including Project SOAR, digital store, and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new MarTech stack to support our personalization, retail media, and overall e-commerce efforts. Our supply chain optimization journey will continue as our Bolingbroke market fulfillment center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas distribution center, and we begin the retrofit of our remaining in Chambersburg and Fresno.', 'In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhance associate learning and development, and deepen our DDI impact. Turning to our final strategic pillar, we intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact.', 'Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement a roadmap to achieve our emission reduction goals. Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the U.S. International expansion represents an incremental long term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico.', 'The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing, and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts, and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset-light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly, and I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024.', ""For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023, while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities, and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates, and the communities we serve."", ""Now, as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call. Now, I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. Now, today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1st."", 'Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?', 'Scott Settersten -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo, who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line, reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue, and healthy traffic trends, as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2%, driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue, as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.', 'Net sales for the 53rd week were 181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions. Average ticket declined 1.9%, driven by lower units per transaction, which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment, we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall comp increase.', 'Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December, reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lapped the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated two, remodeled two stores, and closed two stores. For the quarter, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales.', 'The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates, and leverage of supply chain costs, which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin. Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions, and royalties earned through our Target partnership. At the same time, we realized benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality, as well as the impact from brand mix.', 'These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year but continues to be well below 2019 levels. Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor, and new fragrance fixtures. For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points.', ""Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 7.6% to 820 million. Overall, SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses and store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance."", 'In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses. While store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleveraged during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, digital store, and other IT capabilities, and UB Media. For the full year, we invested 62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024.', ""Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives, as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes."", 'Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to 11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7%, driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket.', 'We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales, with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A, and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to 1.7 billion compared to 1.6 billion last year.', 'In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina; as well as the impact of product cost increases. Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly 1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth, followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders.', ""In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately 178 million for new stores, remodels, and merchandise fixtures, 124 million for IT, 73 million for supply chain, and 60 million for store maintenance and other. Depreciation for the year was 244 million compared to 241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352,000 shares at a cost of 159 million, bringing total share repurchase to 1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning 5.8 billion to shareholders, while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers."", ""Before I turn the call over to Paula, I wanna take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty. It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward."", 'Paula Oyibo -- Senior Vice President, Finance', ""Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of chief financial officer at Ulta Beauty, and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met."", 'Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share two capital allocation updates. First, yesterday, we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retained flexibility to upsize the capacity if needed. Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization for 2 billion.', 'Now, turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024. We expect next sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid single-digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures, and support core traffic and experience drivers.', 'In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single-digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid single-digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share.', 'We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single-digit growth in the second half of the year. For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter, with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margins. Finally, we plan to spend between 415 million and 490 million in capex, including approximately 270 million to 282 million for new stores, remodels, and merchandise fixtures; 120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT; and 45 million to 53 million for store maintenance and others. We expect appreciation for the year will be between 275 million to 280 million.', ""We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright, and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook. We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A."", '', 'Operator', '[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.', 'Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', 'Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. And also, Scott, best wishes in retirement. So, I wanted to start out just with the prestige cosmetics category.', ""As you look toward this fiscal year, you know, we're seeing a lot of news in stores. You're moving past, I think, pretty difficult comparisons. Just curious if you guys expect to return to share games within the prestige cosmetics category."", 'Dave Kimbell -- Chief Executive Officer', ""Rupesh, thanks for your question and thanks for calling out Scott, well-deserved. Yeah, I'll say on makeup and I'll even speak a little bit more broadly across all of our categories, you know, we are focused on driving growth in every part of our business. Our makeup business in 2023, you know, particularly in the second half, we saw healthy growth on the mass side and more challenges on the prestige side. So, we have a strategy to drive performance within all parts of our makeup business."", ""It is our largest segment and obviously important in the beauty category. You know, our efforts are holistic. We've got a number of new brands that we believe will either already are or will add value to the category, including the launch of Charlotte Tilbury, which just rolled out recently, also, exclusive brands like HALF MAGIC and Polite Society, Rabanne; innovation from newness -- from our existing big brands that will continue to see that have been so important to our business like Tarte and Benefit and Clinique and Lancome. On the prestige side, our luxury, you know, proposition really launched last year at two -- with a lot of success."", ""And as we continue to grow and build our presence in that space, we see that as a contributor. And then, through our holistic efforts we're going to try to find ways to lean into, you know, the important trends. Makeup is, of course, has a key trend component. So, whether it's blush, shade, proliferation, lip layering, matte makeup, nail, it's an important opportunity."", ""We're going to continue to drive that. And the last thing I'd say is we continue to revamp and elevate our events that play an important role in mass migration. The number of mass consumers that we've acquired over the years, continuing to introduce them to prestige for the first time. So we're focused on driving that business."", ""We are confident over time that we'll be able to deliver the growth that we expect, and we're working hard to deliver across all parts of that business."", 'Rupesh Parikh -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst', ""Great.

There's an emotional connection that's driving the category and has been for a very long time and then, certainly, coming out of COVID has been exceptionally strong. All indicators, as we look at the at the consumer landscape is continued level of engagement. When we look into this year, though, of course, we are evaluating and anticipating and preparing, you know, for consumer behavior to continue to evolve."", ""We know there's external pressures on the consumer. We know we're entering into a dynamic time with an election year. And what we've seen in this category is strong growth but, as expected, some moderation in that growth. Still above historical trends, but is some moderation."", ""You know, simply put, we think consumers, highly engaged in the category but still -- you know, and still passionate about the category but will continue to be thoughtful in all of their spending. But fortunately, we know that beauty is an important one. And as a reminder, Ulta Beauty is well-positioned to manage through really kind of economic disruption or challenge, given our unique portfolio, all price points, all categories that allow us to meet our consumers' needs if there is a time that they feel more pressured to have other changes.

Good afternoon. And congrats, Scott, and looking forward to working with you, Paula.', ""I wanted to ask you a little bit about your thoughts on new product contribution this year because it does seem like, you know, certainly starting off with some momentum with Charlotte Tilbury and Sol de Janeiro. We did some store tours in New York recently, and the team is very energized around these brands. So, I was wondering if you could talk about contribution this year versus previous years and then helping us understand, you know, sort of -- I think you mentioned Sol de Janeiro that -- portion of the doors. Maybe can you give the same statistics for Charlotte Tilbury? And then, on the margin, I would just love a little bit more detail in terms of what's driving the margin outlook to the, you know, 14 to 14.3 end of the longer-term range, whether there's anything, you know, sort of higher investment or what have you that sort of dragging that to that end of the range."", 'Thank you.', 'Dave Kimbell -- Chief Executive Officer', ""OK, thanks, Olivia. Yeah, I'll talk about new product at our newness pipeline, and then Paula can pick up on your question around margin. So, yeah, we're -- you know, well, first, I'll say, newness is always a critical part of our business and historically has been between 20% to 30% of our sales. And that's an important part of the category, and one of the best things about the category."", ""There is a large desire from our beauty enthusiasts guests, from our members, to discover what's new and exciting across all of our categories. And so, we do have, what I believe is, a well-balanced portfolio of new brands between big recognized brands like Charlotte Tilbury, as well as a steady stream of emerging brands that are unique or exciting within the Ulta Beauty environment. And so, we don't -- we're not going to give any specific numbers about newness this year versus last year. But I will give you a couple of highlights."", ""First, you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. And just to reiterate, that is in 600 stores and online. And we're excited about that. It was one of the top requested brands from our members."", ""And we're pleased to be partnering with them to bring a unique and powerful experience to life. Sol de Janeiro is in 700 stores and also online, and also was highly requested and brings just a terrific experience in store and online and has been very well-received since we launched that in January. But there's a whole range of products that we're going to continue to launch and bring to life. We do focus, as I said, on emerging brands."", ""And while I'm not going to, for competitive reasons, share some of the pipeline that are ahead of us, I'd highlight some of the brands that we launched last year like LolaVie, Polite Society, HALF MAGIC, a brand like Live Tinted, which has been with us for a little bit. Important brands play an exciting role in driving growth in various categories that we're excited about. In our luxury business that I talked about, you know, we continue to add brands to that throughout the year and see growth. So, newness is important."", ""We see -- we like the balance that we have. We're excited about the brands that we've launched so far. And I look forward to rolling out more partnerships and bringing newness across our portfolio throughout 2024. Paula, on the margin question?"", 'Paula Oyibo -- Senior Vice President, Finance', ""Yes, so from an operating margin perspective, we shared 14% to 14.3% of sales. And that is mostly deleverage coming from SG&A as we complete many of our foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, as well as we operationalize the investments that we've made to date. And those go into run state. We also are managing ongoing wage pressures, which is assumed in a guidance, and we also will continue to support core traffic and experience drivers."", 'And so, as you think about SG&A growth for the year, it will moderate into the high single-digit range from the 12.5% growth we saw in fiscal 2023. And then, we do expect gross margin to be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage from supply chain costs are partially offset by the growth we see and expect in other revenues.', 'Kiley Rawlins -- Vice President, Investor Relations', 'Operator, can we have the next question?', 'Operator', 'Of course.

Really, just to follow up on what you just said, can you tell us where you are in this investment in these foundational investments? I think you said $62 million in 2023, which was below plan and shift some into 2024. So, what should it be in 2024? And even working backwards, can you remind us what it was in '21 and 2022? It was sort of supposed to be a three-year investment plan that was rolling off. Sounds like it's still rolling off and there'll be some lingering costs in 2024."", 'So, just trying to conceptualize, you know, what 2024 investments will look like versus 2023. Thank you.', 'Paula Oyibo -- Senior Vice President, Finance', ""Yes, Michael, I'll start with some of the numbers and then turn it over to Kecia so she can give a little bit more flavor for where we are. So, we had incremental 55 million in 2022 related to our transformational strategic investments. We communicated 62 million incremental in 2023. As you think about 2024, we expect limited incremental investment as we complete the foundational elements of our transformational agenda."", ""Think about Project SOAR, digital store, and other IT projects. But as I communicated, once we complete those particular systems, these upgraded systems roll into our core operations and become a part of our base, and there's run costs associated with that. So, there is run costs associated with those foundational investments. We will continue to invest to enable growth, as well as the other items that I mentioned regarding wage pressures in investing in traffic and experience drivers."", 'Kecia?', 'Kecia Steelman -- Chief Operating Officer', ""Yeah, so in regards to like where we are on the investments and where we are on the projects, for our ERP upgrade or what we're internally calling as Project SOAR, just this week, we completed our Dallas DC, and we have plans to wrap up Greenwood and Fresno and open up our new MSC in Bolingbrook, which is a relocation of the existing FFC in Romeoville all before peak this year. Part of the ERP upgrade, we're also transitioning our store systems and our merchandising systems, and we have those plans to be completed before the second half. Again, prior to peak. For supply chain in '24, we're continuing to invest in our automation capabilities."", ""And I mentioned already, the MSC in Bolingbrook hits on our supply chain lines, and then also finishing out that retrofit in Dallas, the Dallas DC. And then, for the Digital Store of the Future, so our digital store platform, we expect that to be completed in the first half of 2024, and we're wrapping up all of our upgrades around our analytical tools and reporting capabilities.

We had a lot of confidence going in because of existing relationships with brands like CHANEL, then by elevating and expanding it, it has really, we believe, met our guest needs. And they're excited about it and further demonstrates our ability to deliver all things beauty from all price points, including luxury. You know, we're not sharing any specific launches of anything beyond what I've already shared today."", ""More broadly, as I said with newness, we have a steady stream of newness throughout the year, and we'll continue to innovate.

It's been great, and thanks for all the help over the years."", ""This question is maybe for Dave or Kecia. Can you talk about the promotional environment that your guidance is under for 2024? Is it expected to sort of remain in maybe the first half and then abate or kind of pre-exist all year long? And whether it was from more from prestige? Are you concerned that there, perhaps, is a longer-term shift to mass or mass-stige from younger or more price-sensitive consumers? And then, Scott and Paula, just a quick one, in your four to five comp, what are you expecting in terms of any ASP increases this year? And what's the rationale behind the low single-digit to mid single-digit comp in the back half, what's going to drive the acceleration? Thank you very much."", 'Dave Kimbell -- Chief Executive Officer', ""So, yeah, just on the promotional environment, what I would -- you know, probably won't answer every one of your detailed questions because we're not going to break it out that way exactly. What I'll say more broadly is, you know, we're not expecting that the promotional environment is going to significantly intensify or become irrational. We are in a competitive environment, that's for sure. And we are focused on ensuring that we're delivering on our leadership position."", ""So, as we look forward we would anticipate and we have in our plans the ability to, you know, drive our business, which includes marketing store labor, digital experiences, and promotional activity as appropriate, but, you know, not an expectation more broadly for, you know, a significant step. And we do anticipate, as we saw in 2023, that it'll still remain well below 2019 levels. The mass to mass prestige question, we see opportunity across both parts of the business. Yes, consumers are engaged and young consumers are engaged in mass, but they're also engaged in prestige."", ""They're loving our luxury experience. So, it's really not so much about price or promotion necessarily as what brand is really delivering great innovation, great marketing, engaging with them in social media. Those brands will win regardless of the price points. Paula, do you want to give a little color on some of the four to five?"", 'Paula Oyibo -- Senior Vice President, Finance', 'Sure.

Now, investors’ eyes are on the upcoming Fed FOMC meeting scheduled for Mar 19-20. While no rate cut is anticipated, market participants are eagerly awaiting the post-FOMC statements from the Fed Chairman to decide their next moves.Regarding indicators of economic growth, there are conflicting signals. Even after a significant decrease from its peak of 9% in June 2022, inflation remains elevated compared to the Fed’s target of 2%. Personal spending continues to demonstrate resilience, despite the Fed's adherence to a restrictive monetary policy, which includes higher interest rates.

Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures a winning option on your hands.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength.

Impressively, its rotor design allows the Chinook to fly at up to 20,000 feet, higher than other helicopters in its class.Thanks to such remarkable features, BA’s CH-47 helicopter enjoys a solid demand in the combat helicopter market.

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC (AMS:CCEP)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners is:', '21% = €1.7b ÷ €8.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each €1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made €0.21 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has a higher ROE than the average (9.2%) in the Beverage industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here."", 'Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.', ""Coca-Cola Europacific Partners does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.45. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.', 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.', 'In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.', ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. We can see that in the last three years Coca-Cola grew its EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up."", ""It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. EBIT margins for Coca-Cola remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 6.4% to US$46b. That's encouraging news for the company!"", ""The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers."", ""In investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Coca-Cola's forecast profits?"", ""Owing to the size of Coca-Cola, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.8b. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Coca-Cola but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", 'As previously touched on, Coca-Cola is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. Even so, be aware that  Coca-Cola is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...', ""There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

That means you should design your portfolio for success over time, not just during one market environment."", 'How do you do that? By diversifying across industries -- and including some dividend stocks in your portfolio.', ""Dividend stocks are particularly attractive because they pay you yearly no matter what the market is doing. In bad times, they'll limit your losses, and in good times, they'll add to your winnings. These are players that could help your portfolio shine in just about any environment, so any time is the right time to invest in them."", 'There are many dividend stocks out there, but two, in particular, are fantastic to double up on right now.', 'Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a classic dividend stock that has given investors passive income and growth over the long term. The company makes the elite list of Dividend Kings, players that have boosted their dividends annually for at least 50 years. Rewarding shareholders is a priority for the company, so it probably will continue along this path.', ""Right now, Coca-Cola pays investors $1.94 per share, which represents a dividend yield of 3.17%, considerably higher than the S&P 500's dividend yield of 1.47%. Since Coca-Cola generates more than $9.7 billion in free cash flow, it's clear the company has what it takes to keep lifting dividend payments annually -- offering you a growing source of income."", ""On top of this, buying Coca-Cola shares gives you access to a company with solid earnings prospects, something that generally supports share-price growth over time. That's thanks to Coca-Cola's strong brand strength, which gives it a competitive advantage or moat. The world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage company makes its eponymous drink, along with other popular brands like Dasani water and Minute Maid juices."", 'This has helped Coca-Cola to raise prices during tough economic times, such as last year, and continue to grow earnings. Last year, global unit case volume, net revenue, free cash flow, and earnings per share all advanced. And the company continues to gain value share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages market.', ""Coca-Cola shares make a top buy right now because they're trading near their lowest -- relative to forward earnings estimates -- over the past two years. At the same time, revenue is on the rise, so this looks like a great entry point."", ""Here's a company that offers you a track record of earnings increases, exposure to the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), and dividend payments. I'm talking about social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). The company recently launched its first ever dividend, paying $2 a share at a yield of 0.40%."", ""This isn't the highest dividend around, but that's OK. I like the combination of growth and passive income that you gain by investing in Meta. The company emphasized in its recent earnings report that its solid financial position will allow it to both invest in its business and return capital to investors, so I'm optimistic about these payments continuing."", ""Now let's talk about growth. Meta is going all in on AI, making it the company's top area of investment this year. The goal is to include AI across Meta products, a feature that could keep users coming back."", 'This is key because advertisers look at how much time users spend on Meta apps like Facebook or Instagram as they make advertising decisions. And Meta makes most of its revenue through advertisements on its apps. So user loyalty generally translates into demand from advertisers and, therefore, revenue growth.', 'Meta also may establish itself as an AI industry leader due to its focus on this market. For example, it developed the Llama large language models (LLMs), and this could result in additional revenue opportunities down the road.', ""Now let's take a look at valuation. For all of this, you may expect Meta to be expensive, but the stock trades for only 24x times forward earnings estimates.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study LyondellBasell Industries'  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for LyondellBasell Industries ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for LyondellBasell Industries is:', '16% = US$2.1b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""To begin with, LyondellBasell Industries seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 12% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. Despite this, LyondellBasell Industries' five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. Therefore, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""We then compared LyondellBasell Industries' net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 13% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is LYB worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether LYB is currently mispriced by the market."", ""In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 40% (or a retention ratio of 60%), LyondellBasell Industries hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds."", ""Moreover, LyondellBasell Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 54% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that LyondellBasell Industries' future ROE will rise to 23% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE."", ""In total, it does look like LyondellBasell Industries has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

According to AM Best, total net underwriting loss was $38 billion in 2023, a 10-year high, largely attributable to weather-related losses, high inflation as well as reinsurance pricing pressure.

In its last earnings report on February 6, 2024, Cincinnati Financial reported EPS of $2.28 versus consensus estimate of $1.93 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.98%."", 'For the current fiscal year, Cincinnati Financial is expected to post earnings of $6.18 per share on $9.75 billion in revenues. This represents a 2.49% change in EPS on a 9.68% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.85 per share on $10.48 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.84% and 7.56%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Cincinnati Financial may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Cincinnati Financial has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 13.6X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 17.5X versus its peer group's average of 14.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.29. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', 'We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Cincinnati Financial currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.', 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Cincinnati Financial fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Cincinnati Financial shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.', 'How Does CINF Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of CINF have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB). WRB has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of C, and a Momentum Score of C.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. W.R.

So far this year, it's also the best-performing stock in the entire index.\xa0The winners keep running higher as investors gravitate toward companies that are successfully monetizing artificial intelligence (AI)."", ""Despite the company's red-hot returns, there are reasons to believe that Nvidia could grow into its valuation over time. But some investors may want to look outside the tech sector for AI opportunities. That's where GE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ: GEHC) and Deere (NYSE: DE) come into play. Here's why Nvidia and these two underrated AI plays could be worth buying now."", ""Scott Levine (Nvidia): Over the past year, several stocks have emerged as compelling routes to gaining AI exposure. But sometimes it's OK to go with the obvious choice. For investors bullish on the prospects of AI -- and it's hard not to be -- Nvidia is still a great option. Sure, the stock has skyrocketed more than 290% since this time last year, but shares can continue flying higher."", ""Consider, for example, the valuation of Nvidia's shares. Currently, the stock is trading at 36 times forward earnings. This may seem like a frothy valuation, but it's common for stocks with high expectations surrounding them to trade at such valuations. It may seem counterintuitive to characterize a stock with a market capitalization in excess of $2.3 trillion as a growth stock, but the AI market is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate of more than 37% from 2023 to 2030, according to research firm Grand View Research."", ""While Nvidia generates revenue from the gaming and automotive industries, it's the company's data center business that's the cash cow, representing 78% of revenue in fiscal 2024. Because large language models and generative AI programs require colossal amounts of computing power, data centers use Nvidia's chips -- such as its Hopper Tensor Core GPU (graphic processing units) -- to help handle the considerable computing demands placed on them."", 'Nvidia foresees a ripe growth opportunity related to its AI offerings in the form of ""AI factories."" According to management, these are innovative data centers specifically built for AI purposes such as ""processing, refining, and transforming vast amounts of data into valuable AI models and tokens."" Nvidia estimates that leading companies will have their own AI factories to support their operations.', ""Despite the rapid rise in its price, Nvidia's stock doesn't seem to be unattractively valued. The company generates massive amounts of cash -- $26.9 billion in fiscal 2024 -- so its stock is still a great way to quench investors' thirst for AI exposure."", ""Lee Samaha (GE HealthCare): Investment in AI continues to be explosive, and the immediate beneficiaries are companies like Nvidia that create the architecture around it. That said, there's a reason why AI investment is exploding, and it comes down to the productivity improvements it generates. That's why the next wave of beneficiaries will be companies that use AI to add value to their solutions for customers."", ""Productivity improvements are never more important than in the healthcare industry, where huge volumes of important data and information are created that aren't yet being analyzed to the best of their ability. That's where GE Healthcare, a leading provider of imaging, ultrasound, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and patient care equipment, comes in."", 'The company has 58 AI-enabled device authorizations, more than any other medical technology company. Its imaging equipment can be embedded with AI to produce more intelligent systems that quickly and accurately diagnose and predict outcomes. This is a significant plus in a critical-care environment such as intensive care units, emergency departments, or neonatal intensive-care units.', ""Developing and releasing new AI-enabled products is a vital part of GE Healthcare's revenue and margin expansion plans. Indeed, management wasted no time in investing in AI after it was spun off from General Electric in early 2023 with an agreement to acquire Caption Health, a leader in AI applications in ultrasound scans, which was announced in February 2023. Moreover, management recently announced a deal to buy MIM Software, an AI solution provider of analysis for imaging and radiotherapy."", ""Investors can expect GE Healthcare to continue adding and developing complementary AI solutions and adding value in the process. That's great news for healthcare providers, patients, and investors."", 'Daniel Foelber (Deere): Deere is a good example of a technologically-forward company that often gets overlooked as a top AI player. But investors should be skeptical when it comes to massive industrial companies posing as tech companies.', 'Not to pick on Honeywell International too much, but it has been touting monetization of the industrial internet of things and automation for several years now, yet its growth has slowed to a sluggish pace.', ""Investing in innovation doesn't always translate to a material impact on the bottom line. But Deere is showing that its Smart Industrial strategy, which was introduced in 2022, is helping drive its performance. To quote Deere CEO John May from the Q1 fiscal 2024 earnings call:"", ""As I think about 2024, it's helpful to consider the smart industrial journey that we've been on, which has been grounded in unlocking incremental value for our customers through technology and enabling Deere to deliver structurally higher financial performance. I'm extremely pleased with how we've executed our production systems approach, centralized and advanced our tech stack and focused on delivering value across the entire life cycle of our solutions, all while allocating capital in a more efficient and strategic manner. Deere's last few years of financial performance are evidence of the structural improvement that comes with executing our strategy, all while delivering better outcomes for our customers."", ""This expansion cycle has been particularly sizable for Deere. When plotting a cyclical company's earnings, investors want to see a squiggle line that slopes up and to the right, accounting for downturns and expansions, with each expansion including new highs. Deere's recent expansion was abnormal. Here you can see the company's last 20 years of annual earnings."", ""There are a few downturns, followed by expansion periods and then boom -- the recent cycle from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023 showcased explosive growth. Deere attributes a lot of that growth to its combination of software and hardware that's driving efficiency for its customers."", ""In an interview with CNBC last December, Deere's Chief Technology Officer famously said that Deere is preparing for a fully autonomous farm by 2030. The company has already leveraged AI through computer vision and machine learning to help farmers lower material costs and boost crop yield by maximizing production per acre. More sophisticated machines also help boost the need for Deere services, which it can provide through its dealership network."", ""In fiscal 2023, Deere's research and development expense reached $2.2 billion -- the first time it has ever surpassed $2 billion in a single fiscal year."", ""The company's capital priorities begin with maintaining its strong balance sheet. That's followed by investing in the business and organic growth, growing the dividend while targeting a 25% to 35% payout ratio based on its midcycle earnings, and buybacks."", ""Investors looking for an industrial company that's putting innovation first to drive long-term shareholder returns over immediate returns should consider Deere for their portfolios."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.Moreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet’s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.Alphabet’s strong efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives.

Since taking the reins as CEO, the aptly dubbed ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen an aggregate return in his company\'s Class A shares of 4,927,141%, as of the closing bell on March 8, 2024. That compares to a total return, including dividends paid, of around 33,500% for the S&P 500 over the same period.', ""Riding Warren Buffett's coattails has been a moneymaking strategy for decades, which is made all the easier thanks to Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most successful investors are buying and selling, and is a required quarterly filing for money managers overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management."", 'Although most investors are intrigued to see what the Oracle of Omaha and his investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying, understanding why Buffett and his team are selling certain stocks can be just as insightful.', ""Based on Berkshire's most recent 13F, Warren Buffett and his team are selling seven stocks."", ""The first sizable holding that found itself on the chopping block during the December-ended quarter is media company Paramount Global (NASDAQ: PARA). Buffett's company pared down nearly a third of its position, which had stood at north of 93 million shares."", ""The catalyst for dumping more than 30 million shares looks to be Paramount's undesirable balance sheet. More specifically, the company is lugging around $14.6 billion in long-term debt, compared to just $2.46 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as of the end of 2023. With cord-cutting ongoing and Paramount's streaming segment still losing money, investors (including Buffett) have begun to lose patience."", ""The other side of the coin is that Paramount's streaming segment losses are lessening thanks to higher subscription prices being passed along to users. Further, legacy media companies tend to enjoy a resurgence in ad spending during major election years. Although Paramount Global clearly has concerns to address, things may not be as dire as its poor stock performance would suggest."", ""Another high-profile name that took a big haircut in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio during the fourth quarter is personal computing and printing services provider HP (NYSE: HPQ). Buffett and his aides dumped close to 78% of Berkshire's stake, compared to what was held on Sept. 30, 2023."", ""The impetus behind this selling activity may have to do with the sluggishness of personal computer (PC) sales. Though PC sales surged during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, they've meaningfully retraced with most employees returning to the office. With no sales growth forecast for the current year, HP's 3.6% dividend yield simply isn't enough of a lure to keep Buffett and his team interested."", 'HP also looks like a perfect example of a ""fair company at a wonderful price"" that Buffett would prefer to avoid. Although HP stock can be purchased for a mere 8 times forward year earnings, the company\'s growth days are long gone. Now reliant on relatively low-margin products and printing services, HP lacks the needle-moving results Berkshire\'s brightest minds desire.', 'Perhaps the most surprising selling activity during the fourth quarter was the roughly 10 million shares Buffett and his investing ""lieutenants"" parted ways with in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Keep in mind that selling 10 million shares only reduced Berkshire\'s stake in its top holding by 1.1%.', 'Chances are the Oracle of Omaha hasn\'t changed his tune on what he previously referred to as ""a better business than any we own."" Apple\'s physical product innovation has led the way for more than a decade, with the company now also emphasizing high-margin subscription services. To boot, Apple has repurchased $650.9 billion of its own common stock since the start of 2013, which is tops among public companies.', ""The most logical reason Buffett and his investing crew pared down their Apple stake is to offset realized investment losses from Paramount Global and HP. Buffett's company is sitting on an estimated $119 billion in unrealized gains on its Apple stock."", 'A popular holding that was given the heave-ho from Berkshire\'s investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter is insurance and investment company Markel Group (NYSE: MKL), which has been dubbed something of a ""mini-Berkshire"" given its penchant for making investments. Buffett and his team dumped their entire position in Markel, which had been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2022.', 'There are two educated guesses as to why Markel found itself on the chopping block. The likeliest answer is valuation. Since 2015, Markel Group had traded at or below 120% of its book value on only a handful of occasions. One of those instances was during the first quarter of 2022. With Markel\'s premium-to-book value nearing 50% just prior to the start of October 2023, the luster of getting a ""deal"" may have worn off.', ""The other possibility is Weschler or Combs, not Buffett, cut Markel loose. Buffett's investment aides are considerably more active on the trading front than he is, and this position was ultimately held less than two years."", ""Brazil-focused fintech company StoneCo (NASDAQ: STNE), which had been a five-year holding in Berkshire's portfolio, was also shown the door during the fourth quarter."", ""The motivation for Buffett and his team to part ways with StoneCo probably had to do with the company's debt-driven challenges. Brazil's central bank raised interest rates to as high as 13.75% in 2022 to get the country's inflation rate under control. Unfortunately, StoneCo's loan division was backed by debt, which sent its servicing costs soaring. Even though management has addressed these issues, StoneCo is still something of a work in progress."", ""On the other hand, StoneCo has its fingers in far more than just payments in Brazil's economy. It offers banking and credit solutions, as well as software, to micro, small, and medium-sized businesses. Although add-on service adoption is climbing, StoneCo has penetrated just a small fraction of the fintech market in Brazil."", ""The sixth stock Buffett and his team kicked to the curb during the December-ended quarter was longtime holding Globe Life (NYSE: GL). Prior to its departure, life and supplemental health insurance company Globe Life had been a continuous holding in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio for more than two decades."", ""Valuation looks to be the most sensible reason behind Buffett & Co.'s decision to sell. Shares of the company more than doubled following the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, sending its price-to-book value to nearly 300% during the fourth quarter. At no point during the 22 years that Berkshire held shares of Globe Life did it sustain a book value of more than 200% for any length of time, let alone near 300%."", ""Buffett and his team are also known for concentrating Berkshire's investments in their top ideas. Globe Life never met the definition of a core holding, which ultimately sealed its fate."", ""Last but not least, the Oracle of Omaha and his team booted homebuilder D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI) from Berkshire's investment portfolio during the December-ended quarter."", 'This is one of the biggest head-scratchers of all considering shares of D.R. Horton were only acquired during the June-ended quarter. Since Warren Buffett is a firm believer in holding wonderful businesses for extended periods, the purchase and subsequent sale of D.R. Horton suggests that Ted Weschler and/or Todd Combs were the masterminds behind this relatively quick trade.', ""History may also have played a role in dumping shares of D.R. Horton. Homebuilders aren't known for delivering outsized investment returns. Depending on Berkshire's entry and exit, it could have been up north of 50% on its stake in D.R. Horton in under nine months. That's an incredible gain for a traditionally slow-moving, highly cyclical industry. With various money-based metrics and predictive indicators alluding to a possible recession in 2024, locking in gains may have been prudent."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Paramount Global right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Paramount Global, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Paramount Global wasn’t one of them.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Boeing BA Southwest Airlines’ LUV, Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and Copa Holdings’ CPA.', 'Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:', 'Production delays at Boeing are hurting the fleet-related plans of airlines in the United States. This was echoed by airline heavyweights at the JPMorgan investor event. As a result of the crisis engulfing the plane manufacturer, airlines are being forced to cut their flight schedules. To this end, Southwest Airlines’ management stated that it was advised by Boeing to expect 46 737-8 jets in 2024 compared with the earlier stated 79 737 MAX jets, which included 58 MAX 8 planes.', 'Delta Air Lines does not expect the Boeing 737 Max 10 planes to be delivered before 2027. Previously, DAL anticipated the planes to be delivered from 2025 onward. American Airlines increased its fuel cost per gallon projection for first-quarter 2024. Copa Holdings’ February traffic report was impressive, driven by an upbeat air-travel demand.', 'Read the last Airline Roundup here.', '1. Southwest Airlines’ management expects first-quarter 2024 available seat miles to improve 11% from the year-ago reported figure (the previous anticipation was for a 10% increase). Economic fuel costs per gallon are likely to be $2.95-$3 (earlier expectation was $2.7-$2.8). LUV expects cost per available seat miles, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 6% in the first quarter from the comparable period in 2023. Interest expenses are anticipated to be $65 million in the first quarter.', 'LUV expects first-quarter 2024 revenue per available seat mile or RASM to be either flat or increase up to 2%. The earlier expectation was for a 2.5-4.5% increase. The reduced expectation is primarily due to higher-than-expected completion factors in February and March. Lower-than-expected close-in leisure passenger volume is also likely to hurt RASM. The company expects to incur a net loss in first-quarter 2024.', 'The delay in the delivery of 737 MAX jets by Boeing is prompting Southwest Airlines to re-evaluate all prior 2024 guidance, including the expectation on capex. As a result of the issues at Boeing, LUV expects the delivery schedule to be fluid and, therefore, intends to reduce capacity and re-optimize schedules, primarily for the back half of 2024, which will likely result in at least a one-point reduction in LUV’s 2024 capacity plans. While releasing its fourth-quarter 2023 results, the company’s management stated that 2024 capacity would improve 6% from the 2023 reported level.', '2. Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) increased 17.5% on a year-over-year basis at Copa Holdings in February. To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity. In February, available seat miles increased 17% year over year. With traffic growth outpacing capacity expansion, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.3% from 85.9% in February 2023. Currently, CPA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', '3. Delta, which currently does not have any Boeing 737 MAX jet in its fleet, stuck to most of its first-quarter and 2024 outlook that it had provided while releasing the fourth-quarter 2023 results. Management now anticipates first-quarter 2024 total revenues (adjusted) to be in the top half of the year-over-year increase of 3-6% mentioned previously. First-quarter 2024 earnings are expected to be 25-50 cents per share. The adjusted operating margin in the March quarter is anticipated to be 5%. Adjusted earnings for 2024 are predicted to be $6-$7 per share.', ""4. American Airlines’ management expects fuel cost per gallon of $2.8-$2.9 for first-quarter 2024 (earlier projection was at $2.65-$2.85). AAL projects the March-end quarter's loss per share (excluding net special items) to be in the lower end of the 15-35 cents mentioned previously. First-quarter available seat miles are expected to increase 6.5-8.5%. Total revenue per available seat mile is expected to increase 3.5-5.5% in first-quarter 2024 from the first-quarter 2023 actuals. The company also maintained its 2024 guidance."", 'Performance', 'Most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined 3.8% to $63.25.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global food industry in 2024, go directly and see 10 High-Quality Street Foods in the World.', 'In 2024, the global food and beverages industry is undergoing a massive transformation, marked by certain emerging trends which are likely to drive consumer demand in the coming decade, owing to increasing prevalence of alternative food sources, sustainable practices, hyperlocal sourcing, and integration of new technologies like AI and machine-learning. In 2023, consumer interest in plant-based alternatives peaked especially with regards to high-quality street foods in the world, with skyrocketing innovation and expansion in plant-based meats and seafood, dairy alternatives, and protein-rich substitutes.', 'In 2024, the sustainability trend is likely to persist with an increased focus on circular economy and local sourcing. Top players in the food and beverage industry like Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE:PEP) are diverting greater investments into the immediate reduction of food waste, advancements in eco-friendly packaging, and optimization of energy-efficient operations. Certifications like organic and fair trade, and transparent supply chains are to remain integral in curating a sustainable and ethical food landscape in the years to come. Another trend driving the food and beverage industry in 2024 is the increasing focus on personalized nutrition, clean labels, and ethical sourcing. Companies are looking to increase their footprint in areas like on-the-go food alternatives like some high-quality street foods in the world, global culinary exploration, and health-centric product portfolios, catalyzing further growth in e-commerce and D2C consumer models. Furthermore, rampant blockchain adoption for traceable supply chain lines are consolidating across the industry, ensuring that consumers have complete confidence in the safety and integrity of their food purchase decisions, especially when it comes to having some high-quality street foods in the world.', 'Lastly, companies in the food industry are renewing focus on personalized nutrition by way of integrating advanced technology, resulting in cutting-edge formulations which place greater emphasis on efficacy and safety. The integration of AI with popular nutrition applications is widely projected to revolutionize the way consumers engage with food options and create dietary schedules. The new landscape will shed light on innovative ingredients and technologies which are molding the future of the food and beverage industry in 2024. To read more on trends affecting the food industry in 2024, check out our coverage of the Healthiest Food in the World: Top 20 Countries with the Healthiest Diets.', 'Throughout the late-twentieth and the twenty-first centuries, rising rates of population growth have resulted in an increased global demand for nutrition. In the last two decades however, worsening weather conditions have also raised concerns with regards to the effects of climate change, which has markedly complicated food production even in countries with some high-quality street foods in the world. According to a report by McKinsey, major food players like Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), and PepsiCo Inc. (NYSE:PEP) have not overcome environmental challenges to any satisfactory degree. In fact, as of 2021, the global agri-food systems industry accounted for more than thirty percent of human-caused global greenhouse-gas emissions, making them an important focal point in addressing climate-related issues. The report then goes on to identify multiple avenues the food industry can opt for to meet climate targets whilst generating new revenue. One of these avenues is to minimize carbon via regenerative agricultural practices such as investing in cover crops. This could potentially make up for more than 1.2 metric gigatons of carbon dioxide out of the 6.0 to 10.0 GtCO2 of annual sequestration needed by 2050. This can also play a fundamental role in engaging with other serious sustainability concerns like biodiversity loss, nutrient pollution, and freshwater consumption.\xa0', 'According to the report however, one thing most companies and stakeholders are overlooking is the fact that efficiently producing sustainable food is meaningless unless diets shift towards more sustainable sources of energy and protein globally, especially when it comes to high-quality street foods in the world. However, the report does note that such shifts are currently underway in most countries across the world. For instance, consumers across the world are capitalizing on the alternative-protein revolution whilst it is in its early phases as companies develop and scale plant-based proteins. This can be supplemented by integrating cultivated meats, plant-based meats, and other innovative practices to aid in meeting consumer demands sustainably. However, it is true that not all consumers will be open to plant-based proteins. Thus, major players in the industry will need to divert greater investments towards alternative-protein sources like cultured (lab-grown) meat. The cultured meat segment of the industry could make up more than $25 billion in value in the next five years. However, companies must understand that consumers tend to have extremely strong preferences as to what meat should look, taste, and feel like, which creates an uphill battle for lab-grown meat providers in meeting consumer expectations.

The United States boasts one of the most complex food-delivery markets in the world. As these markets continue to expand, a report by McKinsey highlights certain critical factors which will aid in determining the levels of success for different players in the space, one of them being geographic competition among platforms. According to the report, different platforms will continue to vie for customers, restaurants, and drivers in each individual market, potentially paving the way for further consolidation over the course of time. This competition may extend to newer verticals beyond restaurants like to some high-quality street foods in the world, and platforms continue to build upon their portfolios and broaden the scope of services they provide.', 'Another primary point of contention for most players is commission rates for restaurants. Food delivery platforms like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates, and Uber Eats tend to derive revenue from five key streams: restaurant commissions (about 30 percent of the price of a meal), customer delivery fees, customer-service fees (up to 15 percent on top of delivery fees), in-app advertising, and tips, with commission fees being one of the most competitive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several local governments in the United States imposed caps on these commissions. As these caps have slowly been lifted, restaurants are feeling increasingly constrained, especially since many food delivery platforms are now much more influential and important than they were pre-pandemic. The proliferation of dark kitchens and other delivery-only models are likely to put further pressure on the restaurants.', '\xa0', 'To compile our list of the 30 high-quality street foods in the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). We then shortlisted more than 50 foods which appeared most frequently during our research. Since the quality of food is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure quality of each street food; the criteria is premised on taste (20 points), popularity amongst locals (15 points), and hygiene (10 points). We then proceeded to award each food a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 30 street foods which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the taste of each street food and popularity amongst locals.', 'To sum it up, we ranked the 30 high-quality street foods in the world\xa0using a consensus methodology.
