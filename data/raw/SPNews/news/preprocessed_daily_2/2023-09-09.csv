Demand for services has been growing over the past few months, indicating that the economy is still going strong. Also, as inflationary pressures ease further, the industry should benefit more.Moreover, with renewed optimism over the Fed likely keeping its interest rates unchanged in its upcoming FOMC, the industry is expected to get a further boost. Given this situation, stocks like Verisk Analytics, Inc. VRSK, Huron Consulting Group Inc. HURN, APi Group Corporation APG and MSCI Inc. MSCI are expected to benefit in the near term.Services Activity Grows in AugustThe Institute for Supply Management reported on Sep 6 that its non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) increased month over month to 54.5 in August, up from 52.7 in July and surpassed the consensus estimate of a decline of 53.9. Also, last month’s reading was the highest since February.The services industry has now expanded for the eighth consecutive month. The services industry accounts for over two-thirds of the economy. A reading of more than 50 indicates growth in the services sector.The Business Activity Index jumped to 57.3% in August, up 0.2% from July’s reading of 57.1%. The New Orders Index rose to 57.5%, up 2.5% from July’s reading of 55%. The index has now expanded for the eighth straight month after declining in December for the first time since May 2020.Understandably, the services industry is making a rebound as inflationary pressures continue to ease. Although the manufacturing sector continues to suffer, high demand for services has seen the industry hold its ground amid rising costs.The Fed has so far increased interest rates by 525 basis points over the past year to take its benchmark policy rate to the range of 5.25-5.5% in its fight to tame multi-decade high inflation.The Fed’s aggressive rate hike stance has seen inflation decline sharply over the last 13 months. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation rose 3.3% in July on a year-over-year basis, after hitting a high of 7% last summer.Story continuesA resilient labor market was the Fed’s biggest concern as it posed a major challenge in fighting inflation. However, the Labor Department said that job growth averaged around only 150,000 over the past three months, down from 280,000 in the previous three months through May. Also, the unemployment rate rose to 3.8% in August, up from 3.5% in July and the highest level since February.Although the Fed has hinted at more interest rate hikes, optimism has been high lately that the central bank might leave interest rates unaltered in its September FOMC meeting as fresh data hinted at a cooling labor market.Our ChoicesThe present situation makes for an ideal opportunity to invest in the following four stocks.Verisk Analytics, Inc. is one of the leading data analytics providers serving customers in insurance, energy and specialized markets, and financial services.

An executive with Schwab, which says it has only seen minimal attrition since the acquisition of its former rival closed in 2020, said the weekend represented Schwab’s Super Bowl, adding, “We could not have asked for a better outcome.”Continue reading]"

It is aiming to cut jobs at the lower end of the range, primarily in its main business divisions like investment banking and trading.Markedly, GS has undergone a minimum of three phases of layoffs since last September. These initiatives are part of the company's deep cost-savings drive amid slump in deal making activity.Reportedly, in June 2023, Goldman announced job cuts of more than 30 IB positions across the Asia region and considered firing around 125 managing directors across the globe.Further, during the first quarter of 2023, GS trimmed its headcount by 3,200, marking its biggest round of layoffs since 2008 financial crisis.

4,4a65f3ca-0f86-3ea8-afa3-372685e2c695,SCHW,2023-09-09,"Don’t be fooled, Ken Fisher says – this bull market has legs. Here are 2 stocks he’s using to bet on a bounce",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-fooled-ken-fisher-131744135.html,1694179064,STORY,"['ISRG', 'SCHW']","[Ken FisherThe best investors will often tell you that one vital ingredient for stock market success is an overlooked and underappreciated one: patience.With this year’s bull market appearing to stall, billionaire stock picker Ken Fisher reminds investors that it’s a quality needed to weather the more difficult periods, which are also a natural component of any bull market.“Volatility isn’t a flaw in this bull market. It is a feature of all bull markets, which proverbially climb a ‘Wall of Worry,’” the Fisher Investments founder recently said. “The bull market born last October should keep delivering worthy returns, but sporadically. Reaping them requires patience, which can be difficult for some.”But sticking with it is Fisher’s advice: “Don’t be fooled – this bull market has legs, and it is crucial you don’t get scared of it now.”Fisher has decades of stock market success behind him and has a net worth of $7.1 billion, so he most definitely knows what he’s talking about here. For investors looking to get ahead in the market, it’s worth finding out which stocks he’s patiently counting on to bring the goods once the upward curve resumes.We’ve started this process and have taken a look at a pair of equities that make up a meaningful chunk of Fisher’s portfolio – both holdings exceed $1 billion in value. But it’s not only Fisher showing big faith in these names; according to the TipRanks database, the analyst consensus rates both as Strong Buys. Let’s see what makes them so.Charles Schwab (SCHW)Fisher holds a big position in one of the most prominent companies in the investing world. Charles Schwab is a brokerage firm that has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of online investing and financial services. Founded in 1971 by Charles R. Schwab, it has grown to become one of the largest and most respected financial institutions in the US.The company offers a wide range of services, including stock and bond trading, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), retirement accounts, and wealth management services. Charles Schwab provides a user-friendly and technologically advanced platform for investors and was a pioneer in introducing online trading, which revolutionized the way individuals manage their investments. With a market cap over $106 billion, the company is the U.S.’s biggest publicly traded investment services firm, with ~$8 trillion in client assets.Story continuesThat said, 2023 has been no easy ride, especially earlier in the year when the stock got caught up in the fallout of several prominent bank collapses. The shares went through an almost 40% drop between January and early March. The stock has bounced back a bit since, aided by a better-than-expected Q2 print. While revenue fell by 8.4% year-over-year to $4.66 billion, the figure exceeded Street expectations by $50 million. Likewise, adj. EPS of $0.75 beat the consensus estimate by $0.04.Meanwhile, Fisher must have sensed the pullback offers an opportunity to load up. He bought 1,302,697 shares in Q2, upping his SCHW stake by 8%. His total holdings now stand at more than 18 million shares, currently worth ~$1.04 billion.Assessing the company’s prospects, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley thinks the future looks bright for this financial giant.“While eBrokers typically fall out of investor favor at the end of rate hiking cycles, the unprecedented pace of rate hikes this cycle provides a unique opportunity for NIM expansion and earnings growth even if the Fed starts cutting,” Moley explained. “In our view, SCHW remains a ’24/’25 story as (1) a return of deposit growth, (2) the paydown of temporary ST funding, (3) NIM expansion, and (4) the realization of AMTD integration synergies and incremental expense saves converge to produce strong earnings power and an attractive valuation for LT investors into this industry leading financial services franchise.”As such, Moley rates SCHW shares as Overweight (i.e., Buy), with an $86 price target, indicating potential for ~49% growth over the coming year. (To watch Moley’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Moley’s take. Based on 13 Buys, 2 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $73.80, the average target points to 12-month upside of 28%. (See SCHW stock forecast)Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Patience might be one quality investors should adhere to, but diversification is often seen as another. And in that sense, it is fitting that the next Fisher-backed stock we’ll look at is of an entirely different hue. Fisher holds 4,444,151 shares of medical device maker Intuitive Surgical. These command a market value of more than $1.32 billion.In one way, Intuitive Surgical is similar to Charles Schwab above – it is also a pioneer in its field. It is a healthcare tech company that has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgery. The Sunnyvale, California-based firm is best known for its da Vinci Surgical System, a groundbreaking robotic surgical platform. The da Vinci System enables surgeons to perform complex surgical procedures with enhanced precision, dexterity, and control through minimally invasive techniques. This innovative technology has found applications in various medical specialties, including urology, gynecology, general surgery, and cardiothoracic surgery, making it a vital tool in modern healthcare.Its usage is on the up, too. In the most recently reported quarter, for 2Q23, worldwide da Vinci procedures increased by around 22% compared to the same period last year while the company placed 331 systems, vs. the 279 placed in 2Q22. As of the end of the quarter, the installed base stood at 8,042 systems, representing a 13% year-over-year uptick.These activities led to outperformance in both the top and bottom lines. Q2 revenue climbed by 15.8% year-over-year to $1.76 billion, edging ahead of Street expectations by $20 million, while adjusted EPS of $1.42 beat the forecast by $0.09.Piper Sandler analyst Adam Maeder has been keeping a tab on ISRG’s progress and he points out a specific opportunity that might be somewhat underappreciated.“We recently took a renewed look at the China opportunity for Intuitive, which we believe is quite sizable in the coming years,” the 5-star analyst noted. “Not only will ISRG likely place a substantial amount of systems under the new quota, da Vincis in China are some of the highest utilized systems in the world—which should also bode well for procedure growth. Our math suggests that system placements from the new quota coupled with robust procedure volume from a growing install base should result in nicely accretive growth in 2023-2027. We believe ISRG’s China revenue could more-than-double from ~ $300M in 2023 (our estimate) to roughly $650M in 2027. While the Street views China to be an important growth contributor, we do not believe models are fully incorporating the magnitude of this potential growth lever.”These comments underpin Maeder’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating while his $385 price target implies shares will appreciate by ~30% over the next year. (To watch Maeder’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, most other analysts are on the same page. With 12 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that ISRG is a Strong Buy. Additionally, the $377.14 average price target brings the upside potential to ~27%.

Password resets. A lack of familiarity with slightly different functionality.In the wake a massive account transition that saw more than 7,000 advisory firms and $1.3 trillion in total assets move to Charles Schwab's platform from TD Ameritrade, that smattering of complaints is the best a trio of Schwab execs could come up with when asked what fires they were putting out on day one.Missing from the Labor Day weekend undertaking that involved the conversation of 3.6 million advisor clients and another 3.6 million retail clients were complete collapses that led to work not getting done.Instead, phone calls placed to support staff throughout the event were akin to the annoyances and hiccups associated with returning to a dormant Apple TV account whenever a new season of ""Ted Lasso"" premieres.""It's all about logins, passwords resets … mostly it's a lot of check-ins and that's about it. Really, so far, it's kind of boring,"" said Tom Bradley, a managing director for Schwab Advisor Services. ""Maybe it'll pick up a little bit in terms of excitement. But so far, the calls are fairly mundane.""A dull start to a big deal, but the tone was celebratory Tuesday afternoon as Bradley, Schwab Advisor Services Head Bernie Clark and Managing Director Jess Heffron discussed the most important day for financial advisors on a Schwab-TD Ameritrade merger journey that started three years ago.The $22 billion acquisition closed in October 2020. The shuffling of accounts from ""green"" to ""blue"" has been a rolling process with this year's Memorial Day weekend, Labor Day weekend and a weekend in early November being marked as key operational moments along the way.The transition will end with a small group of client accounts moving over during the first half of 2024. The goal is to avoid investing and trading disruptions for clients and advisors.By the latest company counts, TD Ameritrade and Schwab provide custodial services to a combined network of more than 14,000 RIAs. In total, between 18 million and 20 million accounts will be moved over the course of the entire integration, according to Schwab officials.Story continuesPost-integration, areas of focus for the merged entity include ongoing automation and efficiency improvements, modernization of books and records for the broker-dealer and workplace solutions, and rationalization of data centers and applications.For Clark, the weekend was very much a ""no news is good news"" moment. Transition complete, the focus is now on the next step. And the fact that he and his team were able to get to this step with a fairly low amount of friction tells him that work put in before the big day is paying off now.""We're really proud of what we've done here. But we're not flawless. We tend to talk about the positives, and often the world likes to hear the negatives,"" Clark said. ""I want you to hear our pride. I want you to hear our passion around what we're doing. We're not ever going to ask for forgiveness. We may just ask for time sometimes to correct things. Give us a chance to make it right.""He added that making good on those opportunities to get right have always been part of the Schwab mantra, and maintaining that mindset with the addition of TD Ameritrade is something that is critically important to continue to be a major player as the business continues to evolve.""We're going to be there and we want to be a leader in that business,"" Clark said. ""And we welcome all the competition that comes because it makes us better.""Scroll down to see some of the major takeaways as Clark, Heffron and Bradley recapped the account transition during a call with reporters and industry analysts.Are you an advisor that has been impacted by the Charles Schwab-TD Ameritrade merger? If so, has your experience been good, bad or ugly? Reach out to Financial Planning Reporter Justin Mack at justin.mack@arizent and share your story.The marathon continuesWhile the vibe was very much victory lap, the work is far from over.During the call, Technology Tools for Today (T3) Conference Producer Joel Bruckenstein called the transition a major accomplishment, but said the first day of trading and reconciliation will be the real test. ""So I think before you circle the wagons and say this has been a total success, we need to see how tonight goes,"" he said.Clark said that his team's ""big morning task""is to make sure that all Schwab's partners in the industry can get the information they need around the reconciliations, and to make sure those partners are making the data available to those that are using them. ""You know the group I'm talking about. The Envestnets and the Orion's and a host of other third parties that we've worked diligently with … they had to step up as well, to make sure that this was all going to be a success,"" Clark said in response. ""And I love the fact that you think it's a one-day worry. I think I'm gonna be worried all week.""Heffron said this was obviously a big weekend for the organization, but they're looking at it as a year of firsts. Wednesday will be the first big ""data file"" day, but their calendar is full of mini milestones that will tell the story of the transition. ""Looking ahead, you even have the first month and quarter end. Given the timing of this, year-end tax season is coming up. We're not quite (back to) business as usual,"" she said. ""That settling in period, that definitely is top of mind for us and continuing the support for our newly transitioned advisors.""A matter of sizeDespite the transition itself being described as going ""spectacularly"" by Clark, an initiative of this size with so many individuals caught up in it means that a truly uniform experience remains an impossibility. During Tuesday's call, the Schwab execs were asked to respond to criticisms from smaller firms who feel they were given less attention than larger organizations during the move. Bradley said it is important to keep in mind that 80% of Schwab's advisors have AUM of $300 million or less, and that all firms were provided the same opportunities to connect with firm leaders as changes were made.In addition to acknowledging the large number of smaller firms served by Schwab, Clark said his team has learned over time that each advisory client has a different level of complexity within their operations, which sometimes manifests itself in size. But ultimately, each firm needs something different. ""Some use us as volume transactional relationships. Some use us as thought partners and consultants. And so how we deal with our clients is often directed by their business model, not necessarily their size,"" Clark said. ""I think that gets a little lost, sometimes in the vernacular of size. In those kinds of things, we try to make it more about the needs of the advisor and how they want or need to use us.""]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.14% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.22%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.09%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 1.7% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.07% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.27% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Texas Instruments as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Texas Instruments to post earnings of $1.82 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 25.71%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.57 billion, down 12.86% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.34 per share and revenue of $18.03 billion, which would represent changes of -21.83% and -9.96%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Range Resources' shares on or after the 14th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.08 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.32 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Range Resources has a trailing yield of 1.0% on the current stock price of $32.49. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Range Resources's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Range Resources has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. View our latest analysis for Range Resources Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Range Resources is paying out just 4.6% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Range Resources generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The good news is it paid out just 6.5% of its free cash flow in the last year.It's positive to see that Range Resources's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see Range Resources's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 39% per annum for the past five years. Range Resources earnings per share have been sprinting ahead like the Road Runner at a track and field day; scarcely stopping even for a cheeky ""beep-beep"". We also like that it is reinvesting most of its profits in its business.'The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Range Resources has lifted its dividend by approximately 7.2% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineIs Range Resources an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's great that Range Resources is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. Range Resources looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.While it's tempting to invest in Range Resources for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. For example, Range Resources has 3 warning signs (and 1 which is a bit unpleasant) we think you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Also, its inorganic growth moves support expansion into new geographic footprints. However, a persistent rise in costs is expected to weigh on its bottom line. Further, lack of diversification in the loan portfolio and legal hassles are major near-term headwinds.U.S. Bancorp’s revenues witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.3% over the last three years (2019-2022). The rising trend continued in the first half of 2023. USB’s net interest income and its efforts to enhance its range of products, services and capabilities will continue to support its revenues. Management expects adjusted total revenues to reach $28-$29 billion in 2023.Apart from rising revenues, the bank’s average deposits and loans witnessed a three-year CAGR of 10.5% and 14.6%, respectively, in 2022. The rising trend for average loans and average deposits continued in the first half of 2023 compared with the previous year.U.S. Bancorp has forayed into new markets and fortified existing markets through a number of strategic acquisitions in the past years. Last year, it completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank’s core regional banking franchise from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. It completed the conversion of Union Bank during second-quarter 2023. In 2021, it completed the buyout of PFM Asset Management, TravelBank and Bento Technologies. These past acquisitions have strengthened USB’s balance sheet and fee-based businesses.USB has maintained a strong balance sheet. As of Jun 30, the company’s cash and due from banks of $70.64 billion exceeded its long-term debt of $45.28 billion, reflecting manageable debt levels. Given its decent cash levels and impressive earnings strength, its capital distribution activities seem sustainable and are likely to boost investors’ confidence in the stock.However, USB continues to record a rise in non-interest expenses. The metric has witnessed a CAGR of 5.2% over the last three years (2019-2022). The rise was mainly due to higher merger and integration charges, compensation and employee benefits, net occupancy and equipment expenses, as well as technology and communications expenditures. The rising trend continued in the first half of 2023. Management expects to incur approximately $1.4 billion in total for the Union Bank integration. Hence, USB’s cost base remains relatively high, which is likely to hinder bottom-line growth.Story continuesFurther, the lack of diversification in loan portfolio amid uncertain economic conditions are likely to act as headwinds. Around 50.4% of USB’s loan portfolio comprises commercial loans (commercial and commercial real estate lending) as of Jun 30.Analysts seem bearish regarding USB’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's 2023 earnings has been revised 2% downward over the past 60 days.

""It's the same with banking; we are trying to connect with customers and make them feel really good about the relationship they have with U.S. Bank.""Relating to customers is also an emphasis at the Consumer Bankers Association Executive Banking School, a three-year program that recently wrapped its 72nd year training veteran bankers. Salatino not only graduated from the program while also working full-time, but he won the program's top award, named after Tem Wooldridge, a former faculty member and awarded to a student who demonstrates outstanding academic performance, high integrity and a strong work ethic.Story continuesJill Enabnit, senior vice president and Head of Product Wholesale and Channel Enablement for U.S. Bank, won the award in 2013 and is now a faculty member with the program.""If we can serve our customers with empathy, that is critical because we need to be able to put ourselves in their shoes. In going through the program, that is a focus constantly through all three years,"" Salatino said.The program, which has 43 participating institutions and 350 students, is held on the campus of Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and brings together bankers from all over the country to participate in small-group learning and takes a top-down approach, with the curriculum providing different perspectives within a bank, including the head of retail banking, chief financial officer, chief risk officer and CEO.""It teaches leadership in a supercharged way,"" said Salatino, who added that working with bankers from different institutions, geographies and in different roles who he had never met before helped foster those leadership skills.The program is also an investment by the banks who send their bankers there. The bankers, meanwhile, take time away from their families to attend over the three years and do intersession projects, which Salatino said were big undertakings, spending roughly 50 to 100 hours on each project.""This is a big investment, but it's a smart one"" said Arijit Roy, head of consumer segment and solutions at U.S. Bank. ""Learning and development activities are key to our success, and having colleagues who are building leadership skills and learning, while representing the bank, is a terrific embodiment of powering human potential.""""Congratulations to Mark on his hard work and to all our bankers that graduated this year,"" Roy said, noting that U.S. Bank had 13 bankers in this year's graduating class.Salatino said he was grateful for the opportunity and brought it back to the customer.""Empathetic leaders are the best leaders in my opinion, and that's how we serve our customers, with empathy,"" he said.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/782072/trombonist-turned-banker-finds-parallels-connecting-with-audiences-and-customers]"

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 34% over a half decade. And some of the more recent buyers are probably worried, too, with the stock falling 25% in the last year. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 10% in thirty days.Since U.S. Bancorp has shed US$2.2b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Looking back five years, both U.S. Bancorp's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 1.9% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 8% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market was previously too optimistic about the stock. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 10.19.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on U.S. Bancorp's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of U.S. Bancorp, it has a TSR of -21% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 9.3% in the last year, U.S. Bancorp shareholders lost 21% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with U.S. Bancorp , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

18,1fde7749-c6f6-32fb-bc3f-28c47201cd70,EW,2023-09-09,A Look At The Fair Value Of Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-edwards-lifesciences-110018717.html,1694257218,STORY,['EW'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Edwards Lifesciences fair value estimate is US$74.88Current share price of US$74.07 suggests Edwards Lifesciences is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 22% lower than Edwards Lifesciences' analyst price target of US$95.88Does the September share price for Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.48bUS$1.70bUS$1.79bUS$1.98bUS$2.12bUS$2.23bUS$2.33bUS$2.42bUS$2.50bUS$2.58bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.01%Est @ 5.55%Est @ 4.53%Est @ 3.82%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.97% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$1.4kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$15bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.6b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$59bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$59b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$31bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$46b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$74.1, the company appears about fair value at a 1.1% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Edwards Lifesciences as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.897. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Edwards LifesciencesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

This raises the question: is the stock significantly undervalued? In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive valuation analysis of Edwards Lifesciences to answer this question. Let's delve into the financials and operations of the company to uncover its intrinsic value.A Brief Overview of Edwards LifesciencesWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with EW. Click here to check it out. EW 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of EWEdwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW), a spin-off from Baxter International in 2000, is a leading player in the medical devices and equipment industry. The company designs, manufactures, and markets a broad range of products for advanced stages of structural heart disease. Its key offerings include surgical tissue heart valves, transcatheter valve technologies, surgical clips, catheters, and monitoring systems used to measure a patient's heart function during surgery. Approximately 55% of its total sales are derived from outside the U.S.With a market cap of $45 billion and sales of $5.70 billion, Edwards Lifesciences' stock is currently trading at $74.07 per share. This is significantly lower than its Fair Value (GF Value) of $114.02, indicating that the stock might be undervalued.Edwards Lifesciences (EW): A Significantly Undervalued Gem?Understanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that reflects the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's derived from historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally trade at.Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) appears to be significantly undervalued according to the GF Value. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. Conversely, if the share price is significantly below the GF Value calculation, the stock may be undervalued and have higher future returns.Story continuesGiven that Edwards Lifesciences is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Edwards Lifesciences (EW): A Significantly Undervalued Gem?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial for investors to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding whether to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength.Edwards Lifesciences has a cash-to-debt ratio of 2.21, which ranks worse than 50.66% of 835 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Edwards Lifesciences's financial strength as 8 out of 10, suggesting a strong balance sheet.Edwards Lifesciences (EW): A Significantly Undervalued Gem?Evaluating Profitability and GrowthCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors who may want to purchase shares. Higher profit margins usually dictate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. Edwards Lifesciences has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $5.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $2.26. Its operating margin is 31.51%, which ranks better than 94.67% of 825 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. Overall, the profitability of Edwards Lifesciences is ranked 10 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. Edwards Lifesciences's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 52.14% of 725 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry. Edwards Lifesciences's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 15.5%, which ranks better than 59.95% of 729 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Edwards Lifesciences's return on invested capital is 23.95, and its cost of capital is 10.59.Edwards Lifesciences (EW): A Significantly Undervalued Gem?ConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Edwards Lifesciences appears to be significantly undervalued. The company's financial condition is strong, and its profitability is robust. Its growth ranks better than 59.95% of 729 companies in the Medical Devices &amp; Instruments industry.

(NYSE:WMT) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 2nd of January to $0.57. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 1.4%. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe aren't too impressed by dividend yields unless they can be sustained over time. Based on the last payment, Walmart was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 51.6%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.88, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.9% over that duration. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Walmart has been growing its earnings per share at 24% a year over the past five years. Walmart is clearly able to grow rapidly while still returning cash to shareholders, positioning it to become a strong dividend payer in the future.We Really Like Walmart's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 1 warning sign for Walmart that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis of the wealthiest countries, click 5 Wealthiest Countries by Per Capita Net Worth.World’s Richest Countries' Wealth ShareGlobal wealth comprises all the assets including monetary assets and other assets in all areas of the world. The wealthiest countries in the world are the powerbrokers in the global economy. The richest countries in the world hold a majority portion of the global wealth. Countries including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, India, and Canada hold the highest share of the global wealth. According to the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report of 2023, the global wealth share for the United States was 30.8% and China’s global wealth share accounted for 18.6%. Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom followed next with a global wealth share of 5%, 3.8%, and 3.5%, respectively. These rich countries have great investment opportunities. Some of the countries that are best for FDI and FPI include the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Canada - to name a few. These countries offer attractive investment opportunities due to the high-spending consumer market, business-friendly regulations, and profitable real estate market. Impact of COVID-19 on Global WealthThe COVID-19 pandemic had severe implications for the global economy. The wealthiest countries in the world had a hard time tackling the pandemic despite the resources. The wealthiest countries were exposed to their older population and higher health expenses. Furthermore, the economic fallout of lockdowns devastated low-income citizens and workers. Whereas the rich population had more resources and capital to deal with the circumstances. The pandemic had a major impact on the global inequality index. The wealthiest people have always enjoyed the perks of dominating global wealth. Oxfam International, which studies global inequality, shared the statistics of the richest global wealth share. According to Oxfam International, the richest 1% took almost two-thirds of all new wealth created since 2020, which accounted for $42 trillion. That’s nearly twice as much money as the remaining 99% of the world’s population grabbed since 2020. Story continuesWith the richest population taking away the majority of the global wealth, the increase in wealth inequality during the pandemic was reversed in 2022. According to Credit Suisse’s report, the global wealth share of the top 1% plunged to 44.5% during 2022. Some of the key factors to the decline in wealth in 2022 included inflation and appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. British economist and Credit Suisse’s report author, Anthony Shorrocks said:“If exchange rates were held constant at 2021 rates, then total wealth would have increased by 3.4% and wealth per adult by 2.2% during 2022. This is still the slowest increase of wealth at constant exchange rates since 2008. Keeping exchange rates constant but counting the effects of inflation results in a real wealth loss of –2.6% in 2022.”World’s Richest WealthThe world’s wealthiest people massively contribute to the global economy. Over the last decade, the richest 1% gathered around half of all new wealth, as per Oxfam International. On January 16, Oxfam International published a report on the survival of the richest, highlighting the global wealth inequality and wealth of the richest.

These companies paid out almost $257 billion of the total profits to rich shareholders. The retail giant Walmart Inc.’s (NYSE:WMT) owners, the Walton family, received $8.5 billion in 2022. Companies Driving WealthWalmart Inc.

We're gaining share across markets and formats, growing units sold, transaction counts are positive across markets, and growth in operating income is outpacing sales. We're really pleased with our first half performance. For the quarter, comp sales for Walmart U.S. were ahead of where we thought they'd be at 6.4%. Sam's Club U.S. was 5.5% and sales for international were up 11%, led by double-digit growth at Walmex and China. Flipkart's GMV was also strong. The team is driving results in the short-term and building for the future.”Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another mega-company that has created wealth for its owners.

However, Kroger has now surpassed earnings expectations for 15 consecutive quarters.Naturally, monopoly fears have existed as a formation with Albertsons would create a mega-chain in the supermarket industry. Like Kroger, Albertsons stock has rebounded lately and is up +6% this month but still -30% below its acquisition price of $34.10 per share in a deal that would be valued at $24.6 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFTC’s Monopoly ConcernsEven after this morning's announcement that Kroger would divest hundreds of stores, the combined stores that the company would operate upon acquiring Albertsons could still be close to Walmart WMT, which has over 4,000 domestic stores.This market dominance would be exciting for investors but worries the FTC as Walmart is an omnichannel retailer that was built up internally over time and not a pure-play grocery chain that monopolizes the market.Growth Potential Gravitating to the growth conversation of a potential Kroger and Albertsons merger is at the forefront of investors' minds and the FTC’s agenda.Taking a look at total sales is a way to see the viewpoint of what would be high investor sentiment and the FTC’s concerns. Kroger’s sales are forecasted to be up 2% in its current fiscal 2024 to $151.61 billion with Albertsons' sales expected to rise just over 1% at $78.86 billion.Theoretically, their combined annual revenue would be $230.47 billion which is still far below Walmart’s anticipated $642.11 billion in sales. However, about half of Walmart’s sales are attributed to groceries including online purchases which would bring a Kroger and Albertsons combo closer to that mark with it being plausible that their growth will be vastly compounded going forward.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEPS Outlook &amp; P/E ValuationsRegarding their bottom lines, Kroger’s earnings are projected to rise 7% in FY24 but dip roughly -1% in FY25 at $4.48 per share. Kroger’s stock currently trades at 10X forward earnings which is a nice discount to the Zacks Retail-Supermarkets Industry average of 13.3X and the S&amp;P 500’s 20.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTurning to Albertsons, its FY24 earrings are expected to dip -16% after a very tough-to-follow FY23 that saw EPS at $3.37. Fiscal 2025 earnings are expected to stabilize and rebound 3% at $2.88 per share. Plus, Albertson’s stock trades at just 8.2X forward earnings which is a 61% discount to its Zacks Consumer Products-Staples Industry average of 20.9X and well below the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAt the moment, Kroger and Albertsons’ stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Stockers and personal shoppers for online orders who join the Walmart workforce now make the same starting wage as cashiers — about $1 less per hour than the starting wage for those roles three months ago. Pay for existing workers did not change.The world's largest retailer said it updated its pay structure to be ""more consistent"" across jobs and to create ""new opportunities for associates to gain new skills from experience across the store,"" Anne Hatfield, a Walmart spokesperson, told Yahoo Finance. Hatfield added that nearly 50,000 employees received a wage increase following the change.""This news does indicate the labor market tightness is easing more broadly,"" Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in a note, adding: ""We don't believe that this change will have a material impact on Walmart's payrolls.""A Walmart worker organizes products at a Walmart store in Teterboro, New Jersey, U.S., October 26, 2016. (Eduardo Munoz/REUTERS) (Eduardo Munoz / reuters)To some on Wall Street, the move suggests Walmart now has a leg up on workers, setting a different tone than earlier this year when it hiked its average hourly wage to $17.50 as companies struggled to attract enough staff.The tight labor market also led other major retailers such as Home Depot (HD) to announce billion-dollar investments in wages earlier this year. But that may no longer be the norm going forward, as Walmart is seen as a bellwether for the economy.As America's biggest private employer, providing nearly 1.6 million jobs in the US, Walmart often sets precedents for other retailers.""The application rates must be up,"" Sucharita Kodali, Forrester Research retail analyst, told Yahoo Finance.

""It shortens the revenue cycle, which accelerates cash flow.""A more positive cash flow could lead to a far more robust level of financing options, Storer added. ""We'll have a new state of things when we launch this,"" Storer said. ""Because of the new fidelity, we're going to be able to create new structured products, which we haven't been able to use in health care. We're going to be able to make the traditional products like lines of credit and term-loan financing way better.""Huntington disclosed its equity investment in Veuu Thursday in a press release. It didn't say how much of the company it acquired.Coding errors, Storer said, have long been a pain point for hospitals, health systems, doctor practices and outpatient surgery centers, the target market for Veuu's software, so much so that many patients routinely delay paying bills while insurance reimbursement is up in the air. Indeed, according to one study cited by Becker's Hospital Review, as many as 80% of medical bills contain at least one coding error.""You never pay your first statement,"" Storer said. ""You know there are going to be adjustments. It just stretches out the payment cycle.""The issue has affected the way Huntington and other banks approach health care lending. ""We might give a line of credit to a really strong hospital, but we're really not taking their receivables. … There's just so much variability with the value of that asset,"" Storer said. To borrow against outstanding bills, health care providers have turned to nonbank lenders who typically charge higher rates, Storer added. While it's still in the trial phase, Veuu's software has produced significant improvements in coding accuracy, Terence Mills, the fintech's CEO, said Friday. In one pool of claims initially processed by a participating hospital's in-house billing team, Veuu improved the accuracy rate from 61% to 92%, saving thousands of work hours, in the process.Story continuesThe solution works by studying medical claims that were successfully paid. ""We've found there's one way to measure accuracy in coding health care claims and that is specifically based on adjudication — did [the claim] get paid or not,"" Mills said. ""It has nothing to do with fuzzy math. It's more about can we improve the number of claims that are otherwise coded improperly to code them correctly, and can we get them paid.""According to Mills, the problems with medical billing stem from language. Coding is derived from practitioners' diagnoses, ""and all doctors [write] differently,"" Mills said. ""One doctor can diagnose in three words. The next doctor comes along and the diagnosis could be buried in a paragraph of 25 words."" Coders must then select the proper classifications from approximately 67,000 diagnosis codes to generate a bill.""That's a problem for humans,"" Mills said. ""It's also a problem for machines. The machine needs to be built in a particular way to be able to flesh out the important nature of what the doctor said.""A team of nearly 50 software engineers worked full time for nearly five years to develop Veuu's solution, Mills said. It's by no means the only one in the works. In February, CodaMetrix, a Boston-based fintech, received $55 million from venture capital investments to boost development of a rival AI-powered billing solution.Huntington decided to invest in Veuu after viewing a presentation by Mills and his team at the bank's Columbus, Ohio, headquarters earlier this year. Storer, who has worked in health care banking since the early 1990s, remains confident it will prove game-changing.""It changes the current state,"" Storer said. ""This is going to be the new commercial paper market,"" Storer said. ""We're going to be trading these receivables in the future. Banks trade receivables every day, that's very common, but nobody trades pools of medical receivables.""Huntington and Veuu expect to launch their medical billing solution in the first half of 2024. ]"

(NYSE:IT) is one of the worlds most renowned research and advisory companies. It is most famous for its Magic Quadrant, in which Gartner assesses companies in order to identify leaders across a variety of industries, from supply chain management software to artificial intelligence.The company reported strong financial results for the second quarter in August, beating both revenue and earnings forecasts.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with WMB. Click here to check it out. IT 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ITGartner: Research Powerhouse Continues to RoarWhat makes Gartner special?Gartner has a strong brand and sits at a key point in the market. The business gives buyers an independent review point which can help them pick software and choose business partners.The company is a thought leader across a variety of topics and provides independent research reports to business customers.Gartner is known for its range of conferences, which sponsor various industry sectors. This acts as a great top of the funnel process to entice new customers and offer more value to existing customers.The business also operates a strong consulting service covering a variety of areas, from digital transformation to technology strategy evaluation, IT cost optimization and Big Data.Solid financialsGartner reported solid financial results for the second quarter. Its revenue was $1.5 billion, which beat analyst forecasts by $1.5 billion and rose by 9.2% year over year.The top line also beat analyst forecasts by $23.65 million, driven by strong Research revenue, which increased by 6% year over year or 7% on a constant currency basis. This segment is also its largest and most profitable with a 73% contribution margin, higher than the companys average of 68%.This was further benefited by a range of growing topics, such as artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics and even remote work.Gartner: Research Powerhouse Continues to RoarGartner's overall contract value rose by 9% year over year to $4.6 billion. This was driven by double-digit growth of enterprise leaders such as chief financial officer and chief information security officer customers. Tech vendor contract value was a little slower with single-digit growth, which was lower than the mid-teens growth reported in the prior year.Story continuesOverall contract value growth was diverse across industries. This was led by strong growth in the transportation sector, followed by retail and the public sector.Breaking down by segment, global technology sales reached $3.5 billion, up 7% year over year.GTS wallet retention was a solid 102%, which was down slightly from the 107% in the prior year. However, this is still solid as it means customers are sticking with Gartner specifically.Moving on to global business sales, its contract value was $1 billion, which rose by 15% year over year. This was led by the supply chain industry. Upon the reopening of the economy in 2021, many companies suffered with supply chain disruption and thus, this has made it a critical issue for businesses to address.Human resources was also a strong area of growth. This was driven by the rise of remote working, which has created an entirely new setup that is required for organizations.Overall GBS retention was a solid 109%. Again, this was down from the 115% in the prior year, but still positive overall.Consulting revenue continues with strong growth as it rose by 5% year over year to $126 million, at a 37% contribution margin.There was a solid backlog reported for this segment, with $172 million in revenue up 17% year over year.Conferences have had a resurgence now that in-person events are back in vogue. In the second quarter, Gartner reported $169 million in revenue, which beat internal expectations. This was driven by a roadshow of 17 conferences during the quarter. The contribution margin for this product type was also stable at 58%,Finally, contract optimization, a small business segment, reported $22 million in revenue.Profitability and balance sheetMoving on to profitability, Gartner reported operating income of $299 million, which declined by 3.87% year over year. This was driven by a 12.95% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses to $670 million.GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 15% year over year, qhile the overall company headcount rose to 20,104 associates, up 12%. In consultancies, the people are the product and thus, it can be more challenging to cut costs in this area.Gartner: Research Powerhouse Continues to RoarValuationGartner trades with a price-sales ratio of 4.85, which is higher than its five-year average, but lower than its ratio over 6 in 2021.Gartner: Research Powerhouse Continues to RoarBased on historical ratios, past financial performance and analysts' future earnings projections, the GF Value Line also indicates a fair value of $345 per share. Thus, the stock is fairly valued at the time of writing. Final thoughts Gartner is a leading consultancy company that has a unique place in the market. Vendors rely on the company to assess the quality of their product relative to competitors. This effectively gives it a stranglehold on this market and a competitive advantage. Its competitors do offer similar services, but Gartner has the highest focus on enterprises (the most lucrative customer base).This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Tethys Petroleum's (CVE:TPL) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Tethys Petroleum, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.38 = US$34m ÷ (US$96m - US$7.3m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Tethys Petroleum has an ROCE of 38%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Oil and Gas industry average of 13%. See our latest analysis for Tethys Petroleum roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you'd like to look at how Tethys Petroleum has performed in the past in other metrics, you can view this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWe're delighted to see that Tethys Petroleum is reaping rewards from its investments and is now generating some pre-tax profits. The company was generating losses five years ago, but now it's earning 38% which is a sight for sore eyes. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 58% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.Story continuesOne more thing to note, Tethys Petroleum has decreased current liabilities to 7.6% of total assets over this period, which effectively reduces the amount of funding from suppliers or short-term creditors. This tells us that Tethys Petroleum has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.In Conclusion...To the delight of most shareholders, Tethys Petroleum has now broken into profitability. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 41% return over the last three years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.One more thing to note, we've identified   4 warning signs  with Tethys Petroleum and understanding these should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Back in June, we reported that commodity shipping stocks had gone on a tear after freight rates for U.S.-loading supertankers had skyrocketed as Asian refiners turned to the U.S. market amid production cuts by OPEC+ nations.Average spot rates for older very large crude carriers (VLCCs) climbed to $83,300 per day while rates for newer and more fuel-efficient VLCCs hit $91,000 per day. VLCCs are super-massive tankers that carry 2 million barrels of oil.Well, things have taken a 180-degree turn, and shipping stocks are currently getting hammered after Saudi Arabia extended its voluntary 1-million-barrel-per-day (b/d) production cut through year-end, while Russia extended its own 500,000-b/d voluntary production cut in August with a 300,000-b/d reduction from September through December.The Saudi cuts are seen as particularly damaging to demand for VLCCs, as well as ships that carry Russian exports mainly Suezmaxes (1 million-barrel capacity) and Aframaxes (750,000-barrel capacity). According to Kpler data, Russia’s seaborne crude exports clocked in at 3.12 million b/d in August, down 18% from the recent high in May while seaborne products exports averaged 1.58 million b/d last month, 22% lower than the March high. Falling ton-miles (volume multiplied by distance) as well as lower tanker rates has been depressing overall shipping revenues, with most companies in the space expected to post a weak fourth quarter.Consequently, leading commodity shipping stocks have been reversing earlier gains: over the past 30 days, Tsakos Energy Navigation (NYSE: TNP) shares have declined 9.7%; Teekay Tankers (NYSE: TNK)-12.2%; Nordic American Tankers (NYSE: NAT)-11.9%, Frontline (NYSE: FRO)-4.0%, Euronav NV (NYSE: EURN)-11.3% and International Seaways (NYSE: INSW)-6.7%.Long-Term BullishBut the tanker bulls have refused to give up, and insist there’s plenty of light at the end of what they consider a short tunnel.Story continues“While Q4 crude-tanker earnings will likely be softer than expected, the outlook for 2024 has become much more exciting,” wrote Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta in a client note on Wednesday. Nokta says he’s “increasingly confident that 2024 will be a banner year for tankers,” with the market poised for a “rate eruption”.According to Clarksons Securities analyst Frode Mørkedal, “When OPEC+ eventually resumes production, which is projected to happen in earnest by Q2 2024, the tanker market should experience an immediate uplift.”Interestingly, it’s not just Wall Street punters that are buying the bullish narrative but ship owners themselves, with some reportedly pulling their older tankers from second-hand markets in anticipation of another boom time. The experts are also predicting stronger growth in the coming year:‘‘We forecast that the crude tanker market will see cargo volume growth of between 2.0% and 3.0% in 2023 and between 3.5% and 4.5% in 2024. As average sailing distances are increasing, we estimate tonne miles growth of between 5.0% and 6.0% in 2023, and between 5.5% and 6.5% in 2024,’’ BIMCO’s chief shipping analyst, Niels Rasmussen, has written saying that record oil demand amplifies market strength.To be fair, it’s not hard to see why optimism remains high with oil demand still robust.China worries aside, physical markets continue to show signs of strength, with Asian refineries expected to continue ramping up imports while crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub are expected to drop to their lowest level since April.Supplies have become increasingly tight since late June as Saudi Arabia and Russia cut production. Indeed, the latest energy report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that global oil demand grew by 3.26 million barrels per day  in Q2, reaching an all-time high of 103 mb/d. The IEA estimates that the call on OPEC and inventories will be 30 mb/d in Q3 and 29.8 mb/d, which implies inventory draws of over 2mb/d in both quarters at current OPEC output levels; the IEA assessed OPEC output at 27.86 mb/d in July. The call on OPEC is a measure of the “excess demand” that OPEC countries face, and equals the global oil demand minus both the crude oil production by non-OPEC countries and the production by OPEC countries which are not subject to quota agreements.Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have buttressed that view saying their projections also imply large inventory draws peaking at 2.9 mb/d in August. However, their timing for when demand will hit a new high is a couple of months later than the IEA’s. StanChart estimates that June demand was about 0.5 mb/d below August 2019’s all-time high, but expects the record will be exceeded in the current month. According to the analysts, highly effective producer output restraint, led by Saudi Arabia, will create the conditions for a price rally that will take Brent prices above this year high at $89.09/bbl onto their Q4-average forecast at $93/bbl, with a likely intra-quarter high above $100/bbl.Last month, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast total U.S. output will hit 12.61M bbl/day in the current year, eclipsing the previous record of 12.32M bbl/day set in 2019's and easily beating last year's 11.89M bbl/day.  U.S. crude oil output is up 9% Y/Y, which under normal circumstances would blunt OPEC’s efforts to keep supplies low in a bid to goose prices. There is little doubt the U.S. Shale Patch is largely responsible for keeping oil markets well supplied and oil prices low: Rystad Energy  has estimated that whereas OPEC and its allies have announced cuts amounting to ~6% of 2022's production, non-OPEC supply has made up for two-thirds of those cuts, with the U.S. accounting for half of that. Thankfully, U.S.output is unlikely to go high enough to put significant pressure on international prices.StanChart says the sharp tightening shown in most H2 balances is starting to spill-over into physical markets, and oil prices appear to be well supported to overcome the negative news coming from China.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:China’s Massive Gold-Buying Spree ContinuesEngineers Unveil Game-Changing Thin-Film Solid-Sate BatteryChina Races Ahead In Global Nuclear Power DevelopmentRead this article on OilPrice.com]"
40,63938dc9-1725-3b3e-81af-fcd2a5c5d14f,O,2023-09-09,Guyana's Oil Boom Challenges OPEC+ Dominance,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guyanas-oil-boom-challenges-opec-220000261.html,1694210400,STORY,"['CL=F', 'XOM']","[In a mere four years, Guyana went from first discovery to first oil, a rapid timeframe in an industry where it can take years to bring major energy projects online. The former British colony is now a major South American oil producer and global petroleum exporter. As a result, Guyana is benefiting from a tremendous economic windfall, with the country emerging as the world’s fastest-growing economy with 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) expanding by a stunning 62%. Industry consultancies and the government in Georgetown expect Guyana to be pumping 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day by 2027, a figure greater than many OPEC members. Exxon’s commitment to developing the offshore 6.6-million-acre Stabroek Block indicates oil output could soar even higher. This has the potential to alter global energy market dynamics and challenge the price-making power of the OPEC Plus consortium.Data from Guyana’s Ministry of Natural Resources shows the country of less than one million was lifting 351,600 barrels of oil per day at the end of July 2023. That production volume pumped by the Liza Destiny and Unity floating production storage and offloading vessels (FPSOs) is greater than their combined nameplate capacity of 340,000 barrels per day. Exxon, which holds a 45% stake in the Stabroek Block and is the operator, prioritized development of the block in late-2020 due to the Liza oilfield’s low breakeven price of $25 per barrel to $35 per barrel and high-quality light sweet crude oil. That saw the global energy supermajor ramp up activity with a large exploration drilling campaign that eventually yielded over 30 discoveries and more than 11 billion barrels of oil resources in the Stabroek Block.Since the first oil discovery in the Stabroek Block was made in 2015, the Exxon-led consortium comprised of Hess, with a 30% interest, and CNOOC, holding a 25% stake, have approved six projects with the initial Liza phase-1 and 2 developments complete. There are four more operations being developed, which, on start-up, will significantly lift oil production to at least 1.2 million barrels per day, and perhaps more. These include the 220,000 barrel per day Payara operation, with the first oil slated for late 2023 and the 250,000 barrels per day Yellowtail project, which will commence operations in 2025. Earlier this year, the consortium approved the $12.7 billion 250,000 barrel-per-day Uaru project, which is expected to start production during 2026. In the latest news, Exxon and its partners in the prolific Stabroek Block announced they will proceed with the sixth development, the nearly $13 billion Whiptail project. This facility will consist of 72 wells with a nameplate production capacity of 250,000 barrels per day and commence operations in late 2027.Story continuesOnce all of those assets are operational, Exxon will have the capacity to lift just over 1.3 million barrels per day from the Stabroek Block. Each of those operations, like the functioning Liza Phase-1 and Phase-2 FPSOs, possesses the potential to pump more petroleum than the designated capacity. For this reason, oil output from the Stabroek Block could easily surpass the 1.3 million barrels expected. By 2027, Guyana’s petroleum output could very well surpass the forecast of 1.2 million barrels daily, which will see the country exceed the petroleum output of many OPEC members and become the world's 16th largest oil producer.The immense international interest in Guyana is being driven by a high exploration success rate and substantial offshore petroleum potential, which appears to exceed that estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. The light sweet oil being discovered, with the Liza grade possessing an API gravity of 32 degrees and 0.58% sulfur content, is easier and cheaper for refineries to process into high-quality fuels further adding to offshore Guyana’s popularity. According to Rystad Energy, the carbon intensity of the oil being extracted is among some of the lowest globally. That is an extremely attractive attribute for foreign energy companies at a time when big oil is being pressured to sharply reduce emissions and become carbon neutral. Industry low breakeven prices, estimated by Rystad to average $28 per barrel, make operating in offshore Guyana highly profitable, especially with Brent selling for around $90 a barrel.For those reasons, Guyana’s rising petroleum output will not stop at 1.2 million or 1.3 million barrels per day, nor will discovered oil resources remain at around 11 billion barrels, both will expand at a solid clip. Earlier this year, Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency greenlighted Exxon’s 35-well drilling campaign for the Stabroek Block, which will lead to further oil discoveries based on the supermajor’s success rate. Other foreign energy companies are investing in exploration assets and drilling activities in offshore Guyana. Georgetown’s pending first-time oil auction, which has been delayed multiple times since December 2022, captured considerable interest. Reportedly, Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras is eyeing investing in Guyana while French supermajor TotalEnergies, which made five commercial discoveries in nearby Block 58 offshore Suriname, has interests in Guyana’s Canje and Kanuku Blocks.Guyana’s growing production and discovered oil resources will boost global supply at a crucial time, which will diminish the influence of the OPEC Plus cartel. In recognition of this and Guyana’s tremendous petroleum potential, OPEC is attempting to woo the former British colony to join its ranks. The cartel has invited representatives from Guyana to participate in its meetings in Europe but has yet to officially invite the country to join the cartel. Regardless, Georgetown appears reticent to join OPEC, especially with membership requiring Guyana to comply with various rules and regulations. Indeed, such a move would place limitations on Guyana’s oil industry by requiring compliance with OPEC Plus production quotas, a key reason regional neighbor Ecuador exited the cartel in 2020.Guyana’s explosive arrival as a serious global oil producer, going from first discovery to first oil in a mere four years, will challenge OPEC’s dominance. When coupled with Brazil’s plans to become the world’s fourth largest producer, South America will reemerge as a major petroleum-producing region with the capability to challenge OPEC Plus’s role as a global price maker. These are all significant developments for the world’s largest oil consumer, the U.S., where Gulf Coast refineries, since 2019 when President Donald Trump ratcheted up sanctions against Venezuelan oil have been seeking alternate sources of supply. It will also blunt the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s at times antagonistic attitude toward the U.S., which is responsible for higher oil prices.By Matthew Smith for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:U.S. Consumer Oil Demand Has Exceeded ExpectationsSaudi Arabia Reaps The Benefits Of Steepening BackwardationThe Tipping Point In Global Oil DemandRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

It is among the banks leading the underwriting for IPOs from SoftBank Group’s Arm Holdings and grocery delivery service Instacart, which would both be among the year's biggest.""Obviously an environment with more capital markets activity is a good environment for Goldman Sachs,"" he said.Solomon is under pressure to improve Goldman's results after reporting the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with everything from job cuts and a two-year-long investment banking slump to reports of partner unrest and questions about his leadership style.He declined during the interview to address some recent media stories about his leadership, saying ""I've talked plenty about the noise and the press."" His focus each day, he said, is on the company and its clients and delivering for shareholders — ""that's the discussion inside Goldman Sachs.""Clients, he added, ""have enormous confidence in Goldman Sachs. The feedback from our clients around Goldman Sachs and the work we do for them continues to be very, very strong.""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon pictured in April of this year in Washington. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)Goldman’s stock is down 5.5% so far this year. It has outperformed Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) while underperforming Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The KBW Nasdaq US bank index (^BKX) is down 21% for the same period.Since Solomon became CEO in October 2018, Goldman's stock is up 45%. That is better than many Wall Street banks, except rivals Morgan Stanley and Jefferies (JEF). The KBW index has fallen 23% over the same time.Story continuesThe new fall lineup of IPOs, which also includes marketing automation software firm Klaviyo and German shoe maker Birkenstock, comes just in time for banks like Goldman that hope to end an extended dealmaking slump that followed a boom in 2021.Clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy, dampening the optimism needed to go public, buy other companies, or take on more debt.As dealmaking dried up, Goldman and other firms across Wall Street slashed bonuses and staff, announcing cuts of roughly 20,000 jobs since the end of 2022.""We've been through a really tough year for capital markets activity,"" Solomon said Friday.""We went from a very robust environment in 2021 to obviously a much different environment after the war in Ukraine started and obviously ... very, very high rampant inflation"" that the Federal Reserve tried to tamp down with the most aggressive series of interest rate hikes in decades.But the US economy, he said, ""has been a lot more resilient over the last 12 months than we would have expected. I think the chance for a softer landing right now is much higher than we would have anticipated a year ago.""Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius, who has been one of the most outspoken voices on Wall Street about a reduced risk of a recession, lowered expectations for a recession further earlier this week.While Goldman waits out the tepid period of dealmaking, Solomon is also attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer banking and backing away from offering financial advice to mass market customers so that the firm can focus on its core ultrarich clients.He said Friday that Goldman has no plans to buy a bank and is focused on its principal businesses: investment banking and markets and wealth management.""That's where the lion's share of the firm's focus is at this point in time.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
44,ee0b91e2-b282-315a-ada3-35fca120074e,MS,2023-09-09,Is Trending Stock Morgan Stanley (MS) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-morgan-stanley-ms-130006077.html,1694178006,STORY,['MS'],"[Morgan Stanley (MS) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this investment bank have returned -4.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, which Morgan Stanley falls in, has lost 6.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Morgan Stanley is expected to post earnings of $1.42 per share, indicating a change of -7.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -8.3%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.14 indicates a change of +22.4% from what Morgan Stanley is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Morgan Stanley is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Morgan Stanley, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $54.78 billion and $58.52 billion estimates indicate +2.1% and +6.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMorgan Stanley reported revenues of $13.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.5%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.76 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.46%. The EPS surprise was +8.77%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Morgan Stanley is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Morgan Stanley. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that FE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.04, while NEE has a forward P/E of 21.30. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.54.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 1.85. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 2.50.These metrics, and several others, help FE earn a Value grade of B, while NEE has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesFE sticks out from NEE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FE is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(ATSI) started upgrading 20 miles of a high-voltage power line in the Ohio counties of Belmont and Harrison in order to reinforce the local transmission system. The reconstructed 138-kilovolt line, which is the third stage of a bigger 64-mile transmission project, will increase service reliability, boost system resilience and handle potential increases in consumer demand for power.The 20-mile stretch connects a substation in Belmont County, OH, to a substation in Columbiana County, OH, and is the southernmost part of the larger 64-mile project. In January 2023, the company completed the upgrade of the first 13-mile segment, located in the West Township area of Columbiana County and the August Township and Washington Township areas of Carroll County. In May 2023, work was completed on a further 9-mile section that runs through Harrison County's Rumley Township and Carroll County's Perry Township.Benefits of the MoveThe 20-mile line runs through the cities of St. Clairsville, Athens Township in Harrison County, Richland Township in Belmont County, Mead Township in Belmont County, and Pultney Township in Belmont County. The work will involve constructing bigger cables that can handle more electrical load and meet increased consumer demand in addition to replacing old wooden pole structures with new steel monopoles. The project is anticipated to be completed in late 2024.The brand new, cutting-edge infrastructure is anticipated to boost system performance and lessen the frequency of service outages for users. In the future, the project will also help FirstEnergy in meeting the rising need for secure, reliable electricity in homes and businesses of eastern Ohio.The project is a part of the multi-year effort Energizing the Future, which aims to modernize FE's transmission system with cutting-edge machinery and technology that will help further strengthen the power grid. Through 2022, FirstEnergy has invested more than $10 billion to the Energizing the Future program.Story continuesNeed for UpgradesA rise in temperature not only increases the demand for electricity but also poses a threat to electric infrastructure. These upgrades and maintenance tasks are crucial to maintaining service reliability and ensuring customer satisfaction.FirstEnergy has been strengthening its transmission and distribution operations. During the second-quarter, the company upgraded its 69-kilovolt transmission line which traverses Springfield Township and Moorefield Township for a distance of slightly more than 11 miles to the northeast, with sections of the line running alongside Interstate 68. ATSI replaced 105 wood poles over a six-mile stretch of the line and installed five new steel poles on foundations to help reduce unanticipated outages brought on by extreme weather.Utilities’ Focus on InfrastructureIn order to provide reliable services to customers, utilities make systematic investment to upgrade transmission and distribution lines and develop new substations. The objective is to warrant proper supply of electricity to millions of customers across the United States.Along with FirstEnergy, other electric power companies like Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL, Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy DUK are adopting measures to strengthen their existing infrastructure.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027, out of which the company plans to invest nearly $18 billion in strengthening its electric distribution and transmission operations.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.07%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.4%.Exelon invests substantially in infrastructure projects. It plans to spend nearly $31.3 billion during 2023-2026 on regulated utility operations for grid modernization and enhancement of its infrastructure’s resilience.EXC’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year improvement of 3.5%.Duke Energy remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. Almost 85% of the company’s planned investment funds its generation fleet transition and grid modernization. This includes approximately $75 billion to modernize and strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 6.5%.Price PerformanceIn the past month, shares of FirstEnergy have lost 2% compared with the industry’s 5.1% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankFirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

50,973b9219-2d3c-3605-a0bf-299f678259f1,CRM,2023-09-09,"Salesforce Insiders Sell US$106m Of Stock, Possibly Signalling Caution",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-insiders-sell-us-106m-110013839.html,1694257213,STORY,['CRM'],"[Many Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SalesforceIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, sold US$105m worth of shares at a price of US$211 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$225). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 1.8% of Marc Benioff's holding.In the last year Salesforce insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Salesforce Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Salesforce shares. Specifically, Co-Founder Marc Benioff ditched US$105m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Salesforce Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Salesforce insiders own about US$6.6b worth of shares (which is 3.0% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Do The Salesforce Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Salesforce shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Salesforce is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Salesforce has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:CRM) is no exception. With a keen eye on the future, the company has embarked on a strategic journey to integrate AI into all its business segments. Its AI product, Einstein, is integrated into several products, automating processes, creating personalized marketing emails, performing data analytics and improving customer support with Einstein Bots. This comprehensive integration boosts productivity and liberates employees to focus on tasks that AI cannot accomplish.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMDuring a recent earnings call, Salesforce founder and Co-CEO Marc Benioff highlighted the importance of the AI revolution for the company. The second-quarter results show the company's dedication to AI with an 11% increase in revenue year over year and a 17% GAAP operating profit, contradicting past criticisms of Salesforce's lack of GAAP profitability despite its size.Salesforce's long-term prospects look promising. The company's investments in AI and automation are timely and address the growing demand for these technologies. As organizations worldwide look to streamline their operations and make better use of their data, its comprehensive and integrated AI offerings make it a compelling choice.Moreover, Salesforce's strong financial discipline and commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders make it an attractive investment option. While there are challenges ahead, Salesforce's strategic focus on innovation, automation, and shareholder value positions it well for sustainable growth in the coming years.Impressive financial disciplineDespite the economic challenges, Salesforce's second-quarter fiscal 2024 results exceeded expectations. The company reported an 11% year-over-year increase in revenue to $8.6 billion, surpassing the management's guidance. The GAAP-based operating profit margin was 17.2%, a significant increase from 5% in the first quarter. This performance prompted an upgrade in the company's guidance for the full fiscal year, projecting an 11% revenue increase from $34.7 billion to $34.8 billion.Story continuesThis financial discipline is reflected in Salesforce's approach to addressing the slowing global economy. As organizations delay new software deployments and conserve cash, the company is innovating its software suite to provide automation solutions. Generative AI, embodied by OpenAI's ChatGPT, is integrated throughout many of Salesforce's services, making its software more predictive and insightful.Innovation through AISalesforce has consistently led the charge in terms of innovation. From its beginnings, it transformed the software landscape by providing software as a service during an era dominated by bundled software and hardware. Now, the company is once again setting the pace by integrating AI into its offerings.With Einstein, Salesforce is not merely reacting to the market trends, but actively shaping them. It is a bold move, especially considering AI and data privacy controversies. However, Salesforce has always been known for its proactive approach to data security and user privacy. The company is continuously investing in AI and machine learning capabilities and recently made headlines by acquiring the AI company Datorama and integrating its technology into its marketing cloud.A holistic approachSalesforce's approach to AI is not just about integrating the technology into its existing services, but also developing a holistic strategy encompassing every aspect of its business. From sales and customer service to marketing and analytics, the company is leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and provide better customer value. This approach is paying off. Customers using Salesforce's AI-powered features have seen significant improvements in their operations. For example, companies using Einstein's prediction builder have been able to predict customer churn with an accuracy of up to 95%.Return to shareholdersSalesforce's commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders is another positive sign for investors. The company's first share buyback program is a vote of confidence in its stock and a sign that management believes the shares are undervalued. This move also aligns with Salesforce's history of prudent capital management. The company has consistently generated strong cash flows and maintained a healthy balance sheet.Competitive landscapeSalesforce distinguishes itself in a fiercely competitive market where companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) constantly innovate their services. While others focus on specific AI use cases, Salesforce integrates AI across its entire product and service suite, creating more customer value and a competitive edge for the company.This edge is highlighted by Salesforce's financial performance over the past three years, signifying its competitiveness in the software industry. It achieved a three-year revenue growth rate (per share) of 16.1%, outperforming 67.74% of companies in the software industry, while its three-year Ebitda growth rate (per share) of 22.8% surpasses 70.49% of competitors, indicating strong revenue and Ebitda growth and its ability to generate shareholder value.Additionally, Salesforce's future three to five-year earnings per share without nonrecurring items growth rate stands at 20.05%, ranking better than 66.95% of peers. This suggests robust earnings growth in the upcoming years, enhancing its investment appeal.Further, Salesforce has been profitable for seven out of the past 10 years, outperforming 60.28% of software companies. This long-term profitability underscores the company's capacity to generate sustained profits, which are crucial for its long-term viability.Challenges aheadThe journey forward, however, presents numerous obstacles as infusing AI into Salesforce's offerings comes with multiple barriers.First, there is a substantial learning curve tied to utilizing AI-driven instruments. Clients must grasp how to decipher the outcomes produced by these instruments and how to fold them into their decision-making procedures.Data quality also poses a considerable challenge. The effectiveness of AI models hinges on the quality of the data they are trained on. A multitude of organizations continue to grapple with data that is incomplete, inconsistent or incorrect.Salesforce is confronting these issues by pouring resources into education and training and furnishing tools to enhance data quality.TakeawayIn conclusion, Salesforce's strategic integration of AI, improving financial discipline and competitive valuation make it a compelling potential investment. Despite challenges, the company's focus on innovation, automation and returning excess cash to shareholders positions it well for sustainable growth in a new era for the cloud.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
53,93b63245-0a99-3f6f-958f-bbdcdce65b7e,CRM,2023-09-09,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Salesforce.com Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-salesforce-123003057.html,1694176203,STORY,['CRM'],"[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.Story continuesThere are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services &amp; Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services &amp; Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Salesforce.com, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in September 2013 would be worth $4,591.09, or a gain of 359.11%, as of September 8, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 168.92% and gold's return of 32.70% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for CRM too.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and placed at a better competitive position against Microsoft’s Teams product. Shares of the company have outperformed the industry year to date. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects in the near-term.Shares have gained 6.86% over the past four weeks and there have been 17 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

59,0f3ff347-2261-3a0d-9209-d3ead017a554,NWS,2023-09-09,Murdoch lieutenant says AI churns out ‘maggot-ridden mind mould’,The Telegraph,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/0f3ff347-2261-3a0d-9209-d3ead017a554/murdoch-lieutenant-says-ai.html,1694235600.0,STORY,"['NWSA', 'GOOGL']","[News Corp boss Robert Thomson has warned that artificial intelligence could unleash a new wave of job losses in the media industryOne of Rupert Murdoch’s top lieutenants has warned that AI threatens a “tsunami” of job losses and could crush readers under a weight of “maggot-ridden mind mould.”News Corporation chief executive Robert Thomson this week told a conference in San Francisco that the rapid rise of artificial intelligence was “epochal”.Thomson said that AI will lead to a “tsunami” of job losses. “From 2008 to 2020, 57pc of newsroom jobs in the United States have been lost,” he said.“We’re facing another wave, in this case, a tsunami potentially of job losses because of the impact of AI. And these are not just jobs lost, but it’s insight lost. And so it’s important that all media companies understand the impact, but also, it’s incumbent on the big AI players to understand their impact.”While warnings about AI job losses are not limited to newsrooms, Thomson warned that there was a greater societal risk: that we will become deluged by a stream of AI-generated “rubbish”.“People have to understand that AI is essentially retrospective. It’s about permutations of pre-existing content. And the danger is, it’s rubbish in, rubbish out, and in this case, rubbish all about,” Thomson said.“Instead of elevating and enhancing, what you might find is that you have this ever shrinking cycle of sanity surrounded by a reservoir of rubbish. That instead of the insight that AI can potentially bring, it will evolve into essentially a maggot-ridden mind mould.”Concerns about technology are not new. Rupert Murdoch has spent much of the last decade and a half at war with Google, claiming the internet giant has been ripping off his content.The Australian media tycoon has called the search engine a “parasite” and “kleptomaniac”, accusing it of stealing work from a newspaper empire that includes The Times, The Sun, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.Rupert Murdoch has clashed with Google for over a decade over the tech giants usage of News Corp content - Victoria Jones/PA WireMurdoch briefly went so far as to block Google from including The Times within its search results. His company, News Corporation, complained to the European Commission, accusing Google of exploiting “a dominant market position to stifle competition”.Story continuesHis hard line has seen results:  Australia, where Murdoch retains a lasting influence, introduced pioneering laws that effectively make Google and Facebook pay for news in 2021.After a stand-off, Google backed down, striking deals with dozens of outlets. Now, countries around the world are following, and News Corp and Google have signed a multi-year partnership deal that involves “significant payments” from the tech company.While AI now poses a fresh threat, there is also an opportunity.Mr Thomson told shareholders last month that it would allow the company to reduce costs. He has suggested that this will be in back office functions, although the company’s local Australian titles are already using AI to author stories about weather and fuel prices.Murdoch’s loudest critics would find it ironic that Thomson is complaining about AI poisoning people’s minds. But most would concede that he has a point.While chatbots such as ChatGPT can appear omniscient, at a fundamental level they are simply consuming and repackaging huge quantities of existing knowledge that they have already ingested. Creating that knowledge is another matter altogether.Major news sites such as the New York Times, Reuters and CNN have already begun blocking ChatGPT software that scours the web for material to ingest.That may only be an initial step. The New York Times is reportedly considering legal action against OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT as negotiations between the companies over a licensing deal fail to bear fruit.In July, The Telegraph revealed that DMGT, the owner of the Daily Mail, was considering potential action against Google for using its online articles to train its ChatGPT competitor, Bard.News Corp, despite Murdoch’s previous fiery past rhetoric against Google, has been less confrontational.“What you will see over time, [is] a lot of litigation,” Thomson said. “Some media companies have already begun those discussions. Personally, we’re not interested in that at this stage. We’re much more interested in negotiation, and we have various negotiations going on.”News organisations including the Associated Press have already agreed deals with OpenAI.However, Thomson is likely to strike a hard bargain. His critique is not only that AI companies are scraping huge quantities of copyrighted data, but that it is producing biased content that is corrosive to society.Woke chatbotThomson has complained about what he sees as AI programmes “churning out… left wing” articles.In a separate talk, he added: “It really is incumbent on these companies to recognise that responsibility in the end to their own products and certainly, to society.”These comments may be directed at regulators.Britain’s Intellectual Property Office, among others, is currently assessing how copyright laws apply to AI.Murdoch’s fight with search engines may have reached a truce.

For us, it actually starts to unleash unique data. We are the local knowledge graph. So I think the value of what we do starts to really shine forth. We're the only platform where you're finding out what's going on around you locally in real time.So with that data, we can do things like on the platform help a neighbor compose a post in a way that is more engaging. So the assistant or the AI actually does that for you.KELLY STECKELBERG: There's lots of interesting discussions we can have around AI. So we announced just this morning, Zoom AI companion, which is our answer to how generative AI is going to be included in our platform.And there's all kinds of really cool features that come with that for our paid subscribers. There are things like chat compose, if you're in the chat thread and you want to be able to respond to that.

It's really a breakthrough in computer science. And it impacts not only the products, but it impacts how software is created.ROBERT THOMSON: There certainly needs to be a lot of debate about AI and journalism. 57% of newsroom jobs in the United States have been lost. We're facing another wave, in this case, a tsunami potentially of job losses because of the impact of AI. And these are not just jobs lost, but it's inside lost. It's important that all media companies understand the impact. But also, it's incumbent on the big AI players to understand their impact.SASAN GOODARZI: We launched Intuit Assist. An Intuit Assist is really a personalized intelligent assistant in your pocket. It's also powered by AI-driven human experts. So that when you are getting assistance from Intuit Assist, if you ever need to talk to an expert, no matter what it is that you're doing, you're able to do that. So there's always a gateway to help.GEORGE ARISON: AI is going to change this whole industry completely. And so we're thinking a lot about how do we use AI to match people a lot better and to support the conversations that are happening.I think conversational AI is also a big opportunity because people do produce all these messages. So helping them craft those messages, make it easier to communicate, I think, is something people will really appreciate as well.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the instant messaging market, you can go directly to see 5 Countries with Most WhatsApp Users in 2023.As the most popular messaging app, WhatsApp is used by people all over the world. It is especially popular in countries where there is a high penetration of smartphones and where data costs are relatively low. The popularity of WhatsApp is due to its ease of use, its free messaging features, and its support for group chats.The Instant Messaging App Market: A Growing IndustryThe COVID-19 crisis had a positive influence on the instant messaging app market. While the pandemic caused huge losses for businesses around the world and hurt many industries and markets, it gave rise to the unfavorable circumstances for many people to stay at home. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in the use of instant messaging apps. These apps provided a much-needed source of entertainment and relaxation to people who were looking for ways to stay connected with loved ones and others they could not meet in person.According to a report by Business Research Insights, the global instant messaging app market was valued at $24.21 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% during 2022-2028, propelling the market to reach around $41.23 billion by the end of the forecasted period. With many people working from home, the shift towards remote work accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Messaging apps became an important instrument for remote teams to collaborate and communicate effectively. Many businesses and teams now rely on messaging apps to maintain communication with their workforce and colleagues, making the instant messaging app market more critical than ever. Moreover, the lines between social media and messaging apps are blurring. Messaging apps make headway as they evolve to incorporate social media features, which makes them more appealing to consumers, especially the younger generations. This trend has been a key factor driving growth in the instant messaging app market, and it is expected to continue during the forecast period.Story continuesIn one of our previous articles about countries with the most smartphone users, we briefly discussed an upcoming trend in the form of a surge in smartphone usage. With the increasing availability of smartphones the number of smartphone users worldwide is expected to continue growing. More people will have access to mobile apps, including messenger apps, which will drive the demand for instant messaging. Notable players in the instant messaging app market that are expected to benefit during the forecast period include Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).The instant messaging market is subject to various regulations. These regulations can be related to data protection, privacy, and content moderation, and compliance with these regulations can prove to be costly and challenging for messaging service providers. Such regulations can limit the growth potential of the instant messaging app market.On September 6, Reuters reported that as part of its latest crackdown on Big Tech, the European Union has picked out 22 ""gatekeeper"" services to face new rules. The Digital Markets Act (DMA), designed to level the playing field between the tech giants and smaller competitors, will apply to services from Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among others. Under the DMA, companies with a market capitalisation of EUR 75 billion and more than 45 million monthly active users will be labeled as “gatekeepers”. These corporations will be required to make their messaging apps interoperate with competitors and let consumers decide which apps they want to pre-install on their devices. Corporations that fail to comply can be fined up to 10% of their annual global turnover.With regards to Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) very own instant messaging service, an Apple spokesperson said:""iMessage is designed and marketed for personal consumer communications, and we look forward to explaining to the commission why iMessage is outside the scope of the DMA.”In a separate post, on August 31, Reuters reported that in an effort to avoid a possible EU antitrust fine, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has agreed to unbundle its Teams chat and video app from its Office product and make it easier for competing products to work with its software. According to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Microsoft Teams has an instant messaging platform and allows for communication and collaboration in real time. The report by Reuters also mentions that the changes, effective from October 1, will apply in the EU and Switzerland. Customers will be allowed to switch to a version of Office that excludes Teams at a price EUR 2 per month cheaper than with Teams.

It has been almost a decade since Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, announced his company’s $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, a tiny business but a popular messaging app. Facebook and WhatsApp are both owned and operated by Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META).On September 1, CNBC reported that over half of the world’s 5.3 billion internet users are on WhatsApp, making it the world’s largest social messaging app. According to Alex Newton-Rex, Head of Product at WhatsApp, WhatsApp already had around 200 million users at the time of its acquisition in 2014. Usage has surged over the years and now more than 2 billion people use the messaging app. However, WhatsApp’s true value to Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has long been unclear as the company doesn’t reveal the size of the business. Nick Lane, founder and chief insight analyst of research firm Mobilesquared, estimates its revenue to be between $500 million and $1 billion, a very tiny portion of Meta Platforms Inc. 's (NASDAQ:META) overall revenue, which was $116.6 billion in 2022.The report also mentions that the company is rolling out new features, such as Channels. WhatsApp’s Channels feature will allow users to get updates from individuals, business, or organizations like sports teams, in a newsfeed-like format. This feature is available in Singapore and Colombia. WhatsApp is also getting into payments, allowing users to link their bank accounts and send money through the chat interface, and this feature is currently available in India, Brazil, and Singapore.When it comes to revenue growth, WhatsApp is focused on its business messaging platform, which it has been expanding for the past few years in markets like Brazil, India, and Indonesia. WhatsApp charges medium to large companies on every conversation they have with customers, and the fee varies depending on the country and the type of conversation. Lane says that about 95% of the business messaging spending is concentrated on standard SMS messaging. He expects this figure to drop down to around 75% in the next 4 years as more brands turn to WhatsApp. As a business messaging platform, WhatsApp hopes to offer a richer experience with features that are not available with standard SMS messaging.The current market is dominated by regular SMS messaging, and the future of business messaging through WhatsApp is uncertain. This is especially true in the US, where WhatsApp has not yet gained widespread adoption.Nick Lane also said that he expects WhatsApp to grow, with growth of business messaging on the app, to about $7 billion - $10 billion over the next 5-6 years. By 2027, Lane expects WhatsApp will have around 4.1 billion users, and expects more and more brands to invest in the platform. Lane also expects the business messaging market value to reach around $50 billion in 4-5 years time. Business messaging at WhatsApp has experienced substantial growth. Here are some comments from Meta Platforms Inc. 's (NASDAQ:META) Q2 2023 earnings call:“Business messaging is another key piece of our monetization strategy. We recently announced that the 200 million users of our WhatsApp Business app will now be able to create click-to-WhatsApp ads for Facebook and Instagram without needing a Facebook account. This is a pretty big unlock, particularly in countries where WhatsApp is often the first step to bringing a business online.Paid messaging is a bit earlier, but it's also showing good adoption. The number of businesses using our paid messaging products has doubled year-over-year. While we're on messaging, I'll mention that we started rolling out channels on WhatsApp last month. It's a simple, reliable and private way to receive important updates from people and organizations. And I'm quite excited for more people to try it as we bring the product to more countries through the rest of this year.”On July 26, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.98, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.09. The company reported a revenue of $32 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $969.07 million.Now that we've discussed some of the recent trends in the global instant messaging app market, let's take a look at the 20 countries with most WhatsApp users in 2023.20 Countries with Most WhatsApp Users in 2023Pixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 20 countries with most WhatsApp users in 2023.

There DOJ, along with more than 30 state Attorneys General, are accusing Google using contracts with companies such as Apple (AAPL) that require Google to be the default search engine in a bid to dominate internet search. The trial is set to begin on Tuesday, September 12th in Washington, DC. Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan explains how Google will try to defend itself, saying the company is ""not challenging that they actually have monopolies in these markets, but instead what the company says is that their conduct in these markets, in these monopolies, isn't harming competition, that's they key there"".Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are set to face what could be their toughest legal challenge yet, a trial against the Department of Justice. In 2020, the DOJ sued Google saying it had broken the competition law by illegally blocking competition in the online search market. Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan is here with what to expect. Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Akiko. Yeah, so this trial, it kicks off on Tuesday. And it is going to happen in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, as you said, brought by the Justice Department but also by 30-plus US State attorneys general. And they say that Google is abusing its monopolies in the markets for-- they're three of them. Its search engines, search engine advertising, and search engine text advertising.Now, take a look in 2022 search advertising generated more than $160 billion in revenue for Google. That's more than half of the company's $280 billion in total revenue for the year. And in terms of volume, Google processes almost all of the searches in the US.They process approximately 89% of all searches on mobile alone. Take a look at that. It's a growing market of concern for the DOJ and the states. In that respect, they process 95% of all search queries online. The next largest competitors in search, Microsoft's Bing at 6.4%. And you can see there Yahoo's affiliate company Yahoo Search at 2.3%. Globally, Google has less of an advantage at 83% and Bing at 9%, Yahoo at 3%. Also DuckDuckGo is in there at just under 1%.Story continuesSo what the government say is illegal here are contracts that Google enters into for computer devices, mobile devices, also browser services, browser developers, and also wireless carriers. These contracts, they require Google search to be the default programmed into these devices.And some of those companies that enter into these contracts, they're the common names, Apple, LG, Samsung, on the US wireless carrier front, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, also browser Mozilla. So Google, here they're not challenging that they actually have monopolies in these markets. But instead, what the company says is that their conduct in these markets, in these monopolies isn't harming competition. That's the key there.But largely, these complaints are saying that it's Google's search, its main search function, that is allowing it to also grab these advertising dollars. But the fundamental here is the search. And in the complaint, it's very telling that the DOJ and the states, they call it the cornerstone of Google's entire empire. Guys.AKIKO FUJITA: A lot riding on this case for both sides. We'll all be watching. Alexis Keenan, as always, thanks so much for that.]"

But there’s another segment of the workforce that’s had enough of the couch potato life: retired boomers..Nearly half (44%) of current retirees have plans to reenter the workforce or are strongly considering it, according to a June 2023 study by Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Life Insurance Company. With the current average U.S. retirement age hovering around 64, that means those coming out of retirement are almost entirely Baby Boomers. To be sure, a healthy portion of those folks are likely pursuing work for economic reasons. Perhaps they assumed that they’d saved adequately for retirement, only to realize their expenses vastly outweighed their savings.The latest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics supports this, as the unemployment rate actually ticked up slightly to 3.8%, with economists finding a good reason for it: More people were looking for work in August, meaning a technically higher unemployment rate. In other words, many boomers are tiring of the couch life.Most commonly, the Fidelity study found, inflation has impacted retirees’ savings, and they don’t want to rely on just the fixed income that a pension and/or Social Security provide. But others, F&amp;G wrote, were motivated to return to the office for the lifestyle it affords: Socializing, a renewed sense of purpose, and new social and professional connections.The “unretiring” trend has been a long time coming. Last spring, CNBC said the combined forces of a booming labor market, soaring inflation, and “fading Covid fears” were the main impetus for Boomers to dust off their business casual garb. Unretirement, which saw a similar jolt following the 2008 financial crises, “is emblematic [of] the labor market overall, which is seeing increasing labor force participation for a broad swath of workers,” Nick Bunker, Indeed’s North American economic research director, told CNBC.Story continuesEven now, and is likely to gain greater momentum as offices (at least some of them) fill up in earnest. According to a February 2023 study by Paychex, one in 6 retirees said they’re considering returning to work—but just 20% of them said they were seeking a fully in-person job.The majority of retirees told Paychex they returned to work for the obvious reason: They needed more money. But other factors were also top of mind: more Paychex respondents said they were unretiring because they were bored or lonely than because of inflation. Sadly, the office may not be the answer to their woes; three-quarters of unretirees said they felt judged by their coworkers because of their age, and over 60% of hiring managers admitted to having concerns about older applicants.James Reed, CEO of U.K.-based recruitment firm Reed, told Fortune in January how critical it is for companies to overcome ageism. “The skill set that older workers offer, including a different yet valuable perspective on workplace decisions and a substantial level of experience, should not be understated. Older workers are invaluable, and companies should think creatively about appealing to this group.”That could mean doing away with frustrating advanced technology of screening that would frustrate or confuse older workers, and making an effort to encourage bonding and understanding among a multigenerational workforce.But it’s not all such a tragic tale. While some would say that the thought of Boomers applying for a job would be demoralizing or a grim reflection of the state of the U.S. economy, the unretirees themselves don’t feel that way. The top three emotions associated with returning to the workforce, per Paychex, were happy (60%), energized (50%) and excited (48%). Later down the list came resigned, anxious, frustrated and insecure.In a 2022 Joblist survey, the majority of unretirees (60%) said they were simply “looking for something to do.” That something could be more meaningful than it sounds. Jackie Anscher, a 60-year-old spin instructor, told the New York Times she felt forced into an early retirement when COVID lockdowns shuttered fitness studios. Returning to the bike, she said, returned to her a sense of identity. “It’s about my mental health,” she said. “For me, it’s about preserving me.” It remains to be seen how well self-preservation will endure against post-pandemic rush hour traffic.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

PAYX currently has a PEG ratio of 3.42.Another notable valuation metric for CGEMY is its P/B ratio of 3.04. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

Despite the possibility of more near-term uncertainty, volatility, and selling, the overall upbeat backdrop that drove much of the 2023 rally remains in place.Therefore, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying proven S&amp;P 500 stocks that are trading at levels that could look like steals years or even months from now. The three stocks we explore today are Starbucks (SBUX), Paycom Software (PAYC), and Public Storage (PSA).The recent downturn in the early days of a traditionally poor month for stocks has seen the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq slide back below their 50-day moving averages. The bulls might have to hold their ground in the lead-up to the August CPI release on September 13. Yet, the nearby chart showcases how the Nasdaq is interacting with its 21-week moving average (red line) and why it might indicate more bullishness going forward.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNow might be a time for investors to take a giant step back and remember to block out the constant noise and look to the two biggest drivers of stock prices: earnings and interest rates.Zacks estimates call for S&amp;P 500 earnings to soar 11.7% in 2024 and another 10.9% in 2025 vs. a projected decline of -3.2% in 2023. And Jay Powell and Co. remain near the end of their tightening cycle.Rates might have to stay higher for longer as the U.S. economy remains resilient. In fact, the higher rates signal ongoing strength and growth, which further supports the soft landing that more Wall Street giants are calling for.All told, it might be time for investors to take one of Warren Buffett’s most used mantras to heart and “be greedy when others are fearful” and start looking at large-cap S&amp;P 500 stocks that have fallen out of favor and are trading at levels that might look likes steals years from now.Story continuesStarbucks (SBUX) is the coffee shop powerhouse that boasts over 37,000 stores globally. The company has grown at an impressive clip for over 20 years to become one of the most valuable brands in the world. SBUX’s e-commerce, delivery, and other digital initiatives have helped it thrive in the changing retail environment, with its app one of the most downloaded food and drink apps in the world last year, behind only McDonald’s (MCD), Uber Eats, and DoorDash.Starbucks topped our Q3 FY23 earnings estimates in early August, as it showcased impressive resilience amid slowing consumer spending, with global comparable sales up 10%. SBUX is improving how its stores and supply chains operate and working on expanding in smaller cities and towns. Some are worried about consumers in its two largest markets—the U.S. and China—but Zacks estimates call for it to post 11% YoY revenue growth both this year and next to help boot its adjusted earnings by around 17% each year.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStarbucks, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has soared 1,200% over the last 20 years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 350% and McDonald’s 1,100%. Yet, SBUX trades 25% below its peaks and 21% under its average Zacks price target. Some investors might want to wait for it to cross above some key moving averages. But coffee isn’t going out of style and neither is Starbucks. SBUX is also trading at a 36% discount its highs and 10% below its 10-year median at 23.8X forward earnings.Paycom Software (PAYC) was a pioneer in digital HR and payroll technology over 20 years ago. Paycom’s cloud software today helps with onboarding, benefits enrollment, talent management, and beyond. PAYC and other similar software are now deeply embedded and essential at companies big and small. And Paycom’s decade of impressive double-digit revenue growth backs up its value and vital nature.Paycom topped our Q2 earnings and sales estimates in early August and upped its guidance as it expands its total addressable market to “include larger North American organizations with both domestic and foreign employees.” Zacks estimates call for it to post 25% revenue and earnings growth this year and 21% higher sales and EPS in 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaycom stock has skyrocketed since its 2014 IPO, but it is currently trading 50% below its record highs. The downturn, coupled with its earnings outlook helps its valuation look far more reasonable. Plus, PAYC earlier this year began to pay a dividend for the first time to highlight its overall financial strength.Public Storage (PSA) is one of the largest self-storage companies in the country, with roughly 3,000 facilities in the U.S. and almost two million customers. PSA is a REIT that’s been gaining momentum for years as Americans continue to buy tons of stuff, big and small. The company’s revenue has soared over the last 20-plus years, including 22% growth in 2022.Zacks estimates call for PSA to post 8% revenue growth in FY23 and 6% higher sales in FY24, which would mark stronger expansion compared to the several-year stretch prior to its Covid boom. Public Storage’s adjusted FFO (which are essentially earnings for REITs) are projected to climb by roughly 5% during both years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPSA shares have climbed 600% over the last 20 years to crush the benchmark. Public Storage is still up nearly 30% in the past three years even though it is down 35% from its peaks. PSA is currently trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple since the initial Covid crash (15.5X), which puts it at decade-long lows even though the stock has climbed 75% in the past 10 year. Plus, Public Storage lifted its dividend by 50% earlier this year, with it yielding 4.5% at the moment.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The companies' actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages.

The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Soft drink companies have been gaining from improved demand trends, aiding volume growth.

Hours earlier, CFM International Inc., the joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA that makes the engines for many older-generation Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft, said parts with fraudulent documentation had been put on 68 of its power plants.The widening scandal has shaken an industry where safety is the guiding principle, with exacting standards for aircraft manufacturing and maintenance that demands each component be verified. Regulators, airlines and other industry players have been scouring their records to hunt down the suspect components sold by AOG, the obscure supplier at the center of the crisis.CFM, the world’s largest jet-engine manufacturer, filed a lawsuit in the UK against AOG Technics. The suit seeks an injunction to force AOG to provide more information to aid the aviation industry’s search for suspect components. It also seeks to recover any parts in AOG’s possession purported to be from CFM or GE.In response to questions from Bloomberg News, which first reported on the AOG case, Southwest said that two low-pressure turbine blades were the components it pulled from one of its engines. The carrier took “precautionary and immediate measures” to remove them based on the fact they were supplied by AOG.Story continuesThe parts were found in an engine on a Boeing 737 NG, an older version of Boeing’s most popular model. CFM supplies engines to both the Airbus and the Boeing planes. In the last decade, both models have undergone a technical upgrade with new engines — the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max — that use different powerplants not affected by the AOG case.Still, the CFM56 model is the most widely used jet engine in service today. It has been used on single-aisle planes for decades, with more than 33,000 engines delivered to more than 600 operators worldwide. The single-aisle Airbus and Boeing jets are used by millions of passengers each day and by most airlines, mainly on short-haul flights.To date, CFM and GE Aerospace have found 78 documents they say are falsified and which cover 52 CFM56 engine part numbers, along with two faked records for CF6 components. AOG has no direct affiliation with CFM or its partners.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency earlier this week determined that the components backed by forged documentation included turbine blades, a critical component of an aircraft’s propulsion system.Airbus has said it’s aware of reports surrounding AOG, while Boeing has deferred to regulators on the topic.Representatives for AOG could not be reached for immediate comment. Based on the UK’s Companies House records, AOG was established in 2015. The supplier of parts to third-party engine repair shops was created by Jose Zamora Yrala, who hasn’t responded to emails or phone calls seeking comment.“Safety is our first priority, and we are taking aggressive legal action against AOG Technics to accelerate the industry’s ability to identify parts sold by this third-party with falsified documentation,” a CFM spokesman said in a statement.No incidents linked to the suspect parts have been identified, CFM and GE have said. EASA said last week that while the parts of questionable origin are “a matter for concern, to date there have been no reports of problems resulting from the suspect unapproved parts.”Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and engine makers go to great lengths inspecting their equipment to identify faults or fatigue, a practice that has contributed to ever-lower incidents in an industry priding itself as being among the safest modes of transport. When unforeseen faults to crop up — even those that are not deemed a safety issue — they can lead to lengthy and costly repairs.--With assistance from Albertina Torsoli.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutJames Dolan’s $2.3 Billion Sphere Is Raising Eyebrows—in a Good WayInvestors Stand by Israel’s Tech Startups, for NowGoodbye, California.

Hawaiian Holdings HA, meanwhile, revised its projections downward for key metrics for third-quarter as well as full-year 2023.The devastation caused by wildfire to the Lahaina town in West Maui resulted in dull projections. Also, issues with RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney engines that power Airbus' popular A320neo jets added to the woes. We note that HA’s fleet includes A320neo jets with engines, which need to be inspected following problems identified by Pratt &amp; Whitney.

The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in August was 18.9 million, implying that 12% more passengers flew than a year ago. This was an all-time monthly high traffic number.

85,8fe76783-be90-3518-876b-760feb0cc47d,WU,2023-09-09,There's A Lot To Like About Western Union's (NYSE:WU) Upcoming US$0.23 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-western-unions-nyse-121220446.html,1694261540,STORY,['WU'],"[Readers hoping to buy The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Western Union's shares before the 14th of September to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.23 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$0.94 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Western Union has a trailing yield of 7.4% on the current stock price of $12.78. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Western Union's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Western Union can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Western Union Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Fortunately Western Union's payout ratio is modest, at just 47% of profit.Generally speaking, the lower a company's payout ratios, the more resilient its dividend usually is.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Fortunately for readers, Western Union's earnings per share have been growing at 15% a year for the past five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Western Union has increased its dividend at approximately 8.9% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.To Sum It UpShould investors buy Western Union for the upcoming dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares. In summary, Western Union appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Western Union is facing. Be aware that Western Union is showing 4 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 3 of those are concerning...A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

A concept store provides access to personalized, safe and seamless money transfer services in a high-traffic area. WU currently has 70-plus such stores located worldwide.The new hub in Jordan will be situated in Industrial City of Sahab and aims to cater to the worker community belonging from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Myanmar, Nepal, Egypt and Syria. As consumers of the Middle East region desire to be equipped with the flexibility to choose between in-person and digital channels while sending and receiving money, the idea of Western Union to open the concept store in one of the region’s countries seems to be time opportune.The latest move reflects Western Union’s sincere efforts to take into consideration the preferences as well as requirements of consumers and subsequently, provide accelerated and varied money transfer choices across Jordan. Such efforts also provide an opportunity to the money transfer services provider to widen its customer base and bring higher money transfer revenues through increased utilization of its services. Money transfer revenues remain the most significant contributor to WU’s top line.Concept stores are also a means of Western Union’s growth-related investments as they usually boost its worldwide retail presence. It has an extensive network of retail locations stretched across 200-plus countries and territories. This year, concept stores were also launched by Western Union in Italy and Spain, probably as an effort to strengthen its retail presence throughout Europe.Western Union remains steadfast in establishing a solid footprint in Jordan and the recent partnership only bears testament to the same. The reason behind its intensified focus on the Middle East nation follows the fact that remittances in Jordan witnessed a 5.9% year-over-year improvement in June 2023, according to the Central Bank of Jordan. Therefore, WU can capitalize on the remittance growth potential of the country by providing a convenient access to enhanced money transfer services.Story continuesA solid cross-border money transfer platform built on the back of several partnerships and significant investments enables Western Union in bringing about seamless money movement to and from any corner of the world. It leaves no stone unturned to collaborate with retail chains or financial services providers with an aim to further fortify its worldwide network. Apart from a broad network of retail locations, consumers can also engage in speedy money transfer services through the Western Union app. Shares of Western Union have gained 11.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 10.1% growth.

88,31884019-7edd-3ce1-ba98-9429d2610b26,GS,2023-09-09,Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on new $100 million investment in rural America,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/goldman-sachs-ceo-solomon-sees-184729391.html,1694198849,VIDEO,['GS'],"[Goldman Sachs is betting big on small business. The bank is investing $100 million in small businesses in rural communities across the U.S., starting in Arkansas and North Dakota. Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO David Solomon says the goal is to help small business owners who may not have the same access to resources that their counterparts in large cities due.When it comes to Goldman Sachs' (GS) business, Solomon admits it has been a ""tough year for capital markets activity."" There is some reason for optimism, with Arm and Instacart readying to make thier market debuts. If those go well, Solomon tells Yahoo Finance, it could create a ""virtuous cycle of bringing some of the other IPOs that are in the wings waiting to market."" ""I do see a pickup in capital markets activity during the course of the fall,"" Solomon says, though it may not get back to normalized levels. Solomon says that right now, the bank is focusing on its investment banking and markets business and its asset wealth management business.Key video moments00:00:05 Goldman Sachs small business investment00:03:50 Solomon on investment banking, upcoming IPOs00:05:25 Solomon discuss U.S.-China relations00:06:37 Solomon on the consumer business00:08:30 Solomon on some of the speculation surrounding Goldman Sachs and his leadershipVideo TranscriptDAVID SOLOMON: I think that the firm, for over 15 years, has been incredibly committed to our 10,000 small business program. We've brought the program to over 14,000 small businesses across the country. And the history of the program and the way we rolled the program out over the last 15 years is we went into cities around the country to really increase business education for small businesses.And as we're looking to expand further, one of the things we think is desperately needed is help for businesses in rural parts of the country where they don't have the same access to resources that they might have in some of the cities.Story continuesAnd so back in 19-- back in 2021, Senator Cramer invited me out to North Carolina-- out to North Dakota. I'm sorry, North Dakota. And we had a good meeting out here where we spent some time talking about small businesses here. We were thinking a lot about what we could do more broadly to expand our 10,000 small business program.And we really saw that there was a real need. When you look broadly across the country, and you look at a state like North Dakota and also Arkansas, which is the second State we're rolling this additional program out to that we announced today, 99% of all the businesses in these states are small businesses.You know, it's pretty consistent across the country that small businesses drive a lot of the jobs in the United States. 42% of all employment in the United States comes from companies that employ less than 50 people. And so as we wanted to expand 10,000 small businesses, we thought we should develop a program that could really support it in rural communities.We decided to start with North Dakota and Arkansas. But we certainly have plans to roll it out to other states shortly, including South Dakota and other states in the midwest that we're targeting. We've done a bunch of research. We've had about 75 meetings to look at where we think there's need.And we're excited that this $100 million commitment today, which $75 million goes to fund CDFIs, $15 million to fund the community colleges that support the educational effort, and $10 million to make capital more accessible. We think this is a good start to expand the program rurally.And that $75 million of grants to CDFIs brings our total commitment to CDFIs through this program up to $1.6 billion. So we think this can continue to have a broader impact on small businesses across the country that generates obviously economic growth. And we think it's very important for the economic ecosystem of the United States.- I talked to your chief economist Jan Hatzius at the tech conference. Now, he lowered, this week, his recession odds from, I think, I believe it was from 20% to 15%. So a little bit better there. But when you talk to small businesses, are they still worried about a recession and what's the economic vibe from that small business customer?DAVID SOLOMON: Sure, so Jan did lower his economic prediction for recession. There's no question, the US economy has been a lot more resilient over the last 12 months than we would have expected. And I think the chance for a softer landing right now is much higher than we would have anticipated a year ago.That said, small businesses feel the brunt of inflation, higher interest rates much more directly than large organizations. They don't have the flexibility or the nimbleness or the resources to necessarily brave those headwinds so quickly. I think we all know that the pandemic was devastating to small businesses across the United States.A lot of them are service businesses that definitely lost their ability to serve customers during the pandemic. They had to save more aggressively to keep their businesses growing. And so small businesses have definitely had a bumpy ride over the course of the last few years.There's no question as the economy has done better, they are experiencing this softer landing environment. But they definitely have more headwinds than the larger enterprises across the country.- If the economy has hit that soft landing position, David, what is your outlook for that bread and butter investment banking business over the next six months? Of course, a lot of excitement around the Arm deal, Instacart, you name it. So we're starting to see some big names in that private market come to public market or at least very soon. Do you see that IPO market and the investment banking business starting to turn around?DAVID SOLOMON: Well, we've been through a really tough year for capital markets activity. We went from a very robust environment in 2021 to obviously a much different environment after the war in Ukraine started and obviously very, very high rampant inflation, a very significant change in posture from the Federal Reserve.If you go back and look at Powell's comments a year ago at Jackson Hole, that decreased confidence significantly. And of course, that closed down M&amp;A activity and capital markets activity. And that activity really in the first half of this year was pretty anemic.We are starting to see a pickup in activity. As you mentioned, there are some very significant IPOs that are in the market this week. The Arm IPO is progressing nicely. And I do believe that if these IPOs go well, that kind of creates a virtuous cycle of bringing some of the other IPOs that are in the wings waiting to market.And so I do see a pickup in capital markets activity during the course of the fall. I can't say that we'll get back to what normalized levels are, but we're really coming off of zero activity. And so we're encouraged by what we see. And obviously, an environment with more capital markets activity is a good environment for Goldman Sachs given our position in those businesses.- Yeah, this pickup in investment banking, good to see. I mean, it's long overdue. But it comes at a time with increased tensions between the US and China. And I hope I got this right. I think Goldman opened its first office in China in 1994. I think-- I hope I did the Yahoo Search right. Apologies if I did not.Nonetheless, you do do business in China. How concerned are you about these increasingly frayed tensions between these two big economic superpowers?DAVID SOLOMON: Well, there's no question that the bilateral relationship between the US and China is something that's getting an awful lot of focus I thought Secretary Raimondo did a terrific job in her visit delivering some very, very important messages.We're significantly intertwined with China economically. Yet from a strategic perspective and a security perspective, we have some very, very important things that we need to move forward to rebalance some of the relationship that we have with China.That-- obviously, that tension and some of those issues as we work through them, those are headwinds to growth. China's economy at the moment, definitely seems softer. That's something that we're attached to. If China catches a cold economically, we're probably going to feel some headwinds to economic activity because of that.So this is something that we all have to watch very closely. But I'm pleased with what I see in the dialogue. But this is going to take some time to sort out.- One year ago-- I think it was about one year ago-- we were talking about your latest 10,000 small businesses. I think it was a DC event. Now, fast forward to today, Goldman is a different business. You've pulled back in the consumer area that more mass market is. Are you totally done in mass market? Do you ever see yourself maybe making a return there at some point once you've made some of these exits more recently?DAVID SOLOMON: Well, we've built a very significant deposit platform in Marcus. And we continue to be in that business. We'll continue to take deposits from the mass market. Our Marcus platform as of our $130 billion of government-guaranteed digital deposits. We pay a very, very attractive rate, I think, to depositors in that platform.We still operate our credit card platforms. But we have scaled back some of our ambitions to be a larger direct-to-consumer platform. And we're really focused on our two principal businesses, our leading investment banking and markets business, which is about 70% of the firm, and our broad global asset and wealth management business where we supervise $2.7 trillion of assets under the fifth largest active asset manager in the world.We see an enormous growth opportunity for the firm in that area. And we're very focused on it. So that's where the lion's share of the firm's focus is at this point in time.- Would there be any interest in acquiring a smaller-- getting into the community banking? If those acquisitions came up-- certainly, a lot of opportunities presented themselves earlier in the year. Is that something that would interest you as a way to more quickly get back into that space?DAVID SOLOMON: Our focus, our strategy is clear. We articulated in our investor day in early February. We are focused on our investment banking and markets business, our primary muscle group. We have a leading franchise and the growth of our asset wealth management business.There'll be other things that we touch on. But those are our primary focus at the moment. We have no plans to make an acquisition of a community bank or a banking institution at this point.- Fair enough. And, David, there's been a lot of just-- I mean, you saw this coming. There's been a lot of just strange stories about Goldman Sachs. And I think Yahoo Finance that our community doesn't really care about any of this stuff. They want to know how your stock is going to do, how your financials are going to perform.But you as a leader, as you look back over the next past few months, how have you changed? Do you see a better path to just sentiment on your leadership and the culture inside of Goldman Sachs?DAVID SOLOMON: Well, I wake up every day focused on Goldman Sachs. And I wake up every day thinking about with my management team, my broad management team. And I'm very fortunate to work with an extraordinary management team across our management committee.I'm very focused on how we serve our clients, serve them with excellence, serve them with distinction, and how also we deliver for shareholders. We're coming up on five years this month. And if you look at this leadership team and the work we've done over the last five years, we've performed for our clients, we've grown our business, we've performed for shareholders. That's what our focus is on and we tend to stay focused on those things. That's the discussion inside Goldman Sachs.- When you sit with investors and you sit with clients and you look them in the eye, do they still have confidence in a Goldman Sachs?DAVID SOLOMON: I think our clients have enormous confidence in Goldman Sachs. The feedback from our clients around Goldman Sachs and the work we do for them continues to be very, very strong. We wake up every day dedicated to serving our clients. I think we do it with excellence, we do it with distinction because the extraordinary people that Goldman Sachs has all over the world.And so we feel very, very good about our client franchise. But we don't take it for granted. We invest in it every day. And I'm very confident that if we continue to serve our clients with distinction, Goldman Sachs will continue to grow and will continue to thrive just as it has for the last 150 years.]"

It is among the banks leading the underwriting for IPOs from SoftBank Group’s Arm Holdings and grocery delivery service Instacart, which would both be among the year's biggest.""Obviously an environment with more capital markets activity is a good environment for Goldman Sachs,"" he said.Solomon is under pressure to improve Goldman's results after reporting the firm's lowest quarterly profits in three years. He is wrestling with everything from job cuts and a two-year-long investment banking slump to reports of partner unrest and questions about his leadership style.He declined during the interview to address some recent media stories about his leadership, saying ""I've talked plenty about the noise and the press."" His focus each day, he said, is on the company and its clients and delivering for shareholders — ""that's the discussion inside Goldman Sachs.""Clients, he added, ""have enormous confidence in Goldman Sachs. The feedback from our clients around Goldman Sachs and the work we do for them continues to be very, very strong.""Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon pictured in April of this year in Washington. (Elizabeth Frantz/REUTERS) (Elizabeth Frantz / reuters)Goldman’s stock is down 5.5% so far this year. It has outperformed Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) while underperforming Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The KBW Nasdaq US bank index (^BKX) is down 21% for the same period.Since Solomon became CEO in October 2018, Goldman's stock is up 45%. That is better than many Wall Street banks, except rivals Morgan Stanley and Jefferies (JEF). The KBW index has fallen 23% over the same time.Story continuesThe new fall lineup of IPOs, which also includes marketing automation software firm Klaviyo and German shoe maker Birkenstock, comes just in time for banks like Goldman that hope to end an extended dealmaking slump that followed a boom in 2021.Clients turned cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy, dampening the optimism needed to go public, buy other companies, or take on more debt.As dealmaking dried up, Goldman and other firms across Wall Street slashed bonuses and staff, announcing cuts of roughly 20,000 jobs since the end of 2022.""We've been through a really tough year for capital markets activity,"" Solomon said Friday.""We went from a very robust environment in 2021 to obviously a much different environment after the war in Ukraine started and obviously ... very, very high rampant inflation"" that the Federal Reserve tried to tamp down with the most aggressive series of interest rate hikes in decades.But the US economy, he said, ""has been a lot more resilient over the last 12 months than we would have expected. I think the chance for a softer landing right now is much higher than we would have anticipated a year ago.""Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius, who has been one of the most outspoken voices on Wall Street about a reduced risk of a recession, lowered expectations for a recession further earlier this week.While Goldman waits out the tepid period of dealmaking, Solomon is also attempting a tricky retreat from a costly push into consumer banking and backing away from offering financial advice to mass market customers so that the firm can focus on its core ultrarich clients.He said Friday that Goldman has no plans to buy a bank and is focused on its principal businesses: investment banking and markets and wealth management.""That's where the lion's share of the firm's focus is at this point in time.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

It is aiming to cut jobs at the lower end of the range, primarily in its main business divisions like investment banking and trading.Markedly, GS has undergone a minimum of three phases of layoffs since last September.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Accordingly, Leggett &amp; Platt investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 13th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.46 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.84 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Leggett &amp; Platt stock has a trailing yield of around 6.9% on the current share price of $26.71. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. As a result, readers should always check whether Leggett &amp; Platt has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Leggett &amp; Platt Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Last year Leggett &amp; Platt paid out 104% of its profits as dividends to shareholders, suggesting the dividend is not well covered by earnings. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (60%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's disappointing to see that the dividend was not covered by profits, but cash is more important from a dividend sustainability perspective, and Leggett &amp; Platt fortunately did generate enough cash to fund its dividend. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. So we're not too excited that Leggett &amp; Platt's earnings are down 4.2% a year over the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Leggett &amp; Platt has delivered 4.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits, spend cash from the balance sheet, or borrow the money. Leggett &amp; Platt is already paying out 104% of its profits, and with shrinking earnings we think it's unlikely that this dividend will grow quickly in the future.To Sum It UpIs Leggett &amp; Platt worth buying for its dividend? It's never fun to see a company's earnings per share in retreat. What's more, Leggett &amp; Platt is paying out a majority of its earnings and over half its free cash flow. It's hard to say if the business has the financial resources and time to turn things around without cutting the dividend. It's not that we think Leggett &amp; Platt is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that being said, if you're still considering Leggett &amp; Platt as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Our analysis shows 3 warning signs for Leggett &amp; Platt and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially.The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of energy produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AstraZeneca’s shares have gained +14.1% over the past year against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s gain of +25.7%.

Almost all non-COVID therapy areas of AstraZeneca demonstrated double-digit revenue growth in the first half of 2023. Its pipeline is strong with important phase III data readouts lined up. It has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline while investing in geographic areas of high growth like emerging markets.

Crackdown on password-sharing and the introduction of paid sharing in more than 100 countries, which represents more than 80% of Netflix’s revenue base, is also expected to aid growth.Netflix’s diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content, has been driving its growth prospects. It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.Nevertheless, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind.

It risks a backlash against both companies.“We’ve almost always avoided these kinds of disputes,” said Christopher Winfrey, president of Charter Communications, during a call with analysts and investors last week. “But we had to draw a line in the sand.“We respect the product that Disney produces, and its management team, but the video ecosystem is broken.”Charter, which boasts 32 million customers across 41 states, says it was left with no choice but to pull Disney’s channels following lengthy and difficult negotiations with Disney over a new contract.Story continuesThe company – which counts Liberty Media, Malone’s main business, as its top shareholder – says Disney is demanding more money for its channels but is refusing to give Charter’s customers access to its streaming service, Disney+.Malone, the billionaire businessman nicknamed the “Cable Cowboy” in the industry, is right to be wary.The rise of streaming services has led to a surge in so-called “cable cutting”, where US households cancel their expensive cable packages and opt for lower cost streaming instead. The trend threatens the bedrock of his business.Charter argues its customers are being double-charged for Disney programmes: once as part of access through their cable package, then again if they want to stream them.Disney also wanted to allow “even less flexibility” in how its channels are packaged up into bundles, Charter claimed.The company says it previously expected to pay Disney $2.2bn for content in 2023 but that the entertainment giant’s latest demands “ignore the realities of today’s video business”.John Malone's main business Liberty Media is the top shareholder in Charter Communications - REUTERS/Rick WilkingOver the last five years, the linear video industry – television broadcast to a schedule – has lost almost 25 million customers, or roughly 25pc of the previous total.“It’s staggering,” Winfrey remarked.Much of this is the result of services such as Netflix that have eroded the structural advantages enjoyed by linear TV providers in the past, says Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis.In large swathes of the US, only one or two cable TV and broadband providers are available, resulting in higher prices compared to the UK and less choice.A common practice has always been to bundle popular channels – such as Disney’s ESPN – together with less popular ones.But people are much less willing to pay for channels they won’t watch in an era of “a la carte” streaming services that allow them to choose what they watch and when.“For cable TV providers like Charter, it is about as bad as it has ever been,” says Harrington.Meanwhile, many of the traditional content producers that have long licensed channels and programming to cable TV services are themselves haemorrhaging cash as they go toe-to-toe with Netflix by launching their own streaming platforms.Disney+ offers viewers everything from traditional animated classics such as Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast to Marvel movies, Star Wars spin-offs and TV series like Atlanta.Yet in its most recent quarter alone, Disney’s streaming operation lost $512m – taking total losses since its 2019 launch to $11bn.Iger, who was the company’s boss from 2005 to 2020 and then returned last year, has been brought back to hammer its finances back into shape. Squeezing a little more money out of partners such as Charter can’t hurt.Rival services include Paramount+, Warner Bros Discovery’s MAX and NBCUniversal’s Peacock face similar problems.Many want to attract subscribers to their new streaming platforms by offering a library of content they can’t access elsewhere, while at the same time selling their content to cable TV providers.In some cases, this has resulted in attempts to get around exclusivity deals with cable TV companies in ways that have raised eyebrows.For example, CNN’s news programming is supposed to be broadcast first on the cable and satellite TV services it has deals with.However, the channel has opted to make exclusive programmes to go on HBO’s MAX service to circumvent these restrictions.Christopher Winfrey, president of Charter Communications, said the company was forced to ‘draw a line in the sand’ in its dealings with DisneyFor Disney and its competitors, the fees from linear TV remain a vital source of income – bringing in far more than streaming does.The Disney-Charter dispute should be seen in this context, says Harrington.“Cable TV companies are under stress. But Charter probably thinks that Disney is under pressure too, and has calculated they can push it a bit further than if things were going well,” he explains.“They also feel that Disney’s channels are not worth as much as they were during the last negotiations, because a lot of content is now on Disney+.”Also hanging over the negotiations is Disney’s refusal to guarantee that cable TV customers who already pay for the ESPN channel will be able to access a planned on-demand ESPN service without paying extra.“They want to require customers to pay twice to get content apps with the linear video they have already paid for,” Charter’s Winfrey said.The row has parallels with a separate dispute playing out across the Atlantic, with customary British twists.Here, the likes of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 have been grappling with pay TV providers and television manufacturers for years over so-called “prominence”, or where their own apps and content gets placed in key software menus.For years the BBC has occupied the prestigious channels such as 101 and 102 on set top box services such as Sky and Freeview, but there are currently no hard rules on where TV makers such as Samsung should place them on smart TV menus.Instead, manufacturers have struck deals that give companies like Netflix top billing – and even include “Netflix” buttons on their television remotes.This new broadcasting land grab is happening amidst a once-in-a-generation shift in how people watch things.Audiences are flocking online, particularly young people. Public service broadcasters are desperate to build up the following of their own services, including BBC iPlayer, ITVX and Channel 4 On Demand, amid a panic that they may be left behind by Hollywood juggernauts.Ian Katz, chief content officer at Channel 4, recently defended a slump in the broadcaster’s so-called linear audience numbers, insisting that he was prioritising its streaming platform instead.“Frankly, any broadcaster who obsesses about linear ratings now risks going the way of Kodak or Blockbuster – great brands that fail to notice that the ground was shifting under their feet,” he said at last month’s Edinburgh TV festival.Back in the US, experts say Charter’s high-stakes punch-up with Disney could end up smashing the traditional pay TV model.Disney, for its part, says it has offered “the most favourable terms on rates, distribution, packaging, advertising and more” in talks so far.“Charter has refused to enter into a new agreement with us that reflects market-based terms,” the company claimed.“We are on the edge of a precipice,” Winfrey said last week. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”With fists raised, the only question now is who will blink first.“We are on the edge of a precipice,” Winfrey said last week. “We’re either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we’re moving on.”In a new statement on Thursday night, Disney accused Charter of “abandon[ing] their consumers” but said it “stands ready to resolve this dispute”.Disney accused Charter of rejecting “multiple offers to extend negotiations before taking Disney Entertainment’s networks down” and said it had “proposed creative ways to make its streaming services available to Charter’s Spectrum TV subscribers.”The media giant said: “The question for Charter is clear: Do you care about your subscribers and what they’re telling you they want – or not?”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 23.05, the question arises: Is the stock fairly valued? In this article, we will delve into a detailed valuation analysis of Phillips 66. We encourage you to read on for a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health and market position.Company IntroductionWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with PSX. Click here to check it out. PSX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PSXPhillips 66 is an independent refiner with 12 refineries that have a total crude throughput capacity of 1.9 million barrels per day. The company's midstream segment comprises extensive transportation and NGL processing assets. In 2023, the Rodeo, California, facility will cease operations and be converted to produce renewable diesel. The CPChem chemical joint venture operates facilities in the United States and the Middle East, primarily producing olefins and polyolefins.With a stock price of $122.81 and a market cap of $54.70 billion, it's crucial to compare these figures with the GF Value, an estimation of fair value. This comparison will provide a deeper understanding of the company's intrinsic value.Phillips 66 (PSX): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique measure that presents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It's calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should ideally trade at.Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) appears to be fairly valued according to the GuruFocus Value calculation. This calculation is based on the historical multiples at which the stock has traded, past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesGiven that Phillips 66 is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Phillips 66 (PSX): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's important to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can provide a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Phillips 66 has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.15, which ranks worse than 74.83% of 1021 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Phillips 66's financial strength as 7 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Phillips 66 (PSX): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is typically less risky. Phillips 66 has been profitable 9 times over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $154.70 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $23.05. Its operating margin is 6.28%, which ranks worse than 56.46% of 967 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, the profitability of Phillips 66 is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Phillips 66 is14.9%, which ranks better than 59.41% of 850 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 39.3%, which ranks better than 77.2% of 820 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCReturn on invested capital (ROIC) and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) are two ways to assess the profitability of a company. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. For the past 12 months, Phillips 66's ROIC is 13.74, and its WACC is 9.29.Phillips 66 (PSX): A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market ValueConclusionIn conclusion, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) shows every sign of being fairly valued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks better than 77.2% of 820 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

(NYSE:TJX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies Is TJX Companies Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.52bUS$3.76bUS$4.57bUS$4.59bUS$5.68bUS$6.21bUS$6.66bUS$7.04bUS$7.37bUS$7.65bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 9.38%Est @ 7.21%Est @ 5.69%Est @ 4.63%Est @ 3.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$3.3kUS$3.3kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$4.0kUS$4.1kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$38bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.7b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.2%) = US$153bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$153b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$76bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$114b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$91.5, the company appears about fair value at a 7.9% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TJX Companies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.021. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for TJX CompaniesStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Specialty Retail market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Among these, Amgen’s AMGN impending acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP remains in the spotlight.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:COVID Vaccine Updates by Moderna:  Moderna MRNA announced encouraging data on its updated COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.815. The updated vaccine generated an 8.7-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the BA.2.86 variant, also known as Pirola. This variant is a highly mutated strain of COVID-19 with more than 30 mutations compared to prior Omicron strains and is being vigilantly monitored by public health authorities. The Centers for Disease Control has indicated that the highly mutated BA.2.86 variant may be more capable of causing infection in people who previously had COVID-19 or were vaccinated with prior vaccines. The vaccine also proved effective against the EG.5 and FL.1.5.1 variants.A regulatory filing is currently under the agency’s review seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.815. A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. The vaccine is also currently under review in Europe. Moderna earlier stated that it built an ample supply for mRNA-1273.815 and is ready to ship the doses in the upcoming fall vaccination season, provided the FDA authorizes the vaccine.Moderna currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As a result of the consent order agreement, Amgen and Horizon expect that the parties will jointly file stipulated proposed orders to dismiss the preliminary injunction motion and dissolve the temporary restraining order in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and the firms will quickly seek the final approvals required under Irish law to close the acquisition. Shares of both companies were up on the news.Story continuesAmgen will not be bundling any of its products with Horizon Therapeutics’ two essential products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout). Both companies expect to close the acquisition in early fourth-quarter 2023.Alnylam’s Study Data: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ALNY announced positive results from the phase II KARDIA-1 study on zilebesiran for the treatment of hypertension in patients at high cardiovascular risk. The candidate is an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting liver-expressed angiotensinogen. Zilebesiran met the primary endpoint, demonstrating greater than 15 mmHg reduction of systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at three months of treatment compared to placebo at both 300 mg and 600 mg doses. Alnylam also reported meeting key secondary endpoints in the study, including a significant change in 24-hour mean SBP as measured by ABPM at month six, as well as a significant change in office SBP at month three and month six for all zilebesiran arms compared to placebo.Alnylam further stated that the candidate demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile.  Alnylam is developing zilebesiran in partnership with Roche. Alnylam also reported that the phase II KARDIA-2 study completed enrollment in June 2023, expecting top-line results in early 2024.Biohaven’s Study Update: Biohaven BHVN announced preliminary analyses and positive biomarker data from its exploratory phase I electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarker study. The phase I EEG study was designed to evaluate qualitative changes from baseline in EEG spectral power after administration of single doses of BHV-7000 (10, 25, or 50 mg) to healthy volunteers. Biohaven is developing BHV-7000 for the treatment of epilepsy and mood disorders. The analysis confirms central nervous system activity of BHV-7000 at projected therapeutic concentrations, dose-dependent and time-dependent changes in EEG spectral power. It is consistent with EEG effects observed with other antiseizure medications approved for treating epilepsy.BHV-7000 is well tolerated in phase I single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose studies to date. Biohaven has also completed the development of an extended-release formulation of BHV-7000 to allow once-daily dosing to be studied in future clinical programs.

106,cd9a1924-f2ea-3186-83ba-a13c38085ea9,GD,2023-09-09,Camtek and Dollar General have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/camtek-dollar-general-highlighted-zacks-115200392.html,1694173920,STORY,"['DG', 'GD', 'CAMT', 'LMT']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 8, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Camtek CAMT as the Bull of the Day and Dollar General DG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on RTX Corp. (RTX), Lockheed Martin LMT and General Dynamics GD.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Technical pressures in the market have brought out the sellers. The narrative of higher for longer has the market worried. A second wave of inflation has investors worried. It's partially to blame for the recent selling. I welcome opportunities like this because it puts great stocks on sale. One way to find these stocks is by leaning on the time-tested strength of our Zacks Rank. Stocks in the good graces of our Zacks Rank have the best earnings trends.One such stock is today's Bull of the Day Camtek. Camtek Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures, and sells inspection and metrology equipment for the advanced interconnect packaging, memory, complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensors, micro-electro mechanical systems, radio frequency, and other segments of the semiconductor industry.The stock is in the Electronics – Measuring Instruments industry which ranks in the Top 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The reason for the favorable rank is that over the last sixty days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $1.70 to $1.86 while next year's number is up from $1.90 to $2.24.A quick look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart reveals just how bullish analysts have been. Several earnings beats in a row have created a ton of momentum. You can also see the year-over-year jump in growth numbers after earnings dipped into the start of this year. Since then, estimates have gone in a singular direction...up.Story continuesBear of the Day:With the market unwinding, there are plenty of stocks that are coming under pressure. Selling is hitting many industries. There are some stocks out there which are more vulnerable than others. The most vulnerable stocks are those with the weakest earnings trends. One way to uncover this weakness is by checking out our Zacks Rank. Stocks which are lower Zacks Ranks have the weakest trends.One such stock is today's Bear of the Day, Dollar General. Dollar General Corporation, a discount retailer, provides various merchandise products in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern United States. It offers consumable products, including paper and cleaning products, such as paper towels, bath tissues, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, disinfectants, and laundry products; packaged food comprising cereals, pasta, canned soups, fruits and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar, and flour; and perishables that include milk, eggs, bread, refrigerated and frozen food, beer, and wine.Dollar General is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank is several analysts have cut their estimates. Over the last week, 13 analysts have cut their estimates for the current year while 12 have done so for next year. The bearish activity has dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $10.08 to $8.82 while next year's is off from $10.97 to $9.64. The most recent earnings report coming in 36 cents shy of expectations is a big reason why.The Retail – Discount Stores industry ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:U.S. Pledges More Security Aid to Ukraine: 3 Stocks to BenefitThe U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) recently announced a new security package worth $175 million, offered by the Biden administration for Ukraine. Prior to this, in August 2023, the United States offered a $250 million aid to Ukraine, for supplying air defense and artillery munitions, mine-clearing equipment and medical vehicles.The latest commitment made by President Biden takes the total security assistance provided by America to Ukraine to $43.7 billion since February 2022, following Russia's Ukrainian invasion.  The new security package has currently put the spotlight on U.S. defense majors likeRTX Corp., Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, which are expected to gain in the near term.Details of the PackageThe latest aid package marks the 46th tranche of equipment to be provided from DoD inventories for Ukraine, since August 2021.

This aid also includes delivering Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles, Javelin systems, more than 3 million rounds of small arms ammunition and some more tactical equipment.Defense Stocks to GainConsidering the aforementioned discussion, it is quite obvious that U.S. defense contractors, particularly those manufacturing defense products pledged by America to Ukraine as part of the latest aid package, will gain substantially in the coming days.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, FirstEnergy has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while NextEra Energy has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that FE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.FE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.04, while NEE has a forward P/E of 21.30. We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2.18. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. NEE currently has a PEG ratio of 2.54.Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P/B ratio of 1.85. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NEE has a P/B of 2.50.These metrics, and several others, help FE earn a Value grade of B, while NEE has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesFE sticks out from NEE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that FE is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about NextEra Energy (NEE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 10 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.9% and 7.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying NextEra, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NEE a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $3.11.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Whether you are a merchant looking for cost-efficiencies, a biller modernizing how your customers share banking data or a brokerage firm wanting guaranteed settlement in order to offer instant use of funds during enrolment, Bankify's account linking experience and settlement guarantee are powerful tools that help an organization's top and bottom lines.”Alexandre Gontheir, the founder and CEO of Trustly, said, “The collaboration between Trustly and BNY Mellon emerged through our mutual focus on advancing the payment industry and establishing a new, alternative, open banking-based standard for consumer and business payments. We believe that consumers have the right to a financially responsible payment method and that merchants have the right to unique open banking-enabled data insights.”Bankify has been launched at a time when there are still many questions about the use of open banking.Open banking, which has been prevalent elsewhere, is slowly becoming popular in the United States. Open banking is a system that uses open application programming interfaces that allow third-party developers to build applications and services around the financial institution and let consumers dictate what data can be shared with third parties and apps.With the help of open banking, BNY Mellon will be able to bring down transaction costs.BNY Mellon has continuously been undertaking several growth initiatives, like launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts. In 2021, the company, through its subsidiary, acquired Optimal Asset Management.BNY Mellon has been trying to gain a foothold in foreign markets. Given the huge growth potential of overseas securities markets and a rise in complex new securities, the long-term growth prospects of the industry are encouraging. The company’s international revenues are expected to continue improving as demand for personalized services rises across the globe.Over the past three months, shares of BNY Mellon have gained 0.9% against the industry’s decline of 1.5%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

114,605315a4-e64d-3d38-bd1f-6a3b5cd57dd7,QCOM,2023-09-09,"U.S. economy, oil inflation, China vs. Apple: Top 3 takeaways of the week",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/resilient-us-economy-oils-inflation-140212088.html,1694181732,VIDEO,"['NVDA', 'INTC', 'TSM', 'TSMWF', 'AAPL', 'BZ=F', 'QCOM', 'AMD']","[The U.S. economy is showing signs of resiliency as jobless claims hit their lowest levels since February and consumers have shown they are willing to spend more money on travel and experiences in the post-COVID era.Yahoo Finance Live examines the economic challenges consumers are bracing for amid the resumption of student loan payments, Saudi Arabia and Russia’s extensive oil production cuts, and Apple’s stock sell-off inspired by the Chinese government’s iPhone ban.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: But top takeaways from this week, Brad and I have three of them. And we start with the US economy being resilient out of this week, showing the services sector in the US gained strength in August, jobless claims unexpectedly fell the prior week. That indicates a tighter than anticipated job market that is continuing here.And what's interesting is, yes, we had two reads on the services economy. The one from ISM did show surprising strength. The one from S&amp;P which is one could argue a more comprehensive look includes more sizes of companies, was not as strong. Nonetheless, broadly here, when you look at the economic data we've been getting over the past several months, it has indeed been surprising to the upside. And that's really been the story for much of the year as well but we just kind of keep getting little reminders of it.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and as we think about the shift in spending that's taking place here from goods to services for so many consumers out there and thinking about this kind of consumer resiliency that we've heard about over the course of this earnings season from a myriad of different companies, how does that showing up? Well, one area that I would look at that's not necessarily the economic data but is a piece of broader data that we can string together is how much people are spending on the experiences economy and traveling particularly here.And I was looking at some TSA passenger throughput numbers, really looking through the summer months here. So essentially, from Memorial Day weekend all the way through Labor Day weekend, now that we have the data and can layer that year over year, we are running at 102% of pre-pandemic levels on the TSA checkpoint travel numbers as of right now. So running that this morning, and so the travel spending continuing to remain strong at this point.Story continuesBut this resiliency is going to come with some tests. We should note, too. The student loans and that coming once again back on the table for repayment, that's going to be a test, October 1 there is when that recommences. And then additionally, you've seen excess savings start to be depleted a little bit more among households. So that shift in how households are spending, that certainly of note here in some of the tests for that consumer resiliency that we're going to be watching closely for.JULIE HYMAN: It's also important just quickly how all of this is playing through in asset classes, right? Because we have this US economic strength that has meant a stronger dollar, which we've been talking a lot about this week as well. And the implications for US companies and for international economies and currencies. So the dollar strength part of the story.And what also we have been seeing in terms of yields in the treasury market is also obviously part of the story. What are the implications for the Federal Reserve? And whether it's going to have to, if not keep raising rates, keep them higher for longer as the conversation keeps going. We've got 10-year yields that are sort of hovering near their highest that they have been in more than a year. So that's something we continue to watch as well.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, absolutely. One other thing that we're watching here, the second big thing that Julie and I have our eye on or learned from this week, oil. Maybe the deflation spoiler. On Tuesday Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend their oil production cuts through the year's end. Both Brent and West Texas crude rose to their highest levels since November, fueling fears that elevated oil prices could stop moderating inflation here.And particularly, we had a soundbite or at least one of the comments on this from Mark Zandi, chief economist over at Moody's, who had said that $90 a barrel oil for any length of time would be problematic. Oil higher for longer in this instance essentially would be a problem for the Fed's fight against inflation.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and most of the oil analysts that we've spoken to have also said they don't expect it to, if it does fall, it's not going to fall by much. It seems to kind of be the consensus view here. We even have some estimates out from Goldman Sachs for it to be going significantly higher as well.Now, we know that the Fed doesn't specifically watch energy prices on their own because they do tend to be volatile but the question is the feed through to other stuff. There are also implications for gasoline prices at the pump, which we're showing here now, and what that's going to mean politically, which is sort of a down the line story but something that our Rick Newman has been talking about and has been watching very closely.And then sort of on a related note when we talk about politics, we could talk about geopolitics. And the third takeaway from the week is the latest victim of the trade war and tensions between the US and China taking a bite out of Apple. Shares of the tech giant falling this week on reports that China's iPhone ban is broadening across government, not just government agencies but government-sponsored enterprises.China, one of the tech giant's biggest markets, it accounts for just under 19% of overall revenue. And Beijing has already limited government officials from using iPhones again reportedly. This new report would significantly broaden that ban signal a bigger crackdown. And for a company that has traditionally had more of a favorable relationship with the Chinese government, this perhaps signals a new front or a new move in the tensions between the two countries sort of ensnaring Apple within it as we talked about big drop in those shares. But again, it raises these bigger questions about geopolitical maneuvering on the part of different nations.BRAD SMITH: And where companies have found themselves in the throes of that, I mean, when we think back to in kind of the chronological order that all of this has taken place within and ranging over administrations at this point, because China has a far further out view of how they want to play this. And I think for right now, the companies that have found themselves in the midst of this, sure, it's been TikTok and ByteDance.But then additionally, you've also found some of the chip companies finding themselves squarely within the throes of a tit for tat on intellectual property and where chips can be purchased or where they can be sold to. And now, even more so, it's coming into the consumer technology companies and Apple finding themselves in the throes of that this week, and that coming to light especially with the ban on government officials being able to use their devices.Now, the next question is-- and investors would be smart to think about-- where else might this overflow into? Well, there's an interesting call out this morning and particularly looking at other auto players within China that could be maintaining or at least gaining some more favorability here that could impact companies like Tesla, that could impact companies like Ford, who are all trying to release some of the most popular US models that they've had on the mass market scale into China as well, and produce there, and have better favoritism there among consumers on price at least. And so in that battling for price, that's one area that investors would be smart or apt to just think about where else this could permeate out into as well.]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on QUALCOMM is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$11b ÷ (US$49b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, QUALCOMM has an ROCE of 28%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 12% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for QUALCOMM compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for QUALCOMM.What Can We Tell From QUALCOMM's ROCE Trend?QUALCOMM is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 152% over the last five years. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From QUALCOMM's ROCEIn summary, we're delighted to see that QUALCOMM has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 62% return over the last five years.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on RTX Corp. (RTX), Lockheed Martin LMT and General Dynamics GD.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Technical pressures in the market have brought out the sellers. The narrative of higher for longer has the market worried. A second wave of inflation has investors worried. It's partially to blame for the recent selling. I welcome opportunities like this because it puts great stocks on sale. One way to find these stocks is by leaning on the time-tested strength of our Zacks Rank. Stocks in the good graces of our Zacks Rank have the best earnings trends.One such stock is today's Bull of the Day Camtek. Camtek Ltd., together with its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures, and sells inspection and metrology equipment for the advanced interconnect packaging, memory, complementary metal oxide semiconductor image sensors, micro-electro mechanical systems, radio frequency, and other segments of the semiconductor industry.The stock is in the Electronics – Measuring Instruments industry which ranks in the Top 11% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The reason for the favorable rank is that over the last sixty days, five analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year and next year. The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $1.70 to $1.86 while next year's number is up from $1.90 to $2.24.A quick look at the Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart reveals just how bullish analysts have been. Several earnings beats in a row have created a ton of momentum. You can also see the year-over-year jump in growth numbers after earnings dipped into the start of this year. Since then, estimates have gone in a singular direction...up.Story continuesBear of the Day:With the market unwinding, there are plenty of stocks that are coming under pressure. Selling is hitting many industries. There are some stocks out there which are more vulnerable than others. The most vulnerable stocks are those with the weakest earnings trends. One way to uncover this weakness is by checking out our Zacks Rank. Stocks which are lower Zacks Ranks have the weakest trends.One such stock is today's Bear of the Day, Dollar General. Dollar General Corporation, a discount retailer, provides various merchandise products in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern United States. It offers consumable products, including paper and cleaning products, such as paper towels, bath tissues, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, disinfectants, and laundry products; packaged food comprising cereals, pasta, canned soups, fruits and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar, and flour; and perishables that include milk, eggs, bread, refrigerated and frozen food, beer, and wine.Dollar General is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The reason for the unfavorable rank is several analysts have cut their estimates. Over the last week, 13 analysts have cut their estimates for the current year while 12 have done so for next year. The bearish activity has dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from $10.08 to $8.82 while next year's is off from $10.97 to $9.64. The most recent earnings report coming in 36 cents shy of expectations is a big reason why.The Retail – Discount Stores industry ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank.Additional content:U.S. Pledges More Security Aid to Ukraine: 3 Stocks to BenefitThe U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) recently announced a new security package worth $175 million, offered by the Biden administration for Ukraine.

However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing it to cut spending substantially.The company’s high oil price sensitivity is a concern too.

It now expects revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of 2023.Nevertheless, stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Apple, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+ and TikTok is a headwind.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 85% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Medtronic. See our latest analysis for Medtronic ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medtronic?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Medtronic does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Medtronic, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Medtronic. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 4.5% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 25 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MedtronicThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Medtronic plc. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$49m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Medtronic. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Medtronic  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

After all, founded in 1996, the company made its name hauling trash and still makes 5 million collections a day. But Vander Ark, CEO since 2021 and a 13-year veteran of Republic Services, has been working to modernize its business model to go after the higher-growth, higher-profit recycling market.""I've seen us go from a garbage company to a waste company to a waste and recycling company to now an environmental services and sustainability company,"" says Vander Ark.Last year, Republic managed 8 million tons of recyclable items, and extracted 2.4 million tons of materials that can have a second life. This strategy has boosted its stock in the last two years and given the company a market cap of $45 billion. What's more, under Vander Ark, Republic has gone after the fast-growing environmental services and consulting business, making a number of acquisitions. Vander Ark's moves raised revenue 20% last year to almost $14 billion.The CEO says the way for Republic to thrive in this hyper-politicized environment around climate change is to simply be pragmatic about the focus on cost savings and revenue potential as Americans recycle more. For instance, Republic now has a fast-growing business recovering plastic consumer packaging for circularity, a term that refers to components being constantly re-used. It takes thrown away plastics and recycles them to produce high-quality plastic used by consumer packaged goods companies. ""We think about circularity and de-carbonization as two fundamental mega-trends,"" says Vander Ark.This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: How do we in the U.S. become a less wasteful society? And if we manage to do that, is that bad for business?It would not hurt business. In fact it helps. We're already seeing that in terms of shrinking solid waste on a per capita basis. Typically a market grows with population, but solid waste is shrinking because we're diverting more and recycling is growing faster to make up the difference. Our aspiration is to accelerate that trend. So we look at every ton that goes into a landfill and challenge ourselves and ask, ""How could we take that out and create value with it?"" I pay for something to go to a landfill. But if I can recycle it, I get value for it on the other end.Story continuesWhen you look at how far along many European countries are in recycling in contrast to how much Americans throw out as trash, it's tempting to see Americans as lazy. Can recycling really become part of our culture?We're certainly behind the Europeans. They're a very source-separated environment and things are very clearly separated for plastic, aluminum, glass and paper. That's how the U.S. was originally and recycling rates didn't really move for a period of time. When it did take off is when we moved to single stream, which is to put everything in one big container, which made it easier for people to recycle. But that has complications. You have some people who don't care and they're still putting garbage in and contaminating that load. And then you have at the other end, the wishful recycler who wants that greasy pizza box to be recycled so badly, but it can't be.It seems like a lot of packaging is wasteful and impedes recycling. What can be done?Take plastic packaging. Not all plastics are recyclable. So take a clamshell that is used for your take-out chicken rotisserie. It was made with post-consumer recycled content (material made from the items that consumers recycle every day such as aluminum, cardboard boxes, paper, and plastic bottles). But that shell itself is not going to be recycled, it's going to the landfill. So part of the opportunity is to design for recyclability upfront.What do you make of the current pushback against ESG (environmental, social, and governance) standards for publicly traded companies? Could this hurt your business, or does this ESG emphasis march forward?""ESG"" needs to be unpacked. It's like a pig, a chicken and duck that get lumped together. All different, but all worthy topics. The ""E"" part of this is here to stay. We think about circularity and de-carbonization as two fundamental mega-trends that whatever the political sentiment, companies are investing billions of dollars in. There's a global consensus there and we see those as tailwinds for our business.Another CEO recently told me that you can get consumers on board with green initiatives more easily if one doesn't mention climate change, and by emphasizing reducing waste and saving money. Do you agree?We're not running away from climate change. We get that the world is heating up and humans are a factor in that and we don't hide from that. I would say this: if something's going to be environmentally sustainable, it's got to be economically sustainable. So we don't do things as science projects or for charity. It's our business and we're going to make money and grow.You have a goal that by 2030, half of your new garbage and recycling trucks will be electric vehicles. That's ambitious but what stops you from going even faster?Just like a passenger car, if you retrofit a diesel truck, you add too much weight with the batteries and so it becomes economically inefficient. But when you design it from scratch, you take enough weight out so it can run a full 10.5-hour day and 125 miles without having to stop, so you don't lose productivity.Do you ever get offended by someone calling Republic Services a garbage company despite all the push you've made into recycling and environmental services?We're not offended by that because people get too easily offended. That's what we called ourselves a decade ago and I've seen us go from a garbage company to a waste company to a waste and recycling company to now an environmental services and sustainability company. And as that's evolved, so has our mindset. We still have landfills and they are going to be with us for a long time, so we don't run from that. But we're way bigger and way more than that now.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

132,e578310c-25e8-33d6-9797-f0bb60d6712f,MRK,2023-09-09,"Why It Might Not Make Sense To Buy Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-might-not-sense-buy-121645483.html,1694261805,STORY,['MRK'],"[Readers hoping to buy Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Merck's shares on or after the 14th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 6th of October.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.73 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.92 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Merck has a trailing yield of 2.7% on the current share price of $109.05. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Merck Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Merck paid out a disturbingly high 232% of its profit as dividends last year, which makes us concerned there's something we don't fully understand in the business. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It paid out more than half (67%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.It's good to see that while Merck's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. If executives were to continue paying more in dividends than the company reported in profits, we'd view this as a warning sign. Extraordinarily few companies are capable of persistently paying a dividend that is greater than their profits.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Merck earnings per share are up 6.9% per annum over the last five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Merck has delivered 5.4% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Merck for the upcoming dividend? While earnings per share have been growing slowly, Merck is paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of its earnings. However it did pay out a lower percentage of its cashflow. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective, and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.So if you're still interested in Merck despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Merck and you should be aware of these before buying any shares.A common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $85 per barrel. The recent decision of Saudi Arabia and Russia to voluntarily extend oil production cuts until the end of the year, despite the commodity trading in bullish territory, is primarily aiding the crude rally.Thus, it’s pretty apparent that the business model of most energy players, by nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to keep an eye on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc WMB.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices than oil and gas producers. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term.

The company has dozens of open positions on its Vietnam web page.Story continuesChip designing firm Marvell has said it plans to build a ""world-class"" centre in Vietnam.U.S. officials have repeatedly said that assembling and designing were the segments of the chipmaking industry where Vietnam was likely to grow faster, although a shortage of engineers could slow the industry take-off.Vietnam has also ambitions to build its own chipmaking factories, or fabs. GlobalFoundries is specialised in making integrated circuits on wafers for smartphones, cars and other applications.Vietnam is a major exporter of smartphones and electronics.An executive at a major U.S. chips firm said the Vietnamese government had been holding meetings with most major chips companies in the country, including Intel, Samsung and Qualcomm, to ask for advice on setting up the country's first fab.U.S. officials have also said an upgrade of formal ties with Vietnam could help collaboration on artificial intelligence (AI), a sector in which Google is a major global player.Vingroup, Vietnam's largest conglomerate and the parent of Nasdaq-listed electric car maker VinFast, has a unit focussed on AI.Boeing may announce a deal involving the sale of 50 of its 737 MAX jets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Hours earlier, CFM International Inc., the joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA that makes the engines for many older-generation Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft, said parts with fraudulent documentation had been put on 68 of its power plants.The widening scandal has shaken an industry where safety is the guiding principle, with exacting standards for aircraft manufacturing and maintenance that demands each component be verified. Regulators, airlines and other industry players have been scouring their records to hunt down the suspect components sold by AOG, the obscure supplier at the center of the crisis.CFM, the world’s largest jet-engine manufacturer, filed a lawsuit in the UK against AOG Technics. The suit seeks an injunction to force AOG to provide more information to aid the aviation industry’s search for suspect components. It also seeks to recover any parts in AOG’s possession purported to be from CFM or GE.In response to questions from Bloomberg News, which first reported on the AOG case, Southwest said that two low-pressure turbine blades were the components it pulled from one of its engines. The carrier took “precautionary and immediate measures” to remove them based on the fact they were supplied by AOG.Story continuesThe parts were found in an engine on a Boeing 737 NG, an older version of Boeing’s most popular model. CFM supplies engines to both the Airbus and the Boeing planes. In the last decade, both models have undergone a technical upgrade with new engines — the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max — that use different powerplants not affected by the AOG case.Still, the CFM56 model is the most widely used jet engine in service today. It has been used on single-aisle planes for decades, with more than 33,000 engines delivered to more than 600 operators worldwide. The single-aisle Airbus and Boeing jets are used by millions of passengers each day and by most airlines, mainly on short-haul flights.To date, CFM and GE Aerospace have found 78 documents they say are falsified and which cover 52 CFM56 engine part numbers, along with two faked records for CF6 components. AOG has no direct affiliation with CFM or its partners.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency earlier this week determined that the components backed by forged documentation included turbine blades, a critical component of an aircraft’s propulsion system.Airbus has said it’s aware of reports surrounding AOG, while Boeing has deferred to regulators on the topic.Representatives for AOG could not be reached for immediate comment. Based on the UK’s Companies House records, AOG was established in 2015. The supplier of parts to third-party engine repair shops was created by Jose Zamora Yrala, who hasn’t responded to emails or phone calls seeking comment.“Safety is our first priority, and we are taking aggressive legal action against AOG Technics to accelerate the industry’s ability to identify parts sold by this third-party with falsified documentation,” a CFM spokesman said in a statement.No incidents linked to the suspect parts have been identified, CFM and GE have said. EASA said last week that while the parts of questionable origin are “a matter for concern, to date there have been no reports of problems resulting from the suspect unapproved parts.”Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and engine makers go to great lengths inspecting their equipment to identify faults or fatigue, a practice that has contributed to ever-lower incidents in an industry priding itself as being among the safest modes of transport. When unforeseen faults to crop up — even those that are not deemed a safety issue — they can lead to lengthy and costly repairs.--With assistance from Albertina Torsoli.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutJames Dolan’s $2.3 Billion Sphere Is Raising Eyebrows—in a Good WayInvestors Stand by Israel’s Tech Startups, for NowGoodbye, California.

The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 2/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 4/105. Momentum rank: 8/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc the GF Score of 62 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Snapshot of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc's BusinessSpirit AeroSystems designs and manufactures aerostructures, particularly fuselages, for commercial and military aircraft. The company was spun out of Boeing in 2005, and the firm is the largest independent supplier of aerostructures. Boeing and Airbus are the firms and their primary customers, Boeing composes roughly 80% of annual revenue and Airbus composes roughly 15% of revenue. The company is highly exposed to Boeing's 737 program, which generally accounts for about half of the company's revenue.Story continuesUnraveling the Future of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsFinancial Strength BreakdownSpirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 0, which positions it worse than 0% of 189 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 1.07, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.13 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -13.8 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 85.38% of 260 companies in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market.Lastly, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Future of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance.

Shares have lost about 14.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Illumina due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Illumina Q2 Earnings Top Estimates, Margins DipIllumina Inc. reported adjusted earnings per share of 32 cents in the second quarter of 2023, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents by a remarkable margin. However, the bottom line declined 43.9% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 57 cents.The adjustments exclude the impact of GRAIL pre-acquisition net operating losses on GILTI, the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits and incremental non-GAAP tax expenses, among others. Including one-time items, the company’s GAAP loss per share was $1.48 compared with the year-ago quarter’s loss of $3.40.RevenuesIn the quarter under review, Illumina’s revenues were $1.18 billion, up 1.1% year over year (up 3% at CER). The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%.Segment DetailsPost the acquisition of GRAIL on Aug 18, 2021, Illumina has two reportable segments — Core Illumina and GRAIL.Core Illumina revenues were flat year over year (up 2% at the constant exchange rate or CER) to $1.16 billion. Core Illumina Sequencing Consumable revenues totaled $739 million in the reported quarter, down 1% year over year. Our model projected Core Illumina revenues of $1.18 billion for Q2.Sequencing Instrument revenues for Core Illumina of $193 million grew 2% year over year. The increase was partially led by strength in NovaSeq X shipments. Core Illumina sequencing service and other revenues were $134 million (up 7% year over year). Higher instrument service contract revenues drove the upside on a growing installed base.Story continuesGRAIL contributed $22 million to revenues during the reported quarter compared with $12 million in the year-ago period. Our model projected GRAIL revenues of $26.5 million for the second quarter.MarginsThe adjusted gross margin (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) was 66.3% in the reported quarter, highlighting a contraction of 312 basis points (bps) year over year. The decline is attributed to lower fixed-cost leverage on reduced manufacturing volumes and lower instrument margins due to the NovaSeq X launch, as expected for a new platform introduction.R&amp;D expenses increased 9.5% year over year to $358 million, whereas SG&amp;A expenses rose 9.8% to $450 million. These pulled up adjusted operating costs by 9.6% to $808 million.The adjusted operating loss in the quarter was $28 million against the prior-year quarter’s adjusted operating income of $70 million.Financial UpdateIllumina exited the second quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments of $1.56 billion compared with $1.55 billion at the end of first-quarter 2023. The company did not repurchase any common stock in the quarter.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of the second quarter of 2023 was $115 million compared with $297 million a year ago.2023 GuidanceIllumina updated its 2023 outlook.The company expects fiscal 2023 consolidated revenue growth to be 1% (the earlier guidance was -10% year over year). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.92 billion.The adjusted earnings per share for 2023 is expected in the range of 70 cents-90 cents (the previous guidance was $1.25-$1.50).

146,2c752795-27dd-3c9f-bbb1-8cc1e3e35d2d,SO,2023-09-09,Is The Southern Company's (NYSE:SO) 8.6% ROE Strong Compared To Its Industry?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-companys-nyse-8-6-110032750.html,1694257232,STORY,['SO'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Southern How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southern is:8.6% = US$3.0b ÷ US$35b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.09.Does Southern Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Southern has a similar ROE to the average in the Electric Utilities industry classification (8.3%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If a company takes on too much debt, it is at higher risk of defaulting on interest payments.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for Southern.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesSouthern's Debt And Its 8.6% ROESouthern does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.76. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course Southern may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Cigna Group, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.078 = US$8.0b ÷ (US$150b - US$47b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, Cigna Group has an ROCE of 7.8%. On its own, that's a low figure but it's around the 9.5% average generated by the Healthcare industry. Check out our latest analysis for Cigna Group roceIn the above chart we have measured Cigna Group's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Cigna Group doesn't inspire confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 10%, but since then they've fallen to 7.8%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Cigna Group's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 51% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.On a separate note, we've found   3 warning signs for Cigna Group   you'll probably want to know about.While Cigna Group may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

I am joined today Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. Given the breadth of information that will be covered on the call and our divestiture announcement earlier this morning, we will extend our Q&amp;A session if needed to ensure that we can cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Rodney.Story continuesWilliam Rodney McMullenThank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline the framework for our discussion this morning given that we have several important topics to cover. I will begin by covering the consumer environment and how the strength of our value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then Gary will cover our financial results and highlights as well as provide an update on our nationwide opioid settlement framework. Finally, I will conclude with some brief comments on the divestiture plan press release we issued earlier this morning. We are excited about sharing our plans for this important milestone, and we look forward to taking your questions during the Q&amp;A segment of today's call. Now turning to our second quarter. Kroger continues to effectively navigate a challenged environment and delivered another quarter of consistent results. As economic uncertainty persists, the strength of our model is enabling us to deliver value for our customers, continue to invest in our associates and deliver consistent shareholder return. Revenue remains top of mind for many of our customers as they are balancing several factors that are impacting their food at home spending. The effect of sustained inflation, reduced government benefits including SNAP and higher interest rates have pressured customer spending, especially for those on a tight budget. To support our customers, we are delivering increased value through our robust Our Brands portfolio, personalized digital offers, fuel rewards and loyalty discounts, including weekly specials and yellow tag promotions. Economic instability continues to impact customer segments differently. We are seeing this in their shopping behaviors. Higher income households continue to engage more deeply with us, enjoying our customer experience with zero compromise on convenience, quality and value. These customers are especially valuable to our mix as they purchase bigger pack sizes, shop more Fresh categories and trade up to more premium Our Brands products. On the other hand, budget-conscious households are facing external spending pressures. These customers are buying smaller pack sizes and, at times, prioritizing the lowest shelf price. These customers are building smaller baskets and switching to lower-priced items to stretch their budgets. They are also exhibiting spending patterns that ebb and flow with payroll periods and SNAP benefit distributions. We expect these broader economic headwinds to continue pressuring customer spending in the second half of the year. While the environment is difficult we are never satisfied with sales and we are focused on driving more units in the back half of the year. Our teams are sharpening store execution, identifying basket add-ons and adapting to customers' evolving needs. We saw an improvement in our budget-conscious household trends since last quarter as we expanded our assortment of everyday staples at lower price points. And as an example, we introduced new in-store displays where every item is below $3. Additionally, we continue to improve price position relative to key competitors, demonstrating our long-term commitment to provide customers with exceptional value. We are creating more engagement with customers through personalization, offering more targeted and effective promotions and our seamless ecosystem is resonating with customer needs. And it allows us to drive increased loyalty. And customers are rewarding us for this work. The second quarter represented our ninth consecutive quarter of total household growth. And now I'll provide more detail on how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. We are reimagining our offerings throughout our portfolio of Our Brands. With more than 13,000 products available, customers can enjoy a wide range of high-quality alternatives to fit each customer's budget. Additionally, we are improving the profitability of Our Brands. Through our brand architect work, we are ensuring each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. Last year's introduction of our opening price point brand, Smart Way, provides a great option for those prioritizing the lowest price at the shelf, and it is resonating with our customers. Turning to Seamless, strong growth in our pickup and delivery businesses led to another excellent quarter in digital. This growth was underscored by a rise in both households and traffic. Our digital team's relentless pursuit of improving the customers' experience is driving our success. We scaled our hands-free technology across the company to improve speed and expanded pickup options with automated pods and lockers, improving productivity and providing customers with more flexibility. Our in-store associates are also playing a critical role in our success. This quarter, they reduced wait time, lowered cost to serve and improved fill rates. Pickup has had a positive incremental contribution for some time. In multiple divisions now, our pickup business today is now profitable on a fully loaded basis. And by continuing to scale our operations, we have a clear path to sustainable profitability and pickup. Next, on personalization. Personalization enables us to meet our customers' unique needs and deliver value beyond the product shelf price. Our best-in-class data science work powered by our loyalty data is driving strong digital engagement. So far this year, customers have clipped more than 2 billion digital offers. To me, that's just an amazing number when you think about 2 billion. We've also increased our digitally engaged households by 1.2 million compared to last year. This growth is important to our model as digitally engaged households are more loyal, spend nearly 3x more with us and help grow our alternative profit businesses like Kroger Precision Marketing. Now I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model continued to support earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Alternative profits had an impressive second quarter led by strong growth in our retail media business, Kroger Precision Marketing. Our seamless ecosystem continues to drive and track data and traffic which benefits this business. KPM applies these insights in its data science to build custom audiences and precisely measure return on ad spend delivering significant value to clients. This quarter, KPM announced a new in-house advertising platform, which allows greater flexibility to serve clients and improve outcomes for brands. Kroger Health is another important component of our business that allows us to help customers live better lives and strengthen our model. The terminated agreement with ESI has freed up some capacity in our pharmacies, and our Kroger Health teams are doing a great job of utilizing that capacity. Our pharmacists are dedicating more time to patient care and delivering better patient experiences. We are also simplifying work for our teams and lowering costs by expanding our use of automation. We are improving patient communications through modernized tools, which is driving better patient adherence to care plans and supporting growth. We are encouraged by the momentum in our health and wellness business and believe this is an opportunity for further profitable growth over the next several years. Our amazing associates are providing customers a full fresh and friendly experience every day. We remain committed to supporting our associates through investment in wages. And over the last 5 years, we've raised wages by 30%. We are also committed to supporting our associates development. I often say that our focus is to make Kroger a place where associates can come for a job and discover a career. Kroger has made significant investments to support this culture, and our teams have done a tremendous job creating training programs to help develop our future leaders. Our work was recently recognized with 8 awards from the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm. We are so proud of the work you are doing to help make Kroger an employer of choice. I'm inspired every day to see how our associates bring our purpose to feed the human spirit. Our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan is a vital part of how we live our purpose in the communities we serve. Upon launching the plan in 2017, Kroger committed to donate 3 billion meals by 2025. We are so excited to share that we reached this ambitious target in the first quarter of this year, more than 2 years ahead of our goal. This quarter, we announced plans to accelerate our commitment to hunger relief. Upon completion of the merger with Albertsons, the combined company will donate 10 billion meals by 2030 to feed people struggling with hunger. To put that in perspective, it is enough food to feed every person in the cities of Seattle, Denver, Chicago and Boston every meal, every day for nearly 2 years. This is one of many ways that this proposed merger will benefit the communities we serve. With that now, I will turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?Gary MillerchipThank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's second quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are enabling us to deliver consistent results despite the difficult environment. And this was very much evident when you consider the key trends we saw in our business in quarter 2. While industry-wide disinflation continues to impact food at home sales, our team is doing an excellent job managing the effects of this trend on our business. Key highlights for the quarter include EPS growth despite a significant year-over-year headwind from fuel profitability and underlying operating results excluding fuel improved versus prior year due to strong gross margin management, tight cost controls and continued growth in alternative profit businesses. I'll now provide more detail on our results this quarter. Identical sales without fuel grew 1%. Underlying growth would have been 2.6% after adjusting for the effect of the previously communicated decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first quarter, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin generated excluding fuel and the negative effect on the OG&amp;A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall effect on operating profit during the second quarter was slightly positive, and we would expect this to continue to be the case for the remainder of 2023. Our decision to terminate the agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the long-term best interest of our customers and shareholders. Turning back now to identical sales without fuel. In the second quarter, results were at the low end of our internal expectations as we saw food-at-home inflation decelerate at a faster-than-expected pace. Inflation ended the quarter approximately 350 basis points lower than the start of the quarter. Our sales growth was underpinned by strength in our digital business, which grew 12%. Our unique combination of assets, including stores and fulfillment centers, helped us achieve growth in both pickup and delivery channels. The growth in delivery was led by a continued ramp in volumes through our CFC network and Boost membership. Gross margin was 21.8% of sales. Our FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel increased 35 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. Our team is doing a highly effective job balancing the impact of inflation, and the improvement in rate was primarily attributable to strong Our Brands performance, lower supply chain costs, sourcing benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. These tailwinds were partially offset by higher shrink and promotional price investments. Importantly, as Rodney shared earlier, this improvement in rate was achieved while also improving our price position relative to key competitors. Supply chain efficiency is one of many components of our strategy to expand margin over time while continuing to invest in greater value for our customers. This quarter, we achieved meaningful operational efficiencies in supply chain through improved transport capacity utilization and increased productivity in our warehouses and across our network. We continue to invest in our supply chain as we see significant opportunities to further lower costs while also improving freshness to customers by eliminating waste in our ecosystem. Shrink increased during quarter 2, primarily due to rising theft and organized retail crime. We are implementing initiatives to mitigate the financial impact including increased security and new technology solutions, but would expect shrink trends will continue to be a challenge for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million compared to a charge of $148 million for the same quarter last year. This $144 million year-over-year tailwind from LIFO partially offset the $192 million headwind we experienced in fuel operating profit during the quarter. The decrease in our LIFO charge was primarily attributable to a downwardly revised inflation outlook for the remainder of 2023. Kroger's OG&amp;A rate was flat excluding fuel and adjustment items, Our team continues to do an excellent job controlling costs, and after adjusting for Express Scripts, we saw underlying improvement in our OG&amp;A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items. Our cost-saving initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer. For example, we are improving productivity in our stores by expanding shelf-ready packaging and introducing data-driven enhancements to associate mobile devices that optimize the restocking process. We remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. Fuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program continued to drive customer engagement in the second quarter. The average retail fuel price was $3.65 this quarter compared to $4.62 last quarter. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.45 this quarter compared to $0.62 last year. While fuel profitability was a significant headwind compared to prior year, we were cycling historically high results from 2022 and fuel margins remain very healthy relative to historical trends. I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Dallas Clarks, Southern Illinois Clarkson Meat and Smiths Utah Clarkson Meat, covering more than 30,000 associates. In the third quarter, we have also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drugstore associates. Turning now to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and working capital improvements. At the end of the second quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was a record level of 1.31. This compares to our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA target range of 2.3 to 2.5. The company expects to continue to pay its quarterly dividends and expect this to increase over time, subject to Board approval. As a reminder, we have paused our share repurchase program to prioritize deleveraging following the proposed merger with Albertsons. We continue to be disciplined with our deployment of capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. This discipline is reflected in our ROIC results, which have now improved in each of the last 3 years and is significantly above our cost of capital. This morning, Kroger announced a nationwide opioid settlement framework to settle substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against Kroger. As a result, included in our financial results is a $1.4 billion charge related to the settlement resulting in a loss per share of $1.54 this quarter. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and our adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. Under this settlement, Kroger has agreed to pay up to approximately $1.4 billion or $1.1 billion after tax with approximately $1.2 billion to be paid over 11 years and approximately $177 million to be paid over 6 years, each in equal installments. Initial payments will begin in December 2023 and would total approximately $140 million per year pretax for the first 6 years and approximately $110 million per year pretax for the following 5 years. This settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and Kroger will continue to vigorously defend against any other claims and lawsuits relating to opioids that the final agreement does not resolve. We believe that resolving these claims is in the best interest of Kroger and its customers, associates and shareholders and all of those affected by the opioid crisis. Additionally, this settlement and the payment terms will not affect Kroger's ability to complete its proposed merger with Albertsons, and we remain on track to achieve a net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 within 18 to 24 months post close. In closing, I'd like to provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As I shared earlier, this inflation is occurring at a greater rate in 2023 than we originally anticipated and our customers are continuing to feel the effects of macroeconomic conditions. For these reasons, we believe the remainder of the year will continue to present challenges to navigate, and we expect identical sales without fuel will now be at the low end of our full year guidance range of 1% to 2%. We would expect identical sales without fuel to be slightly negative in the second half of the year. As a reminder, this guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023. Despite slowing sales, as demonstrated in our year-to-date results, we believe we have the flexibility within our model to navigate the impact of this environment through effective cost management and growing alternative profits. We are maintaining our adjusted net earnings per diluted share and adjusted net operating profit guidance and would expect adjusted EPS to be in line with the prior year in the third quarter and slightly ahead of the prior year in the fourth quarter before including the approximately $0.15 benefit at the 53rd week. Kroger delivered another quarter of consistent results built on the foundation of record growth over the past 3 years. While macro uncertainties remain, we are confident the strength and resiliency of our value creation model will allow us to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney.William Rodney McMullenThank you, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons Companies. This morning, Kroger and Albertsons Companies announced that they've entered into a definitive agreement with C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers for the sale of 413 stores as well as banners, distribution centers, offices and private label brands in connection with our proposed merger. When we announced plans to merge with Albertsons last year, we committed to delivering a divestiture plan that would ensure the stores will remain open, frontline associates will remain employed and existing collected bargaining agreements will continue. A critical component of that plan was to identify a well-qualified buyer who would be able to operate as a fierce competitor. Since then, we've conducted a robust and thoughtful diligence process and reviewed dozens of buyers spanning from private to public to union to nonunion, domestic and international players. We are very proud today to announce the conclusion of that process, which has led us to C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, a well-qualified buyer that meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction. C&amp;S is one of the largest private companies in America today and an industry leader in wholesale grocery supply and supply chain solutions with a strong track record as a successful grocery operator retailer. Operating for over 100 years, C&amp;S' retail footprint includes more than 160 stores and the company services customers of all sizes, supplying more than 100,000 products to more than 7,500 independent supermarkets, retail chain stores and military bases. C&amp;S service offerings include a full suite of retail service offerings, very similar to what Kroger provides in house including merchandising, e-commerce, accounting and store design, for example. The company is deeply invested in the communities where it operates. And this retail expansion will continue their long-standing mission to help feed communities. C&amp;S is led by an experienced management team with the financial strength to complete this transaction and also invest in the business for future growth. The company's comprehensive operational infrastructure and purchasing efficiency positions them to successfully operate in today's competitive environment. The divestiture plan ensures no stores will close as a result of the merger and that all frontline associates will remain employed. C&amp;S is also committed to honoring all collective bargaining agreements, which include industry-leading benefits and further investing for growth. Importantly, the company also brings experience with the merger process having been an FTC-approved divestiture buyer in prior grocery transactions with a strong record of successfully integrating union employees and collective bargaining agreements. To help support the immediate and long-term success of the divested business, the divestiture plan includes more than just a collection of stores but also a robust operational infrastructure. Included in the sale are centrally located distribution facilities, regional headquarters, and strong teams with deep industry expertise. In terms of consideration, the financial terms of this divestiture plan are in line with what we expected and allow us to reaffirm the compelling shareholder value creation opportunity this transaction creates. With the announcement today, we are confident that our plans fulfill all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for America's consumers, Kroger and Albertsons associates and communities that both Albertsons and Kroger serve. This key step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We encourage you to review the corresponding press release from this morning for further details. In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well, and it's been exciting to see the talent from both the Kroger and Albertsons teams work together to plan on how the combined company will deliver an even stronger omnichannel food retail experience post close. We are incredibly excited about the future together with Albertsons. As a reminder, given the breadth of information shared in today's call, our divestiture announcement earlier this morning, we will extend our Q&amp;A session if needed to ensure we cover a broad range of topics. With that, Gary and I look forward to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.Simeon Ari GutmanI'm going to ask one and a follow-up in case my phone gets cut off. My first is on disinflation. Wanted to talk about more specifically if there's a chance we get to deflation around the corner in '24 and then how it's changing how you run the business, whether it's pricing, and if you're seeing elasticity. And then a follow-up, a separate question. Was the review process for the merger waiting to begin until this divestiture was announced? Or has the FTC's process been ongoing, and that allows you to close on time?William Rodney McMullenThanks, Simeon. On the merger, there's been ongoing discussions with the FTC and the related teams throughout the process. And once we announce it this morning, we will share this information with the FTC and continue that active engagement and dialogue. So it's -- along the way, there's been ongoing conversations and there'll be continuing ongoing conversations, but now we have more specifics in terms of the next steps that we'll be able to share. On disinflation, I'll start and let Gary finish on it. If you look -- one of the things that Gary reminded me of is if you look in the last 50 years, I think we've had -- or 40 years, I don't remember which one that we had 2 years of deflation when you look at over the last several lifetime almost. One of the things about the Kroger model is that we've found and we're able to be successful operating in any environment both from a competitive standpoint and from an inflation standpoint. And we would expect it to be no different. We are beginning to see some volume improvements as inflation has slowed. We believe that there would continue to be a lag there. We're also finding CPGs, in many cases, are partnering in more aggressive ways on helping us move tonnage as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you finish for the -- any additional comments you want to make?Gary MillerchipYes. Thanks, Rodney. I think you covered it well. All I would say, Simeon, maybe is relative to our expectations. You may recall at the beginning of the year, we shared that we thought inflation might end in the year in sort of the 3% to 4% range. And certainly, as we've seen, trends continue to evolve throughout the year. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would now expect it to be at a lower level than that, which is partly why we've guided to the low end of our sales range for the year. So we would expect inflation now to be in the low single digits, the 1% to 2% range would be our sort of base assumption for the end of the year. And we believe, as Rodney said, that certainly there's always a risk that the scenarios can turn out differently. And we'll continue to adapt our model if we needed to reflect that. But our base assumption would be that we'd expect to sort of return to more normalized very low single digit food inflation which, of course, is what our long-term model is based upon of that sort of 1% to 1.5% inflation rate.OperatorOur next question is from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank.Krisztina KataiI have a strategic question regarding the Albertsons merger. So I guess, historically M&amp;A hasn't added that much value. We look at the businesses now. Margins have remained higher post-COVID, but I think there's a natural question that as ID sales slow, maybe there will be a greater reinvestment needed into the business. So I'd be curious to get your views on the level of reinvestment versus your targeted synergies and if anything has changed regarding your approach versus the October view.William Rodney McMullenYes. If you look at the view today versus October, I would say the biggest positive is I've been incredibly impressed with the talent of the Albertsons team. It doesn't surprise me, but actually getting to know people and working with them and the excitement that there is for the merged company together. If you look at it from a shareholder standpoint, we would feel very comfortable with what things we shared in October of last year in terms of we would expect from a cash flow perspective that it would be 30% accretive by year 4, that the targeted net-to-EBITDA ratio that will maintain investment grade and be within those ranges within 18 to 24 months. If you look at the synergies, we still are comfortable with $1 billion. Obviously, we're going to work really hard to make sure and identify savings beyond that. And we've also committed -- and remember that those are net of investing in our associates and investing for the customer to lower prices. And that's always been part of the plan from day 1 and would expect to. So when you look at overall, we still remain confident in terms of the commitments that we outlined in October. And at this point, we just want to get started and start benefiting our associates, benefiting the customers and benefiting the communities.Gary MillerchipYes. Maybe, Rodney, just a couple of things to add, if I can. I would completely agree with your comments. And we -- obviously, we've had almost a year now since the announcement. And so while there's only certain conversations you can have as Kroger and Albertsons is talking about planning for the merger I would say we've only gained more confidence in the synergy expectations that we've had. So we have been able to continue to validate the assumptions that Rodney outlined a moment ago. I think the only other thing that I would mention is way back to when we announced the merger, we talked about this wasn't just about synergies. It was about essentially fueling the flywheel of the new combined company. And if you think about the results we've announced so far this year, the strength in our results in growing digital sales in our digital ecosystem, the strength in Our Brands performance, the growth in alternative profit streams, there the sort of the future value creation model for the company. And I think the combination of Albertsons and Kroger to combine really creating opportunities to significantly accelerate that flywheel effect across those elements of the model that we see is working very well now, and we think can work even better in the future when we combine the 2 companies.Krisztina KataiAnd just a quick follow-up. The sales transaction with C&amp;S this morning acquiring 413 stores, what is the confidence level in that number? And I think there was a comment that they would be willing to buy up to 650. Can you just maybe talk about the likelihood that it could potentially be that high versus the 413 in today's release?Gary MillerchipSure. Yes, thanks for the question. So we feel very good about the plan. We think the plan is very well thought through. As Rodney shared in prepared comments, we spent almost 10 months now really working with different potential buyers and pulling together both the plan around how we make sure we find the right buyer that will be able to continue to grow those stores successfully in the future and putting an overall structure around the plan with the number of stores that provide that right concentration for a successful model going forward and providing all the infrastructure to support it.So we feel very good about the plan we've announced. We did include in the agreement, as you mentioned, you may recall when we announced the deal originally that our agreement with Albertsons has a sort of a break point, if you like, of where Kroger would have the option to not move forward with the transaction if we reach 650 stores as potential divestitures. So what you saw in the announcement today was that we essentially wanted to make sure we align the agreements between Albertsons and C&amp;S and ourselves to make sure that there is a commitment there to be able to flex up if that was something that was needed. But we feel very good about the plan that we announced today.William Rodney McMullenAnd the announcement today also, no more work will be done in terms of the SpinCo. That's not something that's part of the solution going forward.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.Michael LasserGiven the announcement with C&amp;S today and the flexibility that it offers to divest the number of stores that would be consistent with your agreement with Albertsons, what other basis or push back could the regulators have to blessing this merger? And what actions or steps are you taking today to potentially address those potential concerns?William Rodney McMullenMichael, it's a great question. And obviously, we feel incredibly excited about C&amp;S and what they bring to the table, and they'll be an incredibly fierce competitor. So if you look at the commitments that we made in October last year when we announced the transaction and if you look at selling the stores to C&amp;S, we've been able to check off every one of those boxes. And we're also including 7 distribution centers, 2 regional offices, 5 private label brands in addition to the store. So this is going to be an amazing great business for C&amp;S that we'll be able to operate and grow from an incredible base with incredible talented people. So for us, we think we've addressed all the things and questions the FTC would have. We also were able to accomplish all the commitments we made in October of last year and found a buyer that would recognize the labor contracts as well. So we feel like all those things that you would have a checkoff list, we've met all of those and exceeded it as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that because you and Christine did majority of the work.Gary MillerchipNo, I think you said it well, Rodney. I mean this has been very well thought through. We've had great advisers that helped us on the journey, and we're excited now to talk to the FTC about the plan.Michael Lasser(inaudible) your an annual growth rate -- I'm here. Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Rodney?William Rodney McMullenYes. You cut out. So if you were asking a question -- we can hear you now, but you were cutting off so we couldn't hear what you said.Michael LasserAll right. Sorry about that. Sorry. My question is, if we look at your guidance, for IDs for the back half of the year, which imply slightly negative IDs, is that would translate to 4-year geometric stacks that are relatively consistent with what you experienced in the second quarter despite what is likely to be less of an inflation benefit in the third and the fourth quarter? So inherently, either your volume is going to have to pick up or your market share is going to need to improve, presumably both. So a, to what degree are you going to need to see an improvement in volumes in order for you to achieve the implied guidance? And b, how hard and how -- to what degree are you going to need to push the other parts of your P&amp;L? How much price investment are you going to need to make in order to drive that volume improvement in those share gains?Gary MillerchipMichael, thanks for the question. I think as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we do expect inflation to continue to decelerate. But we are sort of coming through, we think, the largest part of that deceleration. If you look at the number that I mentioned for Q2, it's down 3.5% from the start of the quarter to the end of the quarter, And then my comment about we're expecting to be between the 1% and 2% by the end of the year, we would expect there to be a slowdown in the deceleration rate in inflation impacting our results. And then as you mentioned, if you look at our second quarter results, we saw a sort of a slight decline from being maybe slightly above the 1% that we achieved in Q2 in the first period to being slightly positive in the final period of the quarter. And I share that because the slowdown in growth in sales would have been less than the inflation decline, which is really pointing to your point that we are seeing an improvement in unit trends. And we expect that to continue by leaning into some of the things that are working really well for us around growing households, driving digital sales and then also continuing to execute our plan of delivering more promotions for customers and continuing to execute on the strategy to support that lower-income customer and a budget around accelerating Smart Way, private label products and continuing to deliver those merchandising strategies that connect with that customer in the store as well.OperatorOur next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners.John Edward HeinbockelSo if we think about the old algo on comp, right, which is higher than where we are now, I'm curious, do you think 1% to 2% inflation, as we normalize to that, does that support, right, the algo that you had historically on comp? Or is math and some of the other headwinds, right, work against that? And then I think you said you saw improvement in budget-conscious comps which were negative, I think, 2% last quarter. So is that still negative? And are the higher income households still performing as they did before?William Rodney McMullenI'll start and let Gary talk about the longer-term stuff. But if you look at the higher income household, that growth continues. That customer is meaningfully more profitable because of buying a lot more fresh product and buying bigger-sized products and things. If you look at the budget-conscious shopper, the trends have improved but they would still be negative, but the trends have improved. In terms of relative to the long-term TSR model, Gary, I'll let you...Gary MillerchipSure. and John, I think your question maybe was leaving a little bit between the second half of the year and the long-term plan as well. So I would definitely think about it in those 2 buckets. I wouldn't say that we're changing our long-term growth algorithm view that we believe food-at-home will continue to grow in that sort of 2% to 3% a year over the long term and we will expect to grow top line between 2% and 4% and deliver earnings growth of 3% to 5% by both achieving growth in line with slightly ahead of the market and also continuing to expand margin through the different levers that we talked about during our various Investor Days. I think in the short term, when we think about the rest of the year, I would use the first half as a sort of decent sense of how we're thinking about the rest of the year. We would expect to continue to see some tailwinds in our gross margin rate around some of the areas that I mentioned in the prepared remarks on supply chain and Our Brands, sourcing benefits, et cetera. OG&amp;A will continue to manage costs very closely given that the environment is, to your point, lower in terms of the headline growth rate than we would be expecting in our long term models. So we'll be managing costs accordingly. And obviously, we do continue to flex our model to make sure that we're adjusting our plans when we have those short-term adjustments to what we see in the upcoming environment.John Edward HeinbockelAnd then maybe as a quick follow-up. What is the update now on the Ocado process in terms of rollout and adoption? I mean, we've talked about it a bit and movement toward your profitability objective. Where are we on all of that relative to -- and you talked about pickup?William Rodney McMullenYes. If you look at the sheds, continued great progress on the growth in the sheds and the base operating model. Right now, all the energy is focused on the ones we have and making sure that those are where we want them to be, where they need to be and on a sustainable basis. The other thing that I think is incredibly important is if you look at the repurchase rate once somebody starts using the shed and the NPS scores, they remain very high. So I would say that a ton of work is being done. We're making progress, but we wouldn't be to the point where we would start focusing on additional sheds until we make sure that we have a clear path on the ones we have, and we are making meaningful progress but we still have a lot of work to do.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI.Michael David MontaniJust wanted to ask about ESI. So one question earlier was related to market share and why that might improve towards the end of the year, thinking that could be part of it. But I wanted to ask at a high level, would you be comfortable kind of going it alone if you can't seem to find a good partner? And then what could some of the longer-term benefits be to the business model, if that is the case?William Rodney McMullenYes. On ESI, first of all, I am incredibly proud of our pharmacy teams. They've done an amazing job on being able to retain a meaningful part of those customers, and it's a combination of doing direct contracting with some companies and also leveraging our discount card for patients. So -- when you look at overall, I think they've done an incredible job on minimizing the effect. Now with that said, it's still over -- about 1.5%, or I think this quarter, I think we shared 1.6%. We're very comfortable with where we are but we're always focused on trying to make sure we're taking care of the customers and taking care of patients. But we have to be able to do that in a way where we don't lose money on every prescription filled. So that's really what the focus is on, and we feel very comfortable with where we are. Gary, anything you want to add to that?Gary MillerchipNo, I think it's all good, thanks.Michael David MontaniJust wanted to follow up, if I could, quickly on the potential multiple implied by the transaction for the divested stores, have had some pushback. It seems to be around 2 to 2.5x, which was a little less than we thought. So I didn't know if you could discuss that potentially in the context of the ability to increase the stores divested if needed to close the deal vis-a-vis what the potential profitability might be of those locations.Gary MillerchipYes. Thanks for the question. I think maybe the confusion could be around the multiple and what we were assuming because the -- I think the only previous information that we've shared was relative to SpinCo, which was potentially a solution for a part of the overall divestiture plan. It wouldn't have been actually a solution for all geographies, but that was the 100 stores to 375 stores that were contemplated in the SpinCo structure. And we mentioned or shared in that agreement that the multiple could be 3x fall on EBITDA. So this multiple would be a little bit below that number. But that being said, as Rodney mentioned in the prepared comments, we haven't actually assumed in our modeling that the transaction would move forward with a different number than we actually announced today. And in actual fact, the number would be very much in line with what we were contemplating. We believe it's a good solution for our shareholders because, as Rodney mentioned, it actually solves for all the elements that are important to a divestiture plan. It will help us longer term in being able to simplify a transition services, to be able to manage the new combined company more effectively and drive future value for our shareholders. And we believe it's also a price that allows CNS to be able to be a successful operator in the future as well. So very much consistent with what we were thinking and would keep us on track with the commitments that we shared when we announced the deal back in October.OperatorOur next question is from Kenneth B. Goldman from JPMorgan.Kenneth B. GoldmanYou mentioned you're seeing volumes start to improve a little bit. It's kind of going the other way for a lot of your branded, I guess, center store packaged food vendors. You highlighted that your store brands are doing better. Maybe that explains much of the difference. But I'm also curious if you're seeing consumers change their behavior a little bit in terms of which departments they're shopping. And I guess the core question there is, has there been a boost that you're seeing to your perimeter maybe at the expense of the center store? Just wanted to get a little more color on where those volumes are getting, I don't know if less bad is the right phrase, or better?William Rodney McMullenYes. In terms of volume, there's a couple of things. One, if you look at like in the meat department, for an example, you're seeing people much more move to hamburger meat or we call it grinds, but I don't know that many people publicly would do that, or chicken and some of those things. So you are starting to see some improvement in tonnage relative to that. You are also seeing people moving to the entry price point in many cases. And obviously, that would be affecting the CPGs. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are beginning to see some CPGs be more aggressive on partnering, on moving their tonnage as well. So all of those things are happening, but you're never satisfied with where you are. But the trends are starting to improve, and there's a ton of focus on making sure that we're supporting that customer on a budget as well.Kenneth B. GoldmanAnd then as a follow-up, I think what concerns some investors about disinflation and possible deflation is that even though deflation has been a rare thing, the last time it came around it did last for a fairly long time, a couple of years. It helped drive a competitive environment in which gross margins actually declined and your core operating income was down as well. So I guess what I'm curious about is, what gives you the confidence that -- in a world where consumers are struggling more, that your competitors will remain as rational as they are today? And to what extent does your guidance potentially factor the risk of them being a little bit less rational, I guess?William Rodney McMullenYes. We always -- when you look at our long-term model, we always assume the market will get more competitive than it is because that's been the case for the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and customers get the benefit of that. The other thing that's built into our model that's different today is if you look at our diversified income streams, alternative businesses are well north of $1 billion. That business didn't even exist the last time when the economy was tough, as an example. If you look at from a seamless standpoint, the retail media which is obviously part of the alternative profit business, those margins are completely different than the supermarket margins. So all of those things are things that are part of the model and part of the long-term thinking. But the thing that I think is always important to remind people is even in the scenario you've outlined, we still were significantly above our cost of capital, significantly generating economic value for shareholders, the stock price didn't but if you look at the value of the company. And we continue to generate cash flow that we used to pay a dividend and buy back stock and balance our debt. So all of those things, I think, are important parts of it but it is a different market model today than it was the last time.OperatorOur next question is from Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo.Edward Joseph KellyGuys, can you hear me?William Rodney McMullenWe can now. Go ahead, Ed.Robinson C. QuastWe'll move on to the next question.OperatorOur next question is from Kelly Bania from BMO.Kelly Ann BaniaThis is Kelly Bania. I think I'm up. Thanks, Ed. I guess...William Rodney McMullenWe can hear you, Kelly.Kelly Ann BaniaGood. I wanted to ask about the divestiture package. I think the comment was made that the valuation for this is slightly below the 3x 4-wall EBITDA that the SpinCo was structured at. And so I guess, just can you comment on why that would be in Kroger's best interest to accept a lower valuation than what was available through SpinCo if that was a viable option? And are you willing to share the estimated EBITDA or EBITDA margin for these planned 413 stores?Gary MillerchipKelly, yes, thanks for the question. Essentially, when we think about the SpinCo option that we announced when we communicated the merger with Albertsons, just as a sort of a recap, SpinCo was an option that was always going to be a solution alongside other solutions. The package that would have been involved with SpinCo as a group of stores would have covered certain geographies, but it would not have covered the whole of the store footprint geographically that would need to be divested that we always sort of contemplated as part of the plan to take to the FTC. So we would always have had to have put together SpinCo with another buyer, which adds significant complexity both from the perspective of working with 2 different companies around their future plans to take forward to the FTC, but also the complexity around transition services agreement, technology solutions, sort of implementing, if you like, a period of time where the companies need to operate and separate effectively. So when we looked at the options that were available, I would say that from day 1, we always viewed SpinCo as a viable option. But if we believe we could find a single buyer that was able to do everything that C&amp;S can do, which is bring a strong plan, a strong capable management team, a well-capitalized balance sheet, commitment to investing in the business in the future and then being able to put together a set of assets for them that will enable them to do that, we always believed that, that would likely be both a more effective solution to move forward with but also, longer term, a better solution for Kroger to be able to execute on a plan. So it's why -- I know we didn't go into specific details when we announced the transaction back in October. But when we assumed evaluation in our models with the commitments that we shared around being accretive to EPS in year 1 without onetime costs and improvement of $1 billion of synergy over 4 years, and all the other metrics that we shared, all of that was based on a valuation that's essentially in line with the valuation that we announced today with C&amp;S. So very consistent with what we were assuming. But obviously, the only answer we could actually share when we announced the deal was SpinCo because we haven't had chance to talk to any buyers at that point. That was the only plan that was really fully baked through as part of the discussions with Albertsons.Kelly Ann BaniaOkay. That's very helpful. And would -- should we assume that the additional 200 potential stores would be under a similar or the same valuation? Just a quick question there. And then also, can you help us understand the financing structure and the commitment from C&amp;S partner here with SoftBank to this transaction and the potential for the incremental 200 stores?Gary MillerchipYes. Thanks, Kelly. Well, first of all, in terms of the incremental stores, we certainly share more details on that if that was required. But as we shared earlier, we feel really good about the plan that we have. We believe it's a very strong package and it really does address all of the questions and feedback that we've sort of received and evaluated as we thought about the plan. So our focus is really on moving forward with that plan. But we did think it was important to build flexibility into the agreement so that if we have to flex, we're able to do that. I wouldn't be able to comment on C&amp;S' financing strategy. That's obviously specific to them, and that will be something for them to comment on if they wanted to. I would just say that from our perspective, we got very comfortable with their financing strategy and feel they both have the financial strength to be able to complete the transaction but also the financial strength to be able to keep investing in the business going forward as well.OperatorOur next question is from Rupesh Parry from Oppenheimer.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhSo I just wanted to touch on the promotional competitive backdrop. Just curious what you guys are seeing right now in the promotional environment. Any changes on the competitive front lately? And then just curious, as there is waning inflation out there and there is a clear desire for the industry to drive volumes, so just curious if you guys expect it to become more promotional in the coming months or quarters.William Rodney McMullenYes. If you look at overall, the promotional activity is getting close to where it was pre-COVID. So it's pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. And obviously during COVID, the supply chains were such a mess and it's really those are recovering. If you look at the conversations with CPGs, it's getting -- for the most part it's getting much more back to normal in terms of how do you grow units. And the CPGs, in some cases, raise their own margins and now they're starting to focus on tonnage again. So for us, we feel like it's a good healthy dialogue and it's one of the reasons, as you know, that we believe Our Brands is such an important part of our overall go-to-market equation for customers. Because if the CPGs are doing things that aren't justifiable, Our Brands always gain share because we have an amazing set of products. And when people try them, the repeat rate is incredibly strong as well.Rupesh Dhinoj ParikhGreat. And then maybe just 1 follow-up question. So as you look at the consumer backdrop for the balance of the year, is your team assuming it stays pretty similar to what you've seen recently? Or do you expect to get worse? And just -- I also wanted to just get a sense of how you think about student loan impacts on grocery.William Rodney McMullenYes, That's -- I was going to say if you hadn't added the last part, that's the one part where we do expect it will get -- from an environment standpoint, from a consumer standpoint, that it will be a little tougher is the student loan repayments. And you don't know for sure until it happens. We do believe that the impact on grocery would be less than other categories. So we've assumed that to be a headwind, but the specifics until it happens, you just don't know.Gary MillerchipAnd on that, Rupesh, when we talk to customers about it we know it's going to be a meaningful financial impact on their overall budget, which obviously creates some risk that we've factored into our thinking. What customers also say, though, is that one of the first places they go to adjust their budgets to pay for the incremental cost is to eat more food at home versus eating out. So it would be interesting to see if that turns out to be a trend that's helpful over time as well.OperatorOur next question is from Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo.Edward Joseph KellyGuys, can you hear me now?William Rodney McMullenWe can. It sounds like a commercial.Edward Joseph KellyAll right. I thought you were going to say you can't, so I'm happy to hear that you can. I wanted to ask about the sustainability of margin opportunity going forward. If we look at the back half of this year with, I guess, minimal comp, and it seems like maybe that's the environment for next year as well, you are getting benefit out of LIFO, gross margin, cost control is really good. But how do we think about the potential for continued improvement in those type of areas in '24 to offset what traditionally would be an environment where it's really difficult for grocers to actually get any earnings growth or even keep earnings flat?Gary MillerchipYes, Ed, it's a great question. What I would say is, as you know, we typically don't get into like forward guidance beyond the current year until later in the year. But what I would maybe comment on is if you look at the areas that we've called out as being tailwinds during the quarter that helped us on the gross margin rate, we think of those as more long-term drivers of our model versus sort of short-term, one-time benefit cycling prior activity in our business. And what I mean by that is if we look at Our Brands, Rodney mentioned it on the call earlier, but we've been doing a tremendous amount of work with our merchandising team in Our Brands really focusing on how do we continue to improve the portfolio both in terms of how we architect the products to get the maximum reach and value from each different product category across private selection, Simple Truth, Kroger brand and the Smart Way product range, how do we continue to innovate, how do we drive sourcing best practices. So really kind of taking almost a CPG type mindset to that approach to our products and saying, how do we maximize value. And I would say the team would probably tell you they're maybe 1/3 of the way through that work right now. So still a lot of opportunity, we believe, to continue to get stronger in Our Brands performance. From a supply chain perspective, I mentioned it in my comments, but we continue to invest significantly in the supply chain because the team is doing a great job identifying ways in which we believe we can continue to drive efficiency in our supply chain strategy by leveraging data more effectively and technology, continuing to optimize the routes that we're taking, the capacity that we're utilizing on those routes. And we believe there's still, again, a significant opportunity ahead of us there. Alternative profit, you've heard us talk about before as being we're still in the early innings of our mind about the potential for alternative profits can be, particularly as we keep growing digital and driving engagement through our Kroger Precision Marketing business. So I think, overall, we would say that we've been on a journey for a few years that we've talked to investors about how do we manage these levers to be able to continue to improve profitability over time. And I'd say we have a good degree of confidence that we see continued plans in those areas. Now all that being said, obviously, we're going to continue to invest in the customer and continue to deliver more value there to balance that model so that we're driving top line growth over time as well.Edward Joseph KellyAll right. And just a quick follow-up. I don't think Albertsons has had a large opioid settlement yet. Is that correct?William Rodney McMullenThat would be correct.OperatorOur next question is from Robert Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Robert Frederick OhmesCan you guys hear me okay?William Rodney McMullenYes, Robbie.Robert Frederick OhmesExcellent. You can hear me. Great. Two follow-up questions on the C&amp;S deal. The first one, just the ADCs 2 headquarters -- regional headquarters, I guess, and the 5 private brands. Was that part of the original October outlined? Or is that sort of unique to this deal with C&amp;S?William Rodney McMullenYes. It's actually part -- it was one of those things where we knew that it would be part of the consideration. But until you had a specific buyer, you wouldn't know the specifics. So we had always had in the back of our mind that, that was something that might be needed in order to find a buyer that would be able to day 1 hit the ground running. But it wasn't -- it was one of those things where we could have managed it either way, depending on what the particular needs of that particular buyer would have been.Gary MillerchipAnd the only thing I would add maybe, Rodney -- Robbie, would be that if you think about SpinCo, of course, SpinCo was going to be -- had to be set up as a full separate company. So it would have to be meaningful assets that would have moved with SpinCo for it to be a viable solution, not having any infrastructure other than what would have to move across from some of the Albertsons or Kroger business today. So that would have been probably more meaningful in terms of the impact that we sort of move forward with a buyer like C&amp;S.Robert Frederick OhmesGot you. That's helpful. And then it looks like there's a fair amount of Kroger and Harris Teeter stores as part of the plan. Was that part of the October thinking or like I noticed the Harris Teeter stores, I guess, in Virginia, like was that part of the original thinking? Or is there a greater mix of Kroger banners as part of this?William Rodney McMullenIt was always part of the original thinking that some of the stores to be divested would be best for it to be Kroger stores. So that wasn't something that was new to the analysis that was done late last year.Robert Frederick OhmesGot it. And what's the total Kroger banner stores in the C&amp;S announcement?William Rodney McMullenYes. There isn't a specific number yet. We're still in the middle of the dialogue with the FTC so there wouldn't be specifics. In the press release, it wouldn't show by state the number of stores and the banners, but not -- there wouldn't be specifics at this point.Robert Frederick OhmesGot you. And just last question, is there any difference in the expected dilution in year 1, whether you do 650 or 411?Gary MillerchipYes, As I mentioned earlier, Robbie, we're really focused on the 413 store plan because we have a high degree of confidence that, that addresses all the areas that we think are important to have a viable operator in the markets that we're divesting stores. And we believe the package is really effective in solving for that. So what we shared with the guidance back in October would still be very consistent now in our thinking based on the plans that we're moving forward with. And if obviously, if our plans were to change over time, we would share more details around that. But we feel we've got a really strong plan, and we feel the guidance that we've shared, nothing at this point would say that we have anything that would be a concern to move away from those guidances that we shared. And if anything, I would say, between the work that we've done now to identify the buy with C&amp;S and some of the additional work we've been able to do in planning for the merger with -- in some respects with Albertsons, gives us a high degree of confidence that the plans that we shared are still very much the expectation.OperatorOur final question today comes from Dean Rosenblum from Bernstein.Dean RosenblumI have 2 questions regarding the divested stores. The first question is there's a big debate about whether you guys are going to allow the acquirer now known as C&amp;S to operate the stores under the banners that they're currently operating on. And I guess it's 2-part question there. One is if you -- are you going to allow C&amp;S to operate the stores under their existing banners, yes or no? And if not, do you have any idea what the plan is for C&amp;S in terms of rebranding the stores? And then the second question is you mentioned 160 stores that C&amp;S operates at retail. Can you share some detail on where those stores are actually located? Because there's very little geographic overlap between existing Piggly Wiggly stores and the locations where you've announced the divested stores to be.Gary MillerchipSure. Yes. Thanks for the question. So just to clarify on the bannering, what we shared this morning was that C&amp;S will be provided with 3 banners that we'll be divesting as part of the plan, so Mariano's, QFC and Carrs are all banners that they will be essentially acquiring as part of the divestiture package. And they will also receive a license to operate under the Albertsons banner in 4 states, so that would be California, Colorado, Wyoming and...William Rodney McMullenArizona.Gary MillerchipArizona. Thanks, Rodney. So essentially, C&amp;S, I won't speak for what their plans are. That's obviously their decision to move forward. But they will have the right to be able to use those banners and Albertsons in the 4 states I mentioned and the 3 other banners in any states they choose to use them and operate the stores. So that will be a decision they will make over time. But they would not keep -- if they ultimately buy stores that are different banners than those 4 today, they would need to rebanner those stores over a period of time.William Rodney McMullenAnd the stores they operate, Piggly Wiggly would be in the Midwest and the South, and the Grand Union would be in the Northeast.Gary MillerchipYes. We think that's a compelling part of the plan actually for C&amp;S because it will introduce a new competitor in the markets where they have infrastructure and capability but are able to present a new competitor in that market as well.William Rodney McMullenYes. Thanks, Dean. And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. As always, I'd like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in. As the back-to-school season gets underway, we want to wish all families good luck on the upcoming school year and acknowledge our own associates who continue their education through our Feed Your Future program. Feed Your Future is our continuing education benefit that provides up to $21,000 for each associate over the course of their career to cover continuing education. We are proud that since the program started in 2018, more than 16,000 associates have utilized this benefit with approximately 91% of these participants are being hourly associates. We're so thankful that you've chosen to grow your career with Kroger, and we're excited to see that number to continue to increase and we've committed to bringing this benefit to Albertsons once we merge as well. And then in closing, overall, Kroger is delivering consistent results, which reflect the strength of our business model that we've talked about in a challenged environment. By managing costs and growing alternative profit streams, we drove earnings growth and generated strong free cash flow again this quarter. We are proud of our ability to deliver these results while creating value for our customers. We are thankful for our incredible associates and their dedication to providing our customers a full, fresh and friendly experience. We are excited about the significant step Kroger has taken to fulfill our merger commitments through the divestiture plan, and we remain committed to fulfilling all the commitments we set out last year when we announced our proposed merger with Albertsons. Thanks again for everyone for joining us today. That concludes today's call.OperatorThis concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

Now let me turn the call over to Doug.Doug Howe : Good morning, everyone. Before discussing this quarter's performance, I want to thank our team for their dedication and hard work during the quarter that played out against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Because of our team's commitment to improving results, I am pleased to share that we posted overall comps that improved throughout the quarter in addition to posting sequential improvement from the first quarter. Our gross margin also increased year-over-year as well as sequentially and marked the second highest Q2 rate over the past decade. Sequential improvement along though is not enough. Within our organization, we are committed to producing year-over-year growth across our top and bottom lines. As we work towards achieving that goal consistently, I'm pleased with our team's efforts to continue reading and reacting to a highly promotional environment while simultaneously managing our inventory to an appropriate healthy level in both our retail and brand segments.Story continuesWe are also showcasing consistent operational progress. From an own brand perspective, we are very excited to have launched a completely new athleisure brand, Le TIGRE in the first month of Q3, and we are rolling out new collaborations as we diversify and strengthen our portfolio, which will drive our profitability over the longer term. I also want to take a moment to highlight a very important hire we made during the month of July. I'm thrilled to announce that Laura Denk has been brought on board as the new President of Designer Shoe Warehouse. Laura joins us with an incredible resume that includes time at Macy's, Claire and Michaels stores, most recently as Michaels Chief Merchandising Officer. Laura will bring her extensive merchandising background, ability to forge strong vendor partnerships, knowledge of augmenting customer experiences and importantly positioning and elevating owned and national brands within our DSW specific channels.With her leadership, we'll be growing our credibility as an on-trend brand builder and retailer. This will help us drive the next phase of growth and will allow me more time to focus on DBI's overall strategic priorities including driving our own brand's performance, both inside and outside of the DSW. Please join me in welcoming Laura. I recently hit the 100-day mark in my new seat as DBI's CEO, and I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress we've made and the actions we are taking to ensure we are well positioned for our next phase of growth. It has become increasingly clear to me that we have two distinct and valuable businesses, our legacy retail business and our new and growing brands business. Combined, they give us distinctive synergies that do not exist elsewhere in the industry.Laura's hire follows the organizational realignments we instituted a few months ago, which aim to align our talent and resources more closely with the needs of our different businesses, while setting the foundation for strong strategic growth. Additionally, we recently announced that Bill Jordan will be stepping down from the business. With this change, we intend to hire a seasoned brand builder to help lead our growing brands business. We are immensely thankful for the work Bill has led, to help made Designer Brands where it is today and wish him the very best. Designer Brands truly is unlike any other company in the footwear industry, and I firmly believe we have unique advantages that will deliver strategic growth into the future. Turning to our quarter's results, in the second quarter, Designer Brands net sales declined 7.8% compared to the second quarter of last year but improved 290 basis points versus the first quarter decline, driven by increasing strength in our casual offerings.Total retail comps were down 8.9%, while wholesale net sales were up roughly 20% versus last year as we integrate the Keds and Topo Athletic brands and launched our newest brand, Le TIGRE. Our long-term strategy of doubling sales of our own brands from 2021 to 2026 remains a top priority, and we continue to move full speed ahead on our journey. Year-to-date through the second quarter, our own brands penetration, including wholesale sales increased year-over-year by 60 basis points to 25% of total DBI revenue. This progress has continued into the third quarter. We are thrilled with the recent launch of Le TIGRE. We are equally proud that Topo Athletic has seen steady growth and continues to meet our expectations in terms of performance. We are also excited to continue building our success with Hush Puppies as we have now become the exclusive licensee in the U.S. and Canada, including new DTC channels and international expansion.Ranked fifth by people.com for the hottest fashion launches you need to shop for this summer, on August 1, Le TIGRE launched as our newest brand. And as of 8/14, customers were able to buy the brand at DSW. As a reminder, Le TIGRE is new to the footwear space, and we are thrilled their inaugural athletic athleisure launch is with us. The Le TIGRE brand was established in 1977, rooted in New York City street culture and timeless style, and we are bringing the Born in the City, Raised in the Wild, Ready for Anything spirit to this new collection. Their footwear line includes both women's and men's selections inspired by vintage athletic design and loaded with modern day comfort. I couldn't be more excited about the work and the strategic approach that has gone into this launch, our first ever launch of a new national brand.Turning to Hush Puppies, we recently signed an agreement to become the exclusive licensee of the brand in the U.S. and Canada. This was highly informed by the special relationship DSW already had with Wolverine related to exclusive U.S. distribution and is a stellar expansion to our comfort and casual categories in owned brands. Now as the official license, we'll take over the hushpuppies.com business, which will be our sixth independent e-commerce site, and we will have the ability to wholesale the brand in North America. Hush Puppies growth within DSW has been robust, up nearly 60% of the quarter versus last year, driven by men's with growth across casual, dress and boots. Excitingly, our first product expression is anticipated for spring of 2024.Returning to our progress in the quarter at Keds, our integration continues to advance as expected. We also launched exciting collaborations in the quarter, both with Recreational Habits and stock. First, our Recreational Habits partnership produced a sophisticated take on the court sneaker in classic white and grey colorways. Complementary to this, our Saks launch is designed to cater to the latest Pickleball Craze and court sports enthusiasts. We've implemented marketing activations at Saks complemented by a robust influencer and digital campaign. As part of this launch, we excited customers with an actual pick of all top of court inside of Saks Fifth Avenue store in New York during July. As part of our exclusive launch, the product was initially available only through Saks Fifth Avenue and [indiscernible] channels.And later this month, we are bringing the in-house to be hosted exclusively on keds.com beginning on September 22. At Crown Vintage, Emma Robert's first curated collection Emma's Fits launched during the quarter. This included engaging video content on dsw.com which drove positive customer interactions and buzz. We also have new content coming with Emma in October around seasonal boots and booties. This long-term partnership continues to strengthen our brand positioning and relevance with our Crown Vintage target customer. At Vince Camuto, we're pleased to have launched our first men's franchise shoe line, FLY365, a dress-meets-casual style hybrid shoe collection. As we build out this franchise which sets this line apart from the rest of the pack is the use of special technologies and production, not often found in non-athletic men's shoes, including features like a supportive cupsole for stability, a cushioned lightweight midsole for weight reduction and energy return and a rubber outsole for traction and durability.We have merged the European inspired Vince Camuto aesthetic with technical comfort innovation to target the modern male customer who is less likely to compromise on comfort in the post-COVID world. In fact 365 was recently highlighted in Footwear News. Growing our men's business across all of DBI remains one of our largest white space opportunities and we believe represents a significant growth lever over the long-term. We believe that our new offerings from Vince Camuto and Le TIGRE will help us gain traction with male customers that are increasingly prioritizing the unification of comfort and style. Our continued success was evident in our Q2 results, where we saw Vince Camuto men's sales up 95% in dot.com. We are also committed to strengthening our relationships and expanding our business with the national brands that are most relevant to our customers.This strategy remains on track as we continue leveraging our position as the top point of distribution. As part of our edit and amplify strategy, we continue to be excited with our Nike partnership that we announced last quarter. We will leverage this relationship to provide an athletic offering across men's, women's and kids, giving our customers an elevated physical and digital assortment. Finally, we continue to be more cognizant of providing increased value to our customers. One of our greatest strengths is our long-standing vendor relationships and associated opportunistic closeout buys with large national brands. As such, as part of our long-term relationship with Wolverine, we executed an advantageous buy that provided us with an opportunity to offer compelling savings to our customers on Sperry, Saucony, Merrell and Chalco products in the quarter.We look forward to offering additional events for our customers in the fall. Before I hand it over to Jared, I'm going to quickly speak to our full year outlook. Although we anticipate macro pressures will continue through the end of the year and in fact, have the potential to increase, today, we reaffirm our full year 2023 guidance, supported by the sequential improvement we saw from Q1 into Q2. We still have our Septober and holiday selling season ahead of us, and we continue to be laser-focused on meeting and driving demand with on-trend product. Jared will go into more detail on this in a few moments. As we move forward, we continue to prioritize value-creating opportunities and are committed to returning capital to our shareholders. In fact, year-to-date, through September 5, Designer Brands has returned $91.1 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.I'll let Jared speak more on our strategic capital allocation plans for the back half of fiscal '23. I look forward to updating you all on our strategic initiatives as we move through the back half of the year. With that, I'll pass it over to Jared. Jared?10 Most Cushioned Walking Shoes for WorkPhoto by Kelvin Han on UnsplashJared Poff : Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate Doug's comments and say how excited I am to welcome Laura Denk as our new President of DSW. She will be a tremendous asset in driving our strategic vision for our DSW business, focusing on tactical merchandising, marketing and our overall experience, all of which will be anchored to our current and target customers. We believe that there is meaningful growth to be had at DSW and that Laura's leadership will help us unlock that growth. I share Doug's feeling of pride in our organization and this team's ability to continue managing through the increasingly challenging current environment, allowing us to deliver a second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.59, in line with our expectations.We saw sequential improvement over the first quarter in both our sales and gross margin. And as a result, we are reaffirming our current full year guidance despite continued industry and macro headwinds. Now let me provide a bit more detail on our financial results. For the second quarter, sales decreased 7.8% from last year to $792.2 million and an improvement from the first quarter's results. The continued pressure on consumers, high inventory across the industry and an extremely promotional retail environment, all contributed to this decrease. From a wholesale perspective, sales were up roughly 20%, driven by the acquisition of Keds, our launch of Le TIGRE and acquisition of Topo Athletic. In our retail segments, total retail comps were down 8.9% compared to last year, but improved sequentially from the first quarter.U.S. retail costs specifically were down 9.2% in the quarter, but also sequentially improved from a pressured Q1. While Canada posted comps down 7.3% in the quarter, this was on top of a very strong post-COVID recovery comp of just over 47% in the second quarter of 2022. We remain pleased with the results we are seeing at vincecamuto.com, one of our premier DTC channels with comps up 50 basis points on top of roughly 43% comp last year. Consolidated gross margin was 34.5% in the second quarter compared to 34.4% last year, an increase of 10 basis points and a sequential improvement of 250 basis points versus last quarter. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by lower markdowns. Importantly, our gross margin continues to be fundamentally strong with consolidated gross margin up 400 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2019.Year-over-year profitability improvement was also driven by consolidation of our fulfillment centers and significantly lower logistics costs, including freight, shipping and distribution expense. The impact of consolidating our fulfillment centers, specifically the Columbus Fulfillment Center into the New Jersey ECLC allowed us to achieve a more favorable level of fixed and variable expense leverage. This benefit was partially offset by increased promotions, the continued rebuilding of our clearance business and deleverage of our fixed store occupancy cost. Our adjusted SG&amp;A ratio for the second quarter was 26.9% of sales compared to 26.5% in the second quarter of 2022. Although we are experiencing modest deleverage given our current retail out performance, we saw sequential improvement from a dollar and rate perspective versus first quarter.Going forward, increased marketing investment to build brand equity and maintain customer awareness could put pressure on sustaining this ratio. This trend may see volatility as we continue rolling out our new DTC sites and execute other strategic initiatives, but we will continue to pursue opportunities to trim costs across the entire business. For the second quarter, adjusted operating profit was 7.9% of sales compared to 8.2% in the prior year and sequentially improved from 3.5% in the first quarter of 2023. In the second quarter, we had $6.9 million of net interest expense and our effective tax rate on our adjusted results was 29.3% compared to 31.8% last year. Finally, our second quarter adjusted net income was $39.4 million or $0.59 diluted EPS versus $46.1 million or $0.62 last year, and $35.8 million or $0.48 in 2019.We ended the second quarter with inventories of $606.8 million, down roughly 13% compared to $694 million last year and down sequentially from $637.4 million in the first quarter. On a retail inventory square footage basis, we ended down 10% versus the second quarter of 2022 and down 4% compared to Q1 2023. Wholesale inventory ended the second quarter down 10% and adjusted for the acquisition of Topo and Keds, inventory would have been down 33% when compared to last year. Because we have remained nimble in our approach to our assortment, we feel good about our inventory positioning heading into fall, ensuring we have the flexibility necessary to chase and take action on opportunistic buys. As a reminder, at the end of the last quarter, we announced the commencement of our Dutch Auction Tender offer, which allowed us to invest in our own stock.In mid-July, we announced the final results of the offer, which included repurchasing $14.7 million of our Class A common stock at a price of $10 per share under our existing Board-approved share repurchase program. As always, we maintain an ongoing dialogue between management and our Board of Directors on our capital allocation strategy. Together, we continue to believe that our most prudent use of capital at this time is to return it to our shareholders. As a result, we have continued to purchase shares in the open market. We view this as a vote of confidence in our long-term strategy. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2023, based on trading date, we returned $32.9 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Thus far in the third quarter, we have added to that total by $58.3 million through September 5, thanks to the continued open market repurchases.We ended the quarter with $46.2 million of cash and our total liquidity, which includes cash and availability under our revolver of $279.9 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had $233.7 million available to draw on our revolving credit facility. However, given the share repurchase activity mentioned previously that has occurred since the end of the second quarter, our current availability to draw on our revolving credit facility was $227.9 million as of 9/5/2023. As a reminder, to help fund our capital allocation priorities, we previously announced that we had entered into a five-year term loan. Upon closing that facility, on June 23, 2023, we immediately drew $50 million under the term loan and anticipate drawing the additional $85 million throughout the course of the year.The proceeds of that subsequent draw will immediately be used to pay down outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility. We continue to await the receipt of the remaining $40 million of our CARES Act tax refund due to us from the IRS. We are happy to report that the IRS has formally closed our standard audit for which this refund applies with no adjustments. And as such, we are now simply waiting on the refund request to work its way through the appropriate approval channels at the IRS and Treasury Department for ultimate funding. Before I conclude, I want to share a few remarks on our current guidance. As discussed last quarter, our updated guidance assumes the continued pullback in consumer spending with a recovery delayed until later in the year.Consistent with prior views, the largest uncertainty continues to lie squarely with a discretionary consumer while also contemplating a multitude of other pressures, including competitive inventory, the health of the consumer and overall macroeconomic headwinds. Our current guidance assumes that our retail comp performance improves throughout the balance of the year as the macro pressures on the consumer begin to subside and as our prior year comparables become lighter. That being said, pressures continue to weigh on the consumer, and therefore, potential for headwinds to worsen remains. I do want to cover a few updates within our assumptions. With the previously discussed repurchase activity, our share count is now expected to be approximately 64 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2023.With the new term loan, interest expense is now expected to be approximately $35 million for the full year. Thus the incremental interest of the term loan essentially offsets the benefit of the lower weighted average outstanding share count for our fiscal 2023 EPS figure. Additionally, our estimated tax rate is anticipated to be 30%. With all of this in mind, and given the sequential improvement seen in our most recent quarter in terms of sales and margins, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 EPS guidance range of $1.20 to $1.50. As Doug noted, we have made incredible progress in our evolution as a company, including recent leadership hires, launches of new brands, growing with existing brand partners and accelerating our journey as a brand builder.I have strong conviction in our path forward. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator?See also 15 Most Valuable Pre-IPO Companies in The World and 10 Best Stocks To Buy For A Stock Market Game.Q&amp;A SessionOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Gaby Carbone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Gaby Carbone : Good morning. Thanks for all the color today. So first, I was wondering if you could maybe discuss the changes you saw in category performance, if any, from 2Q versus 1Q. And then as we look to the fall season, obviously, the boot category becomes quite important. Just curious how you're thinking about inventory there. Thank you.Doug Howe : Yeah. Thanks, Gaby. This is Doug. There's really two category performance where we continue to see buoyancy in the casual category. Obviously, the capitalization trend just continues to gain momentum. [Indiscernible] reacting to that with managing the inventory. So again, we feel really good about that business in particular. Second point, we have a dominant penetration in the new category. It's very, very early on. We talked a lot about Septober, which is the key time for boot selling. So I think the majority of that season is ahead of us all. We are seeing some nice initial results on fashion goods, particularly driven by western. So we're cautiously optimistic about that. But again, the majority of the season is still ahead of us.Gaby Carbone : Got it. And if I could just sneak in one more. So moving ahead, obviously it's been promotional out there. Curious, just what kind of baked into your guidance on the promotion front. And then are there certain categories you're seeing more promotional activity? And then you mentioned that like you're still seeing high inventory levels across the marketplace. So curious if you have any view when maybe you think the marketplace will be a bit more clean.Doug Howe : Yeah. Good question. Yes, [indiscernible] done a really strong work with managing our margin and largely that is fueled by the fact that our inventory is in really good shape. So we didn't feel the need to get overly promotional. We are seeing the landscape improvement as we move through the back half, particularly in the athletic category. I think we'll start to see that inventory start to normalize, which hopefully will allow us to be less promotional. So we're saying very close to that. But as you said, it's a choppy macroeconomic environment out there. So we'll definitely stay close to it.Gaby Carbone : Great, thank you so much.Doug Howe : Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS. Please go ahead.Mauricio Serna : Great. Good morning. And thanks for taking our questions. First, I wanted to ask if you could provide maybe some color on what you see on quarter-to-date performance, in any particular segment versus Q2. And if we think about second half, should we see like any big difference between the sales growth in Q3 and Q4. Then just on the margins, you talked about SG&amp;A probably the SG&amp;A rate probably being a little bit more pressured because of the marketing and the launching of the website. So does that mean that SG&amp;A dollar growth will accelerate in the second half? Or how should we think about that? And then just lastly, on the balance sheet, very encouraging to see all the buyback continuing in Q3. Is there like a potential for even more given how there's also the higher leverage on the balance sheet at this point? Thank you.Doug Howe : Yeah. Thanks, Mauricio. This is Doug. There's a lot to unpack there. I think you had four questions. So I'll take the first two on the current performance and then Q3 and Q4, and I'll hand it over to Jared to speak to SG&amp;A and the balance of the year. As you know, we don't comment on sales in the current quarter. Having said that, we haven't seen anything that would lead us to change our guidance, which is why we're maintaining our outlook. We think about sales growth in Q3 and Q4 definitely a tailwind, we feel, certainly, as regard to we're up against softer comps in Q3 and most notably in Q4. Nice tailwinds are our fall campaign that we're going to be kicking off the DSW to really focus more on bringing awareness, which we're optimistic about.And then secondly, as we shared last quarter the return of Nike, we are very excited about continuing to elevate that partnership. So again those are two tailwinds. But again, as we navigate through choppy macroeconomic environment, we're balancing, obviously those tailwinds with those headwinds.Jared Poff : And I want to echo one thing that Doug had said to make sure it's clear, we've reiterated this a few times. In our current guidance, which we reaffirmed, we are assuming there is a pretty material change in the current trajectory that we've experienced year-to-date. That's always been the case, and we believe, especially as we get against easier comps, that is why we have belief. To date, we have not seen that, but we haven't planned to see that yet, but that is what is anticipated, but that is why we called out. There is certainly, I would say, a net risk position as it pertains to the macroeconomic conditions and turning -- seeing that turn to the degree that our current guidance has in there. But for now, it is on trend and that's why we've reaffirmed guidance.To your last two questions on the SG&amp;A, I'm actually very glad you spoke or asked about that because in my mind, right now, where the consensus modeling is probably most disconnected for the fall. I want to take you back to a moment to our initial guidance for SG&amp;A for the year. And what we had said was that we have done the reorg that we talked about and some cost savings initiatives that stripped about $25 million year-over-year out of our legacy business. But we also have about $50 million of SG&amp;A to add into the overall company because of Keds, Topo and the 53rd week. And right now, I'm not seeing consensus reflect that on a total year basis. In fact, it's looking like most consensus has that SG&amp;A dollars below LY [ph]. So I think that's one of the biggest disconnects that are currently out there in consensus.So that and the new interest within the loan. I want to call you back to that which I gave guidance to, if we look at a change in SG&amp;A dollars spring to fall, there's about a $40 million shift to kind of get to what I just talked about our full year guidance. That's coming from a few big buckets of work. One, we've got marketing. We shifted about $15 million of marketing across the company out of spring into fall as we were not seeing the traction or the incremental traction that we would have expected to see with that marketing. So we've moved that into fall. We use some of that for back-to-school. And we're very excited to be launching for the first in a long some DSW branding top of funnel marketing, very video heavy in the fall as well.So that shift has moved. We also have about $9 million of that 53rd week that's being added in there. So again, that's unique to fall, not happening in spring, and then about $4 million related to coming off the TSA with our Keds transition. That has always been the case. We just weren't sure when that was going to materialize that final month, we have a month of catch-up to do, and that happens to be in Q3. So all of that together, along with selling expenses related to an improvement in our comp performance totals about $40 million shift in SG&amp;A between fall versus spring and more in line with that total year guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, which I just want to make sure you guys are properly modeling. And then the last question was repurchases.Obviously, we have wanted to take advantage of what we think is a very opportunistic price. We funded that with term loan liquidity, and we've been executing. We did want to give, which we did cover in the current quarter because it was much heavier than even what we accomplished in the second quarter. And there is some remaining. We never commenced to future activities. So we quoted up through yesterday up to the fifth, but that's, I think, proof of how confident we feel in our long-term strategy.Mauricio Serna : Great. Thanks so much for all the details.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Dylan Carden with William Blair. Please go ahead.Dylan Carden : Thank you very much. Jared, just sticking with that last, the IRS refund, primary use of addition to that [ph] or how you think about that in full?Jared Poff : Yeah, the lion's share of it is on our revolving credit facility to adjust mechanically. As soon as that comes in that will immediately be used to pay that down. We will always assess as we always do current stock price versus liquidity and overall capacity to buy. So we aren't committing to deploy that in one particular fashion. And on day one it would be used to pay down our ABL debt. But there's no commitments or earmarked for those funds at this point.Dylan Carden : Okay. And then I just want to make sure I understand kind of the balance of guidance. So you have a lot of tailwinds between comparisons in Nike, et cetera. But if the consumer sort of takes a leg down here, would that be sort of detrimental to guidance at this point, just given some of the rhetoric on?Jared Poff : Yeah. So Dylan and you hit it on the head. As we look out for the year and how we built that guidance range, we are anticipating a pretty material shift in overall year-over-year performance than what we've experienced in the spring. That's always been the case, and that's what we've always communicated. And we do have some tailwinds and you hit them on the head. We've got easier comps. We've got Nike coming in. We've got some new branding advertising going on that I just talked about. So there certainly are tailwinds. At the end of the day, though, and we've been seeing it across the entire retail lens, especially people who sell to the consumer, the discretionary consumer, we're seeing a lot of caution. And right now, I call it -- I feel like we're in a net risk position even as it pertains to our current guidance. But it really lies square with that discretionary consumer and how they're feeling it going into fall.Dylan Carden : And the last one, we haven't talked about sort of the loyalty program in a while. I'm just kind of curious how these new brands interact with or essentially built on the back of the lower number that you had and how much of your sales would happen [indiscernible]? And anything part of retail?Doug Howe : Dylan, this is Doug. Again, we're pleased with the progress of the brands that we mentioned in the remarks, Keds and Topo Athletic. And then most recently Le TIGRE, very early days on, obviously. We're excited about that as we were the first launch partner at DSW, but we believe that there's opportunity to expand that outside of DBI channels of distribution, which is a broader opportunity as we move forward in general. So everything is performing to our expectations. We feel really good about that. And I think that just goes back to the strength of our business and the fact that we have the brand segment as well as the retail segment that we did realize those sales in our own channel. So just more confidence in the strategy that we're going to be deploying going forward.Jared Poff : The one thing I would add to that, Dylan, is -- and I mentioned it with our SG&amp;A, this month, we will be basically fully off that transition services agreement, actually a little ahead of schedule with Keds. So while, this has been a pretty transition late in the year for Keds, they've been performing at their acquisition model. We're really excited to have them now on our infrastructure for wholesale, for DTC and really excited about positioning them to start having strategic growth now that they're actually on our systems.Dylan Carden : Got it. And then just another one quick one here. Nike, can you just [technical difficulty] what the business was historically. But I think I'm right in sort of a new relationship with Nike to reengage this channel. How are you thinking about the scale of the pace of the dynamics of that relationship kind of on -- I think it launches this fourth quarter, right?Doug Howe : Yeah. Dylan, this is Doug. Again, we continue to be very optimistic about that integrated partnership with Nike. We actually are going to be delivering the product a little bit earlier than we originally anticipated, about a month earlier. We actually have some products available on our site, and we'll have a significant amount of units rolling out to our stores in the next couple of weeks. And again, that's about a month earlier than we had anticipated. So again, that is definitely a tailwind. So we feel good about that. We haven't shared specific with you with regards to how that brand would be. We shared obviously what it was historically, but we manage that very carefully as we manage all of our portfolio of brands. And it will really be informed obviously by what the customer is demanding and where we're seeing the top-line.Dylan Carden : Okay, that's all I got.Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Doug Howe for any final remarks.Doug Howe : Well, thanks everyone, for tuning in today, and I just want to reiterate thanks to our team for all their dedication as we move throughout very challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we move through the back half of the year next quarter. So thanks again.Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.]"

He was promptly replaced by Christopher Hufnagel, formerly president of the company.The move was swift, but praised by industry watchers, who regarded the appointment of the Wolverine veteran as a step in the right direction for the challenged parent company of Saucony, Merrell, Sperry and Sweaty Betty, among other brands.More from Footwear NewsCEO Talks: Arne Freundt Outlines His Vision for Puma's Next ChapterWWD x FN x Beauty Inc 50 Women in Power 2023As CEO, Hufnagel takes the reins of Wolverine’s broad turnaround effort to lead the footwear giant back to profitability. It’s no small task, but it’s also become the standard job description for new footwear CEOs in 2023.Since the start of the year, VF Corp., Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors, Under Armour, Adidas, Designer Brands, Converse, Pacsun, Kohl’s, Belk, Red Wing and more major footwear brands and retailers have ushered in a new top executive to their ranks. And that list grows wider — including firms like Foot Locker, Puma and Reebok — when the aperture is expanded to the last 12 months.These leaders are entering their roles in an unprecedented time for the footwear industry. The supply chain and pandemic-related issues of the last two years have now been replaced with a slew of other challenges — inflation, foreign exchange headwinds, an oversaturated North American athletic footwear market and cost-conscious consumers with little discretionary income to spend on shoes.“CEO jobs have always been challenging,” said Craig Rowley, a senior client partner in the consumer sector for consulting firm Korn Ferry. “[But] they’re probably as challenging and difficult as I’ve seen in my career.”As such, successful CEOs need a new set of qualities to get them through the fog. Namely, a clear vision, a strong sense for what the consumer wants and the ability to pivot quickly when the environment demands it.Story continuesSeeing around the cornerIn tandem with their CEO shifts, Wolverine, VF, Under Armour, Foot Locker and Adidas have all outlined different business transformation plans this year. These new leaders describe 2023 as a “reset” year, to set up their respective brands for long-term success with a focus on streamlining operations, cutting costs and elevating products.For example, as Mary Dillon approaches the one-year mark as CEO of Foot Locker, she told FN one of her top priorities is executing on Foot Locker’s transformation plan — or “Lace Up” strategy. In a recent interview, Dillon said it’s important for company leaders to have broader plans that drive “long-term, sustainable, profitable growth,” even if it takes longer to realize.Former executive chair and CEO of Ulta Beauty Mary Dillon came on board as Foot Locker’s new CEO in September.“Sometimes it takes a minute,” she said. “But at least in the long term, investing in the right places is critical for every business, because the world is changing rapidly.”But how did these companies — and CEOs — get to this point? According to Bobbie Lenga, who leads the global retail practice for leadership advisory firm Russell Reynolds, some of these problems can be chalked up to a general lack of foresight.“There are a lot of companies that are going through turnarounds and it’s not because the CEOs, in most cases, had done something so wrong,” said Lenga. “They just didn’t take action fast enough. This business moves so fast … there wasn’t enough innovation and there wasn’t enough transformation.”An effective retail chief needs a strong vision, or as Lenga put it, the ability to “see around corners.” Just short of predicting the future, retail CEOs need to arm themselves with consumer data and analytics to effectively evolve with consumer preferences.With an emphasis on turnaround experience, some boards have been looking outside the shoe industry and their own ranks to find their new CEOs.“Tenure in the industry is not as critical right now,” said Jaimee Marshall, managing partner of executive search firm Kirk Palmer Associates. “If you look across footwear, as well as retail, apparel and accessories, the sector has been troubled, and boards feel like the same old talent might not be the answer.”VF Corp. president and CEO Bracken Darrell Courtesy of VF Corp.For example, VF Corp. in June appointed Logitech International CEO and president Bracken Darrell as its new president and CEO. Analysts were overall positive on Darrell’s potential to turn the company around, despite his lack of experience in the retail and footwear space. And Stephanie Linnartz joined Under Armour as CEO in February after a 25-year stint in the hospitality industry, culminating in her role as president of Marriott International Inc. As for Dillon at Foot Locker, the bulk of her career was spent in the food industry before entering retail in 2013 as the head of Ulta Beauty.“If the board believes that their company’s current leadership does not yet have a vision for the future and they believe they need to go through dramatic change, the more likely it is they will hire someone completely outside the industry,” said Korn Ferry’s Rowley.Building strong brandsIn his first conference call as Wolverine’s CEO last month, Hufnagel outlined his topline goal: transforming the company into a true “builder of brands” by focusing on product innovation, consumer preferences and demand creation.But building up brand equity is no small feat right now, as the athletic footwear market, in particular, reels with too many products and not enough demand to sustain it.Following Hufnagel’s appointment, Williams Trading analyst Sam Poser wrote in a note to investors that Wolverine’s new chief should be careful not to go too hard, too fast. He further explained to FN that athletic brands need to control allocation in a more measured way, even though it may lead to short-term sales dips. This builds brand equity and keeps products desirable as opposed to omnipresent. “Managing brand sanctity drives long-term profitable growth,” Poser said. “[If] you do this, you grow better and more profitably.”In practice, this might require pulling back distribution across different channels to keep the consumer looking for more. “It looks like what Nike did with Jordan,” Poser said. “You allocate, you control.”For new leaders entering the sneaker industry, Poser said to take this approach: “It’s counterintuitive, [but] if you do less, you get more.”Beyond tracking demand, experts agree that for a CEO to be successful, he or she must have a strong sense for what consumers want. Where are they shopping? What products are making them tick? And where will they choose to cut back when their wallets get stretched?“It’s a matter of how you respond to what your customers are telling you, and how you make adjustments in your business,” said Lenga of Russell Reynolds. “You have to work fast.”Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's deep dive into VF Corp's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.What Does VF Corp Do?Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?VF Corp designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its apparel categories are active, outdoor, and work. Its portfolio of about a dozen brands includes Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF Corp markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company has grown through multiple acquisitions and traces its roots to 1899.VF Corp (VFC): A Closer Look at its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityA Glimpse at VF Corp's Dividend HistoryVF Corp has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1973. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. VF Corp has increased its dividend each year since 1973. The stock is thus listed as a dividend king, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 50 years.Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.VF Corp (VFC): A Closer Look at its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityBreaking Down VF Corp's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, VF Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 8.38% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 6.28%. This suggests an expectation of decrease dividend payments over the next 12 months.Story continuesOver the past three years, VF Corp's annual dividend growth rate was -1.60%. Based on VF Corp's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of VF Corp stock as of today is approximately 8.38%.VF Corp (VFC): A Closer Look at its Dividend Performance and SustainabilityThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, VF Corp's dividend payout ratio is 5.37, which may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.VF Corp's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks VF Corp's profitability 6 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 9 years out of past 10 years.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. VF Corp's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and VF Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. VF Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 4.50% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 55.71% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, VF Corp's earnings increased by approximately -41.80% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 9.65% of global competitors.ConclusionVF Corp's consistent dividend payment history, coupled with its status as a dividend king, make it a potential candidate for dividend-focused investors. However, its negative dividend growth rate and low payout ratio may raise concerns about the sustainability of its dividends. Furthermore, while the company has a fair growth outlook, its earnings growth rate is relatively low compared to global competitors. Therefore, investors should carefully consider these factors before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

With 84% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$5.0b last week after a 7.1% drop in the share price. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 40% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Zions Bancorporation National Association's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Zions Bancorporation National Association. View our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Zions Bancorporation National Association?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Zions Bancorporation National Association does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Zions Bancorporation National Association, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Zions Bancorporation National Association is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 14%. With 7.1% and 5.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Harris Simmons, the CEO has 0.9% of the shares allocated to their name.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Zions Bancorporation National AssociationThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Zions Bancorporation, National Association. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$82m. Most would see this as a real positive. It is good to see this level of investment by insiders. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Zions Bancorporation National Association is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this biggest U.S. mortgage lender have returned -7.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. The Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, to which Wells Fargo belongs, has lost 9.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Wells Fargo is expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share, indicating a change of -4.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 points to a change of +54.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.77 indicates a change of -1.4% from what Wells Fargo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Wells Fargo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.23 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $81.31 billion and $79.47 billion estimates indicate +10.2% and -2.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWells Fargo reported revenues of $20.53 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +20.6%. EPS of $1.25 for the same period compares with $0.74 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.28%. The EPS surprise was +8.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Wells Fargo is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Wells Fargo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The increase was primarily attributable to an improvement in net interest income, which was more than offset by the rise in provisions and non-interest expenses.Banks, with assets worth more than $10 billion, accounted for a major part of earnings in the June-ended quarter. Though such banks constitute only 3% of the total number of FDIC-insured institutes, these account for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Some of the notable names in this space are JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC.At present, JPMorgan sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.A rise in net operating revenues driven by growth in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income acted as a major tailwind. Also, higher interest rates and decent loan demand offered some support.Nonetheless, banks’ earnings were adversely impacted by higher provisions on expectations of a deteriorating operating backdrop. Further, a rise in non-interest expenses, higher funding costs and lower deposit balance were headwinds.Community banks, constituting 91% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported a net income of $7.1 billion, up almost 1% year over year.The return on average assets in second-quarter 2023 rose to 1.21% from 1.08% as of Jun 30, 2022.Net Operating Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseNet operating revenues came in at $252.5 billion, up 10.7% year over year.NII was $174.3 billion, increasing 15.4% year over year. Net interest margin (NIM) jumped 48 basis points (bps) to 3.28%, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25%. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also witnessed an increase in NIM.Non-interest income grew 1.7% to $78.2 billion.Total non-interest expenses were $141.9 billion, increasing 5.2%. The rise was mainly due to higher compensation expenses and “all other noninterest expense.”Despite the rise in expenses, the banking industry recorded a fall in efficiency ratio to 55.7% in the second quarter from 58.7% in the prior-year quarter. This was largely driven by “strong growth in net interest income.”Story continuesCredit Quality DeterioratingNet charge-offs (NCOs) for loans and leases were $14.7 billion, surging substantially year over year. NCO rate was 0.48% in the second quarter, up 25 bps from the prior-year quarter. The NCO rate is now equal to the pre-pandemic average.Provisions for credit losses were $21.5 billion during the second quarter, jumping 93.7% from the year-ago quarter. Several lenders, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, reported higher provisions.Loans Rise, Deposits FallAs of Jun 30, 2023, total loans and leases were $12.3 trillion, almost 1% up from the prior quarter. The rise was majorly attributable to higher credit card loan balances and “loans to nondepository financial institutions.”Total deposits amounted to $18.64 trillion, down marginally sequentially, mainly due to a 2.5% fall in uninsured deposits. This marked the fifth consecutive quarterly decline.  Unrealized losses on securities were $558.4 billion, up 8.3% from the prior quarter.As of Jun 30, 2023, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased nearly 1% from the March 2023 level to $117 billion. A rise in the DIF was largely driven by assessment income of $3.1 billion.One Bank Failure, Two New BanksDuring the reported quarter, one bank – First Republic Bank – failed. It was acquired by JPMorgan in a FDIC-assisted deal worth $10.6 billion.Further, two new banks were added, while 28 banks were absorbed following mergers.As of Jun 30, 2023, the number of ‘problem’ banks was 43. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions decreased to $46 billion from $58 billion reported in the first quarter of 2023.ConclusionThe FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, said, “The banking industry still faces significant challenges from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. These risks, combined with concerns about commercial real estate fundamentals, especially in office markets, as well as pressure on funding levels and net interest margins, will be matters of continued supervisory attention by the FDIC.”Though higher interest rates, decent loan demand and a changing revenue mix will offer much-needed support to banks’ top line, rising deposit costs will weigh substantially on it. This will likely lead to a contraction in net interest margins going forward. Also, a deteriorating macroeconomic environment is expected to hurt banks’ financials.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Previous trends in Apple stock may shed some light on the future of the company's performance. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre provides insights into Apple’s trading history in September.Video Transcript- And we've been talking a lot about Apple shares. They've been under pressure this week on reports that Chinese officials are asking government employees to stop using iPhones. Though Wall Street analysts are skeptical of the ban's long-term impact, 66% still have a buy rating on the stock.Wedbush's Dan Ives calling China concerns way overdone. But if history is to be believed, Apple's stock may have further to fall. And it's got nothing to do with China's rumored ban. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre, he's with us. He has been looking at the technicals. And what they show is pretty fascinating.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, it is. First of all, Apple, it's no surprise they're caught in a two-- actually, a three-day, I would say, loss here, even though we're up slightly today taking away some of those losses from the prior two days. Let's just take a look at what's happened this week.And then I'm gonna get into why September is the worst month to be invested in Apple. But first, here you can see down 5%. That's worth about $180, $190 billion, give or take $10 billion. So that means a lot. And let's just take a look at the three-month chart because a shot off the bow was this drop in here.If I put some candlesticks in, you can see this was one-day drop there. And this was a record high only a few days before. And as I was researching this, I found at the time that that speed, the speed of the drop there from a record high, never been done before. And when it does happen this way, for instance, when we fall from grace and get oversold pretty quickly, Apple stock does not recover quickly.Now, a separate technical study here. I went back to the beginning of Apple stock returns. They began the IPO in 1980. And so the first full year is 1981. I took the average from 1981 to 2022 each month of the year. And here's what it would look like if you were invested only for that one month. I have August through December here. August, the second best month there, second only to October. So October right around the corner.Story continuesWell, let me tell you something. September is the absolute worst month if you had $1,000 back in 1981 and you invested that only in the month of September, guess what. It would be worth now $80. So that's a loss of about 90%.Also, August is supposed to be a bumper month yet that did not materialize. So here's another way of looking at this, Apple stock returns by month. But this is a bar graph. We can see if you were invested in September, like I said, you'd be down 92%, August, up 637%, October, 750%.But why do I believe that may not be around the corner here this October? And that's because of the situation with Apple's declining revenues. And that is something that Sanford Bernstein has been talking about recently. And I think there's some merit to it. They're comparing apples performance from 2015 to what IBM did back in the day from 1997 to 2012.And this corresponds to this stock run up that you're seeing right here in IBM stock. What happened after that? Well, they had about 20 quarters of declining revenue. And the stock price took a hit. And over the last five years, it's not a disaster. But you can see it is just trading sideways here. So Apple, if it's gonna fall from grace, I don't think it's going away. But it might just become a slightly more boring company. We'll have to see.]"

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $10 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AES shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AES is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Bottom 42% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 49 cents per share to 48 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AES right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The company is focused on expanding its renewable footprint, which is expected to further drive its performance in the coming years.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face risks related to the trend of declining wholesale prices.TailwindsAES is at the forefront of the utility industry’s shift to clean energy through sustainable growth and innovation while delivering high-quality results. AES has expanded its development pipeline from 55 gigawatts (GW) as of January 2022, to 64 GW as of Dec 31, 2022. This expansion was achieved through acquisitions and higher investment in development activities.To rapidly expand its renewable footprint, both on the domestic front and in overseas markets, the company is investing aggressively. Through 2025, AES expects to invest a total of $4 billion in new renewables, generation, transmission, modernization and smart grid at its U.S. utilities.Currently, the generation capacity of the systems owned and/or operated under AES Clean Energy is 4,919 MW across the United States, with another 2,862 MW under construction, including 1,707 MW of solar, 639 MW of wind and 516 MW of energy storage. AES Clean Energy has a 5.2 GW backlog of projects, the majority of which are expected to come online through 2025. Based on expected growth in renewables, energy storage and U.S. utilities, the company expects its annualized growth in the range of 7-9% through 2025 and 6-8% through 2027.HeadwindsThe wholesale prices of electricity have declined significantly in recent years due to the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, cheap natural gas and demand-side management. This trend of declining wholesale prices is most likely to continue and might have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of AES.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Vistra Corp.

It’s either in or out,” BMW board member for sales &amp; marketing Pieter Nota said to Autocar. “We thought that we would provide an extra service to the customer by offering the chance to activate that later, but the user acceptance isn’t that high. People feel that they paid double — which was actually not true, but perception is reality, I always say.”Earlier this year BMW caused a massive stir when it introduced subscription pricing for heated seats in its cars, when the option wasn’t purchased originally. The rub here is the actual heated seat is built into most BMWs.Though this feature was only turned on in international regions and not the US, many BMW fans and auto enthusiasts were incensed at the prospect. The car comes with the feature built in — ""Why should buyers pay just to turn it on after the fact?"" was the most common complaint.The BMW i7 electric sedan. (Daniel Kraus) (BMW)Independent customer surveys also found this practice was off-putting to buyers. A study conducted by Cox Automotive in May found that 75% of respondents agreed with the statement that “features on demand will allow automakers to make more money,” and 69% of respondents said that if certain features were available only via subscription for a particular brand, they would likely shop elsewhere.BMW’s Nota did say however that the company would expand on its FoD or subscription pricing for certain software features like self-driving, driving aids, and infotainment options.Story continues“What we find is software-based services, like downloading a parking assist product, is very well accepted,” Nota said. “People know it’s a certain piece of software they can download that costs money. It’s the same as downloading a film or an extra feature on an app.”In a statement to Yahoo Finance, a BMW USA spokesperson reiterated that subscription features for heated seats was never an option for the US market, but added, ""We will continue to refine the Connected Drive offerings to make the latest technologies available to our customers and meet the demand in the markets.""Why subscription features are here to stayTesla was a pioneer in the space of utilizing subscription features (and collecting “connected” fees) for features on demand like Autopilot and the more advanced full-self-driving (FSD) beta feature. Now that many automakers have that success and modeled collecting subscription fees as new streams of revenue, the pressure is on to make those initiatives successful.“I don't think [features on demand] is going away, and also as the cars get more and more sophisticated, get more and more functionality, then it just feels like a natural progression,” Edmunds editor in chief Alistair Weaver told Yahoo Finance earlier this summer. “GM has been very open about it; Ford is working on it. So this is the new frontier of how to generate revenue.” In fact, GM has said it intends to pull in $20 billion to $25 billion in annual subscription revenue by 2030.One thing owners do like, however, is a free trial to see if they like a certain feature before plunking down a credit card. A survey conducted in July of this year by S&amp;P Global Mobility found that 82% of respondents who had experienced a free trial or existing subscription “would definitely or probably consider purchasing subscription-based services” on a future new car buy.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, the offer failed to meet the expectations of Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, who called the offer “insulting.”In its new contract, the legacy automaker offered a wage hike of 10% to roughly 46,000 of its UAW-represented workers. Newer or in-progression employees would be eligible for up to a 56% increase over the four years of the deal. Temporary workers would also receive a wage hike of 20%, which amounts to roughly $20 an hour.The UAW members start at about $18 an hour under the current pay regime and go through a “grow-in” period of four years to reach a top wage.General Motors’ new contract includes two additional 3% lump-sum payments, a $5,500 ratification bonus, a $6,000 one-time inflation-recognition payment, and $5,000 in inflation-protection bonuses over the life of the agreement, which in-progression employees are eligible to receive.Although the wage increase is the biggest hike the union has ever seen since 1999, it failed to meet the demands for a 40% hourly pay increase, a reduced 32-hour workweek, the elimination of compensation tiers, the restoration of cost-of-living adjustments, etc.Fain called the offer “insulting” because it comes nowhere near an equitable agreement for America’s autoworkers. Fain said either the automaker doesn’t care or isn’t listening to the union’s demand for economic justice. Fain asked the automaker to stop wasting its members’ time.GM came up with the proposal a week after the UAW filed unfair labor charges against it and its rival Stellantis N.V. STLA with the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”).The current UAW contract with GM, Ford Motor F and Stellantis will expire after 11:59 p.m. on Sep 14, 2023. Stellantis plans to make a counteroffer to the UAW this week.Last week, Ford offered 15% guaranteed combined wage increases, lump sums and enhanced benefits over the life of the contract. However, that offer also did not go down well with Fain.Nearly 97% of UAW members from GM, Ford and Stellantis voted in favor of authorizing a strike against the Detroit Three automakers if an agreement is not reached prior to the expiration of their current four-year contract.During the last strike in 2019, General Motors sustained a production loss of 300,000 vehicles and lost $3.6 billion in earnings.

The spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful product company has outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, which dropped 0.9% in the same period.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been benefiting from its brand strength, prudent acquisitions and efficient saving programs. Solid marketing and innovative initiatives have been working well for McCormick. Encouragingly, MKC raised its adjusted operating income and earnings per share view for fiscal 2023 when it reported strong second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein earnings and sales increased year over year, and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For fiscal 2023, the adjusted operating income is likely to grow 10-12% now, up from the prior guidance of 9-11% growth. Management envisions fiscal adjusted EPS in the band of $2.60-$2.65 compared with the earlier view of $2.56-$2.61. The bottom-line view suggests growth from $2.53 recorded in fiscal 2022.Net sales are still expected to increase 5-7%, fueled by pricing actions. The company anticipates seeing solid growth via brand strength, brand marketing, new products, category management and differentiated customer engagement.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Working Well for McCormickMcCormick has fortified its presence through acquisitions. In December 2020, MKC bought 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories.In November 2020, McCormick also completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce, a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. The buyout of Cholula accelerates MKC’s growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.Further, the company's acquisition of the food division of RB Foods (concluded in August 2017) is noteworthy. Some of the other noteworthy acquisitions of McCormick are Italy-based Enrico GiottiSpA (December 2016) as well as Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016).McCormick is focused on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program helped the company reduce costs and enhance productivity.The company has used CCI savings to increase investments, thereby leading to higher sales and profits. MKC’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 adjusted gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points due to efficient pricing, an improved product mix and cost savings from the CCI and Global Operating Effectiveness (""GOE"") programs.The GOE program aims at optimizing MKC’s supply chain and cost structure. McCormick expects savings from its GOE program to scale up as fiscal 2023 progresses. It expects savings from the GOE program to have an 800-basis point impact on adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2023. Savings from the CCI program are likely to be $85 million in fiscal 2023. Such cost savings, coupled with effective pricing actions, are likely to continue enhancing the company’s profits in the future.Story continuesOther Solid Consumer Staple BetsInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Here are 2 stocks he’s using to bet on a bounce",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/don-t-fooled-ken-fisher-131744135.html,1694179064.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'SCHW']","[Ken FisherThe best investors will often tell you that one vital ingredient for stock market success is an overlooked and underappreciated one: patience.With this year’s bull market appearing to stall, billionaire stock picker Ken Fisher reminds investors that it’s a quality needed to weather the more difficult periods, which are also a natural component of any bull market.“Volatility isn’t a flaw in this bull market. It is a feature of all bull markets, which proverbially climb a ‘Wall of Worry,’” the Fisher Investments founder recently said. “The bull market born last October should keep delivering worthy returns, but sporadically. Reaping them requires patience, which can be difficult for some.”But sticking with it is Fisher’s advice: “Don’t be fooled – this bull market has legs, and it is crucial you don’t get scared of it now.”Fisher has decades of stock market success behind him and has a net worth of $7.1 billion, so he most definitely knows what he’s talking about here. For investors looking to get ahead in the market, it’s worth finding out which stocks he’s patiently counting on to bring the goods once the upward curve resumes.We’ve started this process and have taken a look at a pair of equities that make up a meaningful chunk of Fisher’s portfolio – both holdings exceed $1 billion in value. But it’s not only Fisher showing big faith in these names; according to the TipRanks database, the analyst consensus rates both as Strong Buys. Let’s see what makes them so.Charles Schwab (SCHW)Fisher holds a big position in one of the most prominent companies in the investing world. Charles Schwab is a brokerage firm that has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of online investing and financial services. Founded in 1971 by Charles R. Schwab, it has grown to become one of the largest and most respected financial institutions in the US.The company offers a wide range of services, including stock and bond trading, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), retirement accounts, and wealth management services. Charles Schwab provides a user-friendly and technologically advanced platform for investors and was a pioneer in introducing online trading, which revolutionized the way individuals manage their investments. With a market cap over $106 billion, the company is the U.S.’s biggest publicly traded investment services firm, with ~$8 trillion in client assets.Story continuesThat said, 2023 has been no easy ride, especially earlier in the year when the stock got caught up in the fallout of several prominent bank collapses. The shares went through an almost 40% drop between January and early March. The stock has bounced back a bit since, aided by a better-than-expected Q2 print. While revenue fell by 8.4% year-over-year to $4.66 billion, the figure exceeded Street expectations by $50 million. Likewise, adj. EPS of $0.75 beat the consensus estimate by $0.04.Meanwhile, Fisher must have sensed the pullback offers an opportunity to load up. He bought 1,302,697 shares in Q2, upping his SCHW stake by 8%. His total holdings now stand at more than 18 million shares, currently worth ~$1.04 billion.Assessing the company’s prospects, Piper Sandler analyst Patrick Moley thinks the future looks bright for this financial giant.“While eBrokers typically fall out of investor favor at the end of rate hiking cycles, the unprecedented pace of rate hikes this cycle provides a unique opportunity for NIM expansion and earnings growth even if the Fed starts cutting,” Moley explained. “In our view, SCHW remains a ’24/’25 story as (1) a return of deposit growth, (2) the paydown of temporary ST funding, (3) NIM expansion, and (4) the realization of AMTD integration synergies and incremental expense saves converge to produce strong earnings power and an attractive valuation for LT investors into this industry leading financial services franchise.”As such, Moley rates SCHW shares as Overweight (i.e., Buy), with an $86 price target, indicating potential for ~49% growth over the coming year. (To watch Moley’s track record, click here)Most on the Street agree with Moley’s take. Based on 13 Buys, 2 Holds and 1 Sell, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. At $73.80, the average target points to 12-month upside of 28%. (See SCHW stock forecast)Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Patience might be one quality investors should adhere to, but diversification is often seen as another. And in that sense, it is fitting that the next Fisher-backed stock we’ll look at is of an entirely different hue. Fisher holds 4,444,151 shares of medical device maker Intuitive Surgical. These command a market value of more than $1.32 billion.In one way, Intuitive Surgical is similar to Charles Schwab above – it is also a pioneer in its field. It is a healthcare tech company that has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgery. The Sunnyvale, California-based firm is best known for its da Vinci Surgical System, a groundbreaking robotic surgical platform. The da Vinci System enables surgeons to perform complex surgical procedures with enhanced precision, dexterity, and control through minimally invasive techniques. This innovative technology has found applications in various medical specialties, including urology, gynecology, general surgery, and cardiothoracic surgery, making it a vital tool in modern healthcare.Its usage is on the up, too. In the most recently reported quarter, for 2Q23, worldwide da Vinci procedures increased by around 22% compared to the same period last year while the company placed 331 systems, vs. the 279 placed in 2Q22. As of the end of the quarter, the installed base stood at 8,042 systems, representing a 13% year-over-year uptick.These activities led to outperformance in both the top and bottom lines. Q2 revenue climbed by 15.8% year-over-year to $1.76 billion, edging ahead of Street expectations by $20 million, while adjusted EPS of $1.42 beat the forecast by $0.09.Piper Sandler analyst Adam Maeder has been keeping a tab on ISRG’s progress and he points out a specific opportunity that might be somewhat underappreciated.“We recently took a renewed look at the China opportunity for Intuitive, which we believe is quite sizable in the coming years,” the 5-star analyst noted. “Not only will ISRG likely place a substantial amount of systems under the new quota, da Vincis in China are some of the highest utilized systems in the world—which should also bode well for procedure growth. Our math suggests that system placements from the new quota coupled with robust procedure volume from a growing install base should result in nicely accretive growth in 2023-2027. We believe ISRG’s China revenue could more-than-double from ~ $300M in 2023 (our estimate) to roughly $650M in 2027. While the Street views China to be an important growth contributor, we do not believe models are fully incorporating the magnitude of this potential growth lever.”These comments underpin Maeder’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating while his $385 price target implies shares will appreciate by ~30% over the next year. (To watch Maeder’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, most other analysts are on the same page. With 12 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that ISRG is a Strong Buy. Additionally, the $377.14 average price target brings the upside potential to ~27%.

The companies escalating operating costs are affecting profits. A debt-laden balance sheet induces a rise in interest expenses. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.Nevertheless, Humana's Medicaid business benefits from several contract wins and renewals thereby contributing to the top line. Strategic buyouts and alliances place it well for growth in the future.Solid contributions from the Insurance and CenterWell segments bode well. Management estimates adjusted 2023 EPS to be at least $28.25, reflecting minimum growth of 12% year over year.

The company's focus on enhancement of its product portfolio holds promise. Cintas' efforts to reward shareholders are impressive.However, the rising cost of sales, and increasing selling and administrative expenses pose a threat to the company's bottom line.

KR came up with second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined year over year. Nonetheless, the bottom line surpassed the consensus mark and improved from the year-ago period. The company also registered growth in identical sales without fuel. However, the growth rate decelerated on a sequential basis.Kroger appears to be navigating a tough operating environment. Factors such as inflation, reduced SNAP benefits and the current economic backdrop, particularly a higher-interest-rate scenario, have posed challenges, predominantly for budget-conscious consumers.Despite these headwinds, Kroger's well-defined customer segmentation strategy, emphasis on value and focus on its 'Our Brands' portfolio have provided some cushion. The company remains committed to its core strengths, including an array of fresh products, personalized shopping experiences and a seamless digital ecosystem, all aimed at sustaining its momentum.In a separate release, Kroger revealed that it has entered into a definitive agreement alongside Albertsons with C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers for the sale of 413 stores, eight distribution centers, two offices and five private-label brands in connection with their proposed merger announced in October last year.Analyzing Q2 OutcomeKroger posted adjusted earnings of 96 cents a share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and increased from the 90 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Including a $1.4 billion charge related to a nationwide opioid settlement framework, the company reported a loss of 25 cents a share.The Kroger Co. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Kroger Co. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseThe Kroger Co. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Kroger Co. QuoteTotal sales of $33,853 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $34,251 million. The metric also declined from the $34,638 million reported in the year-ago period. Excluding fuel, sales rose 1.1% from the year-ago period. We note that identical sales, without fuel, jumped 1%, following 3.5% growth registered in the preceding quarter. Digital sales grew 12% during the quarter under discussion.We note that the gross margin was 21.8% of sales. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, expanded 35 basis points compared to the same period last year. The adjusted FIFO operating profit came in at $989 million, down from the $1,110 million reported in the year-ago period.Story continuesOther Financial AspectsKroger ended the quarter with cash of $263 million, total debt of $12,791 million and shareowners’ equity of $10,604 million. Net total debt decreased by $1,792 million over the last four quarters. Management estimates capital expenditures in the band of $3.4-$3.6 billion and expects to generate adjusted free cash flow between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion in fiscal 2023.2023 ViewManagement reaffirmed its financial outlook for fiscal 2023. Kroger envisions identical sales, without fuel, to rise 1% to 2% in the current fiscal, with underlying growth of 2.5% to 3.5% after adjusting for the effect of Express Scripts. Management believes that the environment will remain challenging for consumers. Consequently, it anticipates identical sales, without fuel, to land at the lower end of the projected range, turning marginally negative in the second half of the year.Kroger anticipates the adjusted FIFO operating profit in the band of $5-$5.2 billion compared with $5.1 billion reported in fiscal 2022. The company anticipates fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings between $4.45 and $4.60 per share, suggesting an increase from adjusted earnings of $4.23 reported in fiscal 2022.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have fallen 1.4% in the past three months against the industry’s rise of 5.9%.Bet Your Bucks on These 3 Hot StocksHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Grocery Outlet GO, Ross Stores ROST and Walmart WMT.Grocery Outlet, an extreme value retailer of quality, name-brand consumables and fresh products, currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Last month, U.S. stock markets faced major setbacks for the first time in 2023. Market participants remain worried about how markets will behave this month. September is historically the worst-performing month on Wall Street. U.S. stocks have witnessed volatile trading in the first week of this month.The Fed’s September FOMC meeting will be the key focal point this month in the absence of earnings results. Crude oil prices spiked on Sep 5, following the decision of Saudi Arabia to extend its daily production cut decision until the end of 2023. Investors are concerned that higher crude oil prices will result in higher inflation. Higher oil prices will directly affect the transportation sector, which in turn will raise the general price level. This will make the task of the Fed more difficult for a soft landing of the U.S. economy.Moreover, on Aug 6, the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note rose 2 basis points to 4.292%. The yield on the short-term 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note jumped 10 basis points to 5.02%. This yield is loosely linked to interest rate movement. The yield on the long-term 30-Year U.S. Treasury Note climbed 14 basis points to 4.373%. The ICE U.S. dollar Index rose to a six-month high at 104.90. A higher risk-free market interest rate is detrimental to growth stocks like technology, consumer discretionary and cryptocurrencies.As a result, prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) remained rangebound. Cryptocurrencies may face volatility in the near-term as the Fed has already warned that a further hike in interest rate is possible as the inflation rate is currently more than double that of the central bank’s 2% target rate.Stocks to WatchVisa Inc. V is taking a significant step toward modernizing cross-border money movement.

Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA) is one such stock that warrants attention. Currently priced at $11.31, Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) recorded a daily loss of 8.54% and a 3-month increase of 16.35%. According to its GF Value, the stock's fair valuation stands at $23.56.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with MARA. Click here to check it out. MARA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MARAThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock, derived from a unique method. The GF Value Line on the summary page provides an overview of the stock's fair value. This value is calculated based on historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.The GF Value Line indicates the fair value at which the stock should be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationConsidering the RisksDespite Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MARA)'s seemingly attractive valuation, it's crucial to consider certain risk factors associated with the company. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of -0.01. These indicators suggest that Marathon Digital Holdings, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underscores the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model created by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968. It predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesCompany SnapshotMarathon Digital Holdings focuses on mining digital assets. It owns cryptocurrency mining machines and a data center to mine digital assets. The company currently operates in the Digital Currency Blockchain segment. Its cryptocurrency machines are located in the United States. Despite the promising business model, the company's financial health may be weak, as suggested by its low Altman Z-Score.Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA): A Smart Investment or a Value Trap? An In-Depth ExplorationDissecting Marathon Digital Holdings's Low Altman Z-ScoreA closer look at Marathon Digital Holdings's Altman Z-score reveals potential financial distress. The Working Capital to Total Assets ratio, a measure of short-term liquidity, has been declining over the past few years (2021: 0.01; 2022: 0.00; 2023: 0.00). This decline suggests potential liquidity issues that the company may be facing. Additionally, the EBIT to Total Assets ratio (2021: -0.06; 2022: -0.13; 2023: -0.38) indicates that Marathon Digital Holdings might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap?Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, Marathon Digital Holdings might be a potential value trap, considering its low Altman Z-Score and other risk factors. This underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.

Let’s take a look at Marriott International’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Marriott International Is Marriott International Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Marriott International today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $228.27, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Marriott International’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Marriott International generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Marriott International's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MAR’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MAR, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

And these are not just jobs lost, but it’s insight lost. And so it’s important that all media companies understand the impact, but also, it’s incumbent on the big AI players to understand their impact.”While warnings about AI job losses are not limited to newsrooms, Thomson warned that there was a greater societal risk: that we will become deluged by a stream of AI-generated “rubbish”.“People have to understand that AI is essentially retrospective. It’s about permutations of pre-existing content. And the danger is, it’s rubbish in, rubbish out, and in this case, rubbish all about,” Thomson said.“Instead of elevating and enhancing, what you might find is that you have this ever shrinking cycle of sanity surrounded by a reservoir of rubbish. That instead of the insight that AI can potentially bring, it will evolve into essentially a maggot-ridden mind mould.”Concerns about technology are not new. Rupert Murdoch has spent much of the last decade and a half at war with Google, claiming the internet giant has been ripping off his content.The Australian media tycoon has called the search engine a “parasite” and “kleptomaniac”, accusing it of stealing work from a newspaper empire that includes The Times, The Sun, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.Rupert Murdoch has clashed with Google for over a decade over the tech giants usage of News Corp content - Victoria Jones/PA WireMurdoch briefly went so far as to block Google from including The Times within its search results. His company, News Corporation, complained to the European Commission, accusing Google of exploiting “a dominant market position to stifle competition”.Story continuesHis hard line has seen results:  Australia, where Murdoch retains a lasting influence, introduced pioneering laws that effectively make Google and Facebook pay for news in 2021.After a stand-off, Google backed down, striking deals with dozens of outlets. Now, countries around the world are following, and News Corp and Google have signed a multi-year partnership deal that involves “significant payments” from the tech company.While AI now poses a fresh threat, there is also an opportunity.Mr Thomson told shareholders last month that it would allow the company to reduce costs. He has suggested that this will be in back office functions, although the company’s local Australian titles are already using AI to author stories about weather and fuel prices.Murdoch’s loudest critics would find it ironic that Thomson is complaining about AI poisoning people’s minds. But most would concede that he has a point.While chatbots such as ChatGPT can appear omniscient, at a fundamental level they are simply consuming and repackaging huge quantities of existing knowledge that they have already ingested. Creating that knowledge is another matter altogether.Major news sites such as the New York Times, Reuters and CNN have already begun blocking ChatGPT software that scours the web for material to ingest.That may only be an initial step. The New York Times is reportedly considering legal action against OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT as negotiations between the companies over a licensing deal fail to bear fruit.In July, The Telegraph revealed that DMGT, the owner of the Daily Mail, was considering potential action against Google for using its online articles to train its ChatGPT competitor, Bard.News Corp, despite Murdoch’s previous fiery past rhetoric against Google, has been less confrontational.“What you will see over time, [is] a lot of litigation,” Thomson said. “Some media companies have already begun those discussions. Personally, we’re not interested in that at this stage. We’re much more interested in negotiation, and we have various negotiations going on.”News organisations including the Associated Press have already agreed deals with OpenAI.However, Thomson is likely to strike a hard bargain. His critique is not only that AI companies are scraping huge quantities of copyrighted data, but that it is producing biased content that is corrosive to society.Woke chatbotThomson has complained about what he sees as AI programmes “churning out… left wing” articles.In a separate talk, he added: “It really is incumbent on these companies to recognise that responsibility in the end to their own products and certainly, to society.”These comments may be directed at regulators.Britain’s Intellectual Property Office, among others, is currently assessing how copyright laws apply to AI.Murdoch’s fight with search engines may have reached a truce.

For us, it actually starts to unleash unique data. We are the local knowledge graph. So I think the value of what we do starts to really shine forth. We're the only platform where you're finding out what's going on around you locally in real time.So with that data, we can do things like on the platform help a neighbor compose a post in a way that is more engaging. So the assistant or the AI actually does that for you.KELLY STECKELBERG: There's lots of interesting discussions we can have around AI. So we announced just this morning, Zoom AI companion, which is our answer to how generative AI is going to be included in our platform.And there's all kinds of really cool features that come with that for our paid subscribers. There are things like chat compose, if you're in the chat thread and you want to be able to respond to that. There are things like meeting summaries, which, after the fact, help categorize and capture not only what happened in the meeting, but also the true sentiment.CHRIS COCKS: I think any creative would admit that AI is transformative to how they think about and how they concept new ideas.

And it impacts not only the products, but it impacts how software is created.ROBERT THOMSON: There certainly needs to be a lot of debate about AI and journalism. 57% of newsroom jobs in the United States have been lost. We're facing another wave, in this case, a tsunami potentially of job losses because of the impact of AI. And these are not just jobs lost, but it's inside lost.

An Intuit Assist is really a personalized intelligent assistant in your pocket. It's also powered by AI-driven human experts. So that when you are getting assistance from Intuit Assist, if you ever need to talk to an expert, no matter what it is that you're doing, you're able to do that. So there's always a gateway to help.GEORGE ARISON: AI is going to change this whole industry completely. And so we're thinking a lot about how do we use AI to match people a lot better and to support the conversations that are happening.I think conversational AI is also a big opportunity because people do produce all these messages. So helping them craft those messages, make it easier to communicate, I think, is something people will really appreciate as well.]"

Federated Hermes Chief Equity Strategist Phil Orlando joins Yahoo Finance Live to share his outlook on tech valuations obstructing growth in other sectors.""Nvidia is sort of the poster child of this imbalance,"" Orlando explains, adding: ""The stock has gone up by a multiple of five times [since October]. From a valuation perspective. they're trading at something like 40 times forward revenues and 130 times forward earnings. That, in our view, is excessive, and it's reminiscent of what the tech stocks did in that fourth quarter of 1999 as we were going into the Y2K calendar changeover.""Orlando notes valuation shifts could open up opportunities for value and small-cap stocks.Video Transcript- When it comes to tech, though, we have seen some losses. But are we headed for an even larger correction ahead?PHIL ORLANDO: I think the answer is yes. First of all, thank you very much for having me. One of the things that we've been focused on has been the significant divergence between the performance of these big eight technology companies and the rest of the market over the balance of this year. Now, the stocks I'm talking about are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, et cetera. These eight stocks collectively account for 28% of the weight of the S&amp;P 500.Now, the first half of the year has been terrific for the S&amp;P, you're up about 20%. These eight stocks, these technology names, collectively, are up by 65% in the first seven months of the year. How are the other 492 companies doing in the S&amp;P 500? There up about 7%.So we think there's a significant divergence that's been created from a valuation perspective. I'll just give you one example-- Nvidia is the poster child of this imbalance. From the bottom of the market last October to where Nvidia's peaked out over the course of the last month or so, the stock has gone up by a multiple of five times. From a valuation perspective, they're trading at something like 40 times forward revenues and 130 times forward earnings. That, in our view, is excessive and it's reminiscent of what the tech stocks did in that fourth quarter of 1999 as we were going into the Y2K calendar changeover.Story continuesSo we've been expecting that the technology stocks would have some profit taking in this August, September, October time frame. You've seen some sloppiness over the course of the last couple of weeks or so. We think this continues over the next few weeks and next few months. And in the meantime, we think some of the value stocks, and small cap stocks, and international stocks are probably going to feel some love.- So, Phil, you talk about profit taking. Let's look at one of those names that we just had up on the screen there, Apple. We have seen some declines on the back of those headlines coming out of China. There's an argument to be made, whether that the sell off we saw over the last few days, although a bit of a bounce back today, how much of that is overdone. Are you concerned that a headline like that could really start to unravel some of this tech trade? Or is this just an overreaction in a very jittery market?PHIL ORLANDO: Well, look, the reality is these stocks have done phenomenally well since the bottom of the market last October and the first seven months of this year. So given where we are in the calendar and given how excessive valuations are, investors are looking for some justification to lock in profits. And certainly, the news out of China with regard to Apple and the concerns about how well or how poorly this new product transition is going to go-- I guess they've got a new phone they're going to announce on September 12-- some investors saying, you know what, let's take some chips off the table let's play with the house's money. And so that's a perfectly rational viewpoint for a lot of investors.Now, is this a phenomenon that just lasts for a couple of days? Our best guess is that this phenomenon could last for a couple of months.The August, September, October period, historically, is a choppy one. This is the sort of thing we see every year. The fundamental setup is very similar to what we've seen in the past. So we went into this period thinking cautiously about domestic large cap growth and technology in particular, we're underweight those categories, and this is the reason.We do think they'll pull back, not that these are bad companies. Look, Apple is a phenomenal company. [INAUDIBLE] and NVIDIA are phenomenal companies. but I'd love to get back in overweight a little later in the cycle at much cheaper prices.]"
217,e3bc89ed-38a8-3b6e-83e3-b84364b2ad60,NVDA,2023-09-09,7 AI Secrets Every Investor Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-ai-secrets-every-investor-183600426.html,1694198160,STORY,['NVDA'],"[One of the most common questions I get from investors about Artificial Intelligence (AI) this year is… “If it’s all just about ChatGPT, what stocks can I buy besides NVIDIA?”It’s a valid concern. Just because we hear that a $20 trillion economic tsunami of exponential innovation is exploding over the next five years, doesn’t mean that we can readily see how that huge blast filters out of the technology sector and into hundreds of other industries. Or that this might easily create wealth for savvy investors.ChatGPT... It’s Just a Fun Toy, Right? ChatGPT may be the “chatterbot” that ate the internet, but most still underestimate the AI impact on nearly every industry.I was predicting in 2022 -- when I scooped NVDA shares under $125 -- that something would eventually come along to make people see how powerful the AI revolution was. And when it showed up, I wrote a special report about ChatGPT to explain why another “iPhone moment” was upon us.Since then, I think it’s all unfolding right now in massive surprising demand for the tools of AI that are called “massively parallel architectures.” And there’s still time to get on that wave for a ride that will last several years.So it’s a good idea to review the major forces driving the AI tsunami that allowed NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang to predict a $250 billion per year transformation… as global enterprises shift to accelerated hyperscale computing that only comes from GPU (graphics processing unit) systems.The Data Deluge Has Grown Exponentially It has been estimated by data-focused companies like Splunk that over 50% of corporate data is “in the dark.” It’s not seen, used, or capitalized on.That’s because every Global 2000 company is collecting terabytes of log files every day that most never knew how to use even a year ago.But what used to be a black hole of infinite gravity and compression has now become a gold mine of possibility.When NVIDIA announced in May that it would not only beat its prior Q2 revenue guidance by $4 billion but that it was launching its latest GPU system, the DGX GH200 -- that was 50% faster than the prior generation -- the stock launched above $350 and never looked down again.I told investors throughout June and July that NVIDIA would beat even their most optimistic forecasts for sales and easily top the $12 billion guidance for this current quarter that began in August. They guided to $16 billion.Why did this happen?I think the biggest preview of this catalyst was that the company was also able to share in May that its first three customers already in line were Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. This was the spark that made hundreds of other global enterprises realize they need to upgrade their datacenter infrastructure -- or else.7 Secrets of the AI RevolutionSo what exactly is it that major enterprises across every sector, from manufacturing and energy to healthcare and retail, want to accomplish with all their data?Continued . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Zacks Reveals ChatGPT “Sleeper Stock” One little-known company is at the heart of an especially brilliant Artificial Intelligence sector. By 2030, AI could expand the global economy by $15.7T. That’s internet and iPhone-scale impact.ChatGPT answers follow up questions … admits mistakes … challenges incorrect premises … and even rejects inappropriate requests. This phenomenon is already outpacing the adoption rates of TikTok and Instagram by 3X and 10X respectively.Zacks has released a Special Report that uncovers a stock hiding under Wall Street radar, plus 4 other must-buys. Distribution of the report is limited.Download Now &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are many areas where machine learning and deep learning, the two primary galaxies of AI, can be applied to the dark data deluge. But here are 7 major categories that I think capture the goals of the modern enterprise.1) Model Once data is no longer dark but accessible and able to be “mined,” it can be used in millions of ways to model how a company thrives (or not) within its industry.This is the early stage of awareness and idea generation. We have moved beyond “data processing” to data analytics that reveals new insights. What does our data tell us over any given period?2) Forecast Just like weather modeling has become a fantastically efficient and adaptive set of systems, any enterprise can take models and apply them to their business and industry for new predictions and insights.When an organization can experiment with data and forecasts, it opens up a part of the human brain that thinks in multiple scenarios and outcomes. Because AI is just a powertool and it still requires people who know how to strategically apply its deep analysis. Corporations are starting to think of AI as a “second brain” for decision making. And this is essential to thriving in a hyper-speed economy.3) Visualize Not every manager wants to stare at spreadsheets all day to understand what’s going on in their business. And especially when they need to communicate with a wide diversity of stakeholders -- from investors to entry-level employees -- they know that a picture can be worth 10,000 words.That’s where visualizations of data can make the difference between a lost message and a grand slam presentation about company initiatives. The latest AI tools in the hands of the most innovative SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies make this kind of “data-come-to-life” possible in millions of enlightening and persuasive ways.4) Simulate Engineering teams from the auto and aircraft plants to the medical device maker can create system and product designs and fully test them in simulated virtual environments with billions of trials and random errors. This ensures high degrees of both efficacy and safety before they send anything to the factory or biotech manufacturing floor.This is how BMW used NVIDIA platforms to create “digital twin” factories to test their robotic systems before they built them. And it’s how NASA engineers design missions and spacecraft before they forge a single part, whether from a special alloy or 3-D printed composite. It’s also how every major company can use metaverse tools to simulate their products, processes, and customer experience.5) Automate Once a machine learning algorithm has been designed to process data and perform specific functions in real-time, a host of efficiency is bestowed on that company. Some fear that this automation ends up eliminating jobs, but actually it frees up employees to do more creative humans-only kind of work that advances company goals.When a company or municipality can use predictive analytics to give them early intel about when a machine, system, traffic, supply, demand, infrastructure, or pricing element might shift or break down, they have real-time analytics to investigate and respond proactively.6) Innovate When data is harnessed in the above 5 ways, it unleashes the creativity of that organization. So much R&amp;D can be made more efficient -- and 1,000 times faster -- to give employees the knowledge, insights and tools to imagine even bigger goals. This speed of intel gives them the time, talent, and optimism to create the future.7) Solve My last secret is primarily about the world of science where thousands of curious, experimenting minds are looking to expand genomics research, create new materials and energy for earth and space, study climate change at advanced levels, and diagnose and treat cancer and other genetic or neurological diseases at the earliest stages.I don’t know if Jensen Huang would admit that his favorite “secret” here is the solving of vast scientific problems. But I know from following his every word for the past 7 years that this one ranks pretty high for him. He’s like a boy building toys for every exploration.The Age of Exponential Innovation Moore’s Law was a real force in computing for the past 5 decades, as semiconductor technology grew ever faster, better, cheaper -- and smaller. But the rate of progress started to slow in the 2010s.That’s when Jensen Huang predicted over a decade ago that accelerated GPU computing -- driven by advanced software algorithms -- would change the world by reigniting Moore’s Law into another exponential phase. We have just entered that arena.Path to World-Changing Profits Today I invite you to download my Special Report on an especially brilliant sector of Artificial Intelligence: ChatGPT: 5 Stocks for the Predicted $15.7T AI Boom.

The intellectual property hoard is impressive, but the timing is strange. Could this be a marketing push to attract interest in the U.S. business for which it is “exploring strategic alternatives”?The San Diego-based company has amassed 591 patents in autonomous trucking, including 72 granted globally since the beginning of the year. In a blog post on LinkedIn, the 8-year-old startup says it is focusing on practical solutions to the complex challenges required to bring autonomous semi trucks to market.A news release Thursday highlighting fourth-quarter financial results and the filing of its Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K for 2022, prominently mentions TuSimple’s core technology patents and intellectual property:ADS onboard software: perception, tracking and fusion; prediction and planning; and control modules.Core AI and data: data collection, deep learning and machine learning capabilities.ADS hardware solutions: sensors, actuators, communications and ADC.Offboard toolchain: map production, simulation and regeneration.AV operations: oversight, commercial operations, safety and integration.In a video and blog post, this chart breaks down how those patents are allocated.TuSimple’s 591 patents are spread across its autonomous trucking efforts.

Plus has 438 awarded and pending patents worldwide. Torc Robotics does not disclose patent information and Waymo did not respond to an emailed inquiry.Cummins CEO Jennifer Rumsey discusses battery cell partnershipWednesday’s announcement of a planned joint venture by Cummins Inc., Daimler Truck and Paccar Inc. to make lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in the U.S. broke some new ground in the trucking industry’s approach to its supply chain.Working with a lesser-known Chinese battery technology company has advantages. The know-how could help create a local supply chain that should be easier to manage. And it should reduce worries about  whether China will lock down exports of rare earth materials like cobalt and nickel.Jennifer Rumsey, Cummins chair and CEO, and I talked about the potential for the partnership. The Q&amp;A is edited for clarity and length.Truck Tech: Who came up with the idea of a joint venture?Rumsey: Paccar, Daimler Truck and Cummins all saw this opportunity and had an interest in coming together on this particular chemistry, LFP, to create a plan and share that investment because together we think we can create scale for a cell that will be uniquely suited for commercial vehicles. Paccar and Daimler can use that cell and the packs that they create for their trucks and Cummins can sell to other customers in commercial vehicle and industrial applications.Truck Tech: When do you expect your production site to be announced and where would you expect that to be?Rumsey: It’s going to take some time for us to hire the team and build the plant. Our plan is to start production in 2027 and scale up between the 2027 and 2030 time frame to that 21-gigawatt hour number.Truck Tech: This is not a small amount of electricity. My math shows 21GWh is enough to power 16 million homes for a year. Rumsey: We believe it’s something like 80,000 medium-duty trucks. Of course it depends on your exact range, design, but just an order of magnitude of what’s 21 gigawatt hours.Truck Tech: How important is the onshoring of battery components given geopolitical considerations and the uncertainty at home? Rumsey: The reality is a lot of the battery technology and manufacturing know-how today is outside the U.S. LFP in particular. A lot of that is in China. We believe we have a strong technology partner that has the technology and manufacturing know-how and we’re going to bring that to the U.S. Create a plant here in the U.S. Create jobs in the U.S. and, over time, localize the supply chain to support this battery cell plant here in the U.S. That ensures our industry has the cell that will meet our needs as we electrify and also ensure that we have security of supply over time.Truck Tech: How much of a factor are the incentives from the IRA and the CHIPS and Science Act in deciding to go forward with this?Rumsey: Cummins has been pretty active in advocating for regulation and incentives. We think [they] are necessary to really drive innovation and scale these technologies. Today, they’re more expensive. Our customers need to know that the solutions that they are purchasing are going to allow them to continue to be successful. And that there’ll be an infrastructure to support them. The value of regulation and these incentives, in particular the IRA, is [that] it helps to offset some of the higher cost. It creates certainty for investment in these new technologies.Truck Tech: Some think incentives are tantamount to the beginnings of an industrial policy. Do you subscribe to this?Rumsey: As you go into these new technologies, we need policies and complementary measures that can help to decarbonize from wells to wheels. Incentives help drive the economics of who’s going to pay for this and how you drive innovation and scale up and bring cost down. Without [incentives], decarbonization will struggle.Cummins Chair and CEO Jennifer Rumsey talked about the new joint venture to bring battery cell production to the U.S. (Photo: Cummins)Cummins Chair and CEO Jennifer Rumsey talked about the new joint venture to bring battery cell production to the U.S. (Photo: Cummins)Briefly noted …Peterbilt marked the production of the 100,000th Model 389 long-hood Class 8 tractor at its plant in Denton, Texas.TuSimple (above) filed its overdue financials for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022, losing $138.4 million or 61 cents a share including layoff costs.ZF has developed a new electric motor that eliminates the need for rare earth magnets used in traditional electric drive motors.The Oman Investment Authority is betting on Michigan LFP battery startup Our Next Energy (ONE) with an undisclosed investment.The Volvo Trucks Customer Center has completed structural upgrades to the facility’s customer experience track in Dublin, Virginia, tripling the size of the 3-mile custom-designed course.Volvo Trucks North America has tripled the size of its customer experience center track in Dublin, Virginia.

More than 100,000 people would receive payouts. (Jae C. Hong / Associated Press)Walt Disney Co. has tentatively agreed to pay $9.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over the Magic Key pass program at Disneyland.The lawsuit — filed in 2021 by Dream Key pass holder Jenale Nielsen — alleged Disney had advertised that that particular pass, its most expensive offer, would not have any blackout dates.Upon buying the $1,399 annual pass in September 2021, a month after Disney remodeled its annual pass program under the Magic Key moniker, Nielsen found she was not able to reserve a ticket for much of November, despite single- and multi-day tickets still being available for the time period. She soon discovered additional restrictions, according to the lawsuit.An agreement to settle the suit was initially announced, without specifics, in July. The preliminary agreement unveiled Friday covers 103,435 Dream Key pass holders, all of whom will be automatically enrolled to receive a disbursement from the $9.5-million fund unless they request to be excluded.Read more: Disney reaches class-wide settlement in lawsuit over Magic Key annual pass programThe total amount to be disbursed will be determined after several deductions, including attorneys' fees for both parties, a service award for Nielsen and an estimated $147,547 in administrative costs for the settlement administrator.The preliminary agreement estimates each class member will receive about $67.41, though there could be a second round of payments depending on how much remains after initial distribution and fees.“We are satisfied that this matter has been resolved,” Disney officials said in an email statement to The Times in July.

The company now focusing only on its free speech claim. DeSantis politically retaliated against the company. Now, this marks the latest legal wrinkle in the ongoing Disney-DeSantis battle.The drama kicked off last year when Disney publicly denounced DeSantis, Don't Say Gay bill. So how did we get here? Well, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal and Rick Newman join me now. So Ale, I'll start with you first.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, Rachelle. Well, you're right. This is essentially a narrowing of that federal lawsuit. The big one, the First Amendment Free Speech claim is still there, which is that Governor DeSantis retaliated against the company due to its stance on the Parental Rights and Education Act, otherwise known as the Don't Say Gay bill.That bill is now a law, which prevents the education of sexual identity and gender from kindergarten to third grade in public schools. So while that element of the lawsuit is still intact, Disney did drop its other claims which centered on the company's development contracts.And Disney in a statement said they are still going to aggressively focus on those contracts, which allow it to invest billions in the state of Florida and therefore create thousands of jobs. So this has really been a back and forth tit for tat that has lasted for well over a year at this point with multiple counterclaims and suits from both sides.Story continuesYou're seeing the timeline right there on your screen. And this actually all stems back to when former CEO Bob Chapek was at the company. Chapek initially was silent on the bill, and he worked behind the scenes. That ultimately failed and he publicly denounced the bill later on, which led to the political firestorm we see today. And was one of the many reasons why he was ousted at the company in November.But I want to make clear that Disney is not backing down in any way. Bob Iger has remained very committed, saying that DeSantis is practices are both anti-business and anti-Florida. Now, on the flip side of that, Governor DeSantis in an interview with CNBC in August said that he's moved on from the lawsuit and that Disney should drop it at this point. So clearly more to come on this. It's not over yet, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. So Rick, I want to bring you in here because obviously, this became an anti-woke versus woke argument. It became this political football here. In terms of the optics and who's really coming out ahead in this optic game, is it DeSantis or is it Disney at this point?RICK NEWMAN: Well, DeSantis I think is not getting the traction that he wants to get by taking on what he calls woke capitalism. And I would add to what Ale said, there is still state litigation going on that is going to determine things such as whether Disney can continue its independent status with regard to its governing district down there.So we still have the narrowed federal case and the state litigation. And I think DeSantis at this point just wishes it would all go away. [CHUCKLES] Which is one of the reasons he said, hey, Disney, why don't you just knock it off. Disney's not going to do that.And it's worth pointing out that in his book, which came out earlier this year, DeSantis devoted a whole chapter to his battle with Disney. And he really bragged about taking on Disney and the woke establishment. So fast forward a few months to over the summer when DeSantis gave a big speech in New Hampshire outlining his economic vision.He did not use the phrase woke a single time. He did not mention Disney a single time either. So I read that as an indication that DeSantis has been trying out this theme on the campaign trail. He's trying to figure out ways where he can kind of stay aligned with Donald Trump, but also distinguish himself from Donald Trump.I think he tried out the crusade against woke capitalism as one way to do that. I just don't think it has worked. So I think that we're not going to hear DeSantis saying a lot more about it because at this point, he could lose in court. He could lose in court at the same time the 2024 election is in full swing. And I think he just wants people to focus on something else.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And Ale, as Rick was saying there, obviously, DeSantis saying he wishes, you know, that it would all go away. Basically saying he's moved past it. How much is Disney though still going to be focusing on this versus, say, the broader parts of its business?ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think for Disney, this is not fundamental to the business. Bob Iger has said that they haven't seen a reduction in Park attendance, specifically due to this firestorm. Also, Disney has a lot of other issues at the company, right? I mean, they're still bleeding money on the streaming side of things. Their box office titles, they haven't performed as well.We still have the issue of succession hanging over everyone's head and then they want to take ESPN fully over the top as a direct-to-consumer streaming service. So for Disney as a company, this seems to be a little bit of a sideshow for them. There are fundamental business problems that they need to address.First, obviously, this lawsuit an overhang in the background. This back and forth political firestorm obviously, not great PR for a company that prides itself as being the happiest place on Earth. But I think fundamentally, it doesn't really affect Disney's business. And they really need to focus on their sinking stock price and a lot of other issues at the company. And Bob Iger has made that clear as well.RICK NEWMAN: It might affect the state of Florida more than it affects Disney. Disney has made clear that they're reconsidering whether to invest money in Florida. They could put it somewhere else and a lot of business people in Florida are asking themselves is this a pro-business state or not?RACHELLE AKUFFO: And that's what it will come down to indeed. And obviously both DeSantis and Disney have bigger fish to fry. But as you mentioned there, something that would be perhaps more Florida-specific, especially when it comes to business investment. A big thank you there to our very own, Ale Canal and Rick Newman. Thank you to you both have a great weekend.RICK NEWMAN: Yep.]"

However, mounting expenses are expected to continue hurting M&amp;T Bank’s bottom-line growth.MTB’s rising net interest income (NII) and non-interest income has been supporting its top-line growth. NII is likely to be aided by a decent lending scenario and high interest rates in the upcoming quarters. Going forward, bulk purchase of residential mortgage rights this year will support fee income partially offset by lower trust revenues due to the sale of its CIT business.The company anticipates NII (tax equivalent basis) to rise in the range of $7-$7.2 billion in 2023. Also, management projects adjusted non-interest income to grow in the $2.25-$2.30 billion band. These are likely to drive top-line growth. Our model estimates revenues to rise 15.4% to $9.44 billion in 2023.M&amp;T Bank has a solid balance sheet position. Its deposit and loan balances increased in the past few years. Growth was supported by the acquisition of People’s United, which increased MTB’s loans by $36 billion and deposits by $53 billion.It has been focused on acquiring the industry's best deposit franchise. Hence, the company is expected to continue enjoying decent balance sheet strength in the near-term. In fact, management also envisions average deposit balances to rise in the second half of 2023. Average loan and lease balances are estimated to be $133 billion this year. We predict average loans and leases, net of unearned discount, to grow 11.9% in 2023.Given its solid balance sheet position, M&amp;T Bank is well positioned to grow via acquisitions. One of the many acquisitions was made in April 2022, when M&amp;T Bank bought People's United for $8.3 billion. The buyout was accretive to earnings. Further, product and balance sheet diversification, stemming from such buyouts, will likely support the company’s financials.Story continuesAs of Jun 30, 2023, the company’s total debt (comprising short-term and long-term borrowings) was significantly lower than the cash and due from banks as well as interest-bearing deposits at banks. Thus, the company seems well-positioned in terms of its liquidity profile and is likely to be able to continue meeting debt obligations in the near term if the economic situation worsens. Hence, its capital distributions seem sustainable and would, thus, enhance shareholders’ value.However, M&amp;T Bank’s escalating expenses over the years is exposed to operational risks. This uptrend is likely to continue in the near term, as management expects expenses excluding intangible amortization to rise to the higher end of $5-$5.1 billion band. Therefore, going forward, a rising cost base is likely to impede bottom-line growth. Our model suggests total non-interest expenses to rise at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.6% over the next three years.Deteriorating credit quality remains a major headwind for MTB. It built substantial reserves over the past few years. Further, non-performing assets also disappointed with a five-year CAGR (ended 2022) of 20.6%. Management expects net charge-off ratio to increase and migrate toward its long-term average of 33 basis points.M&amp;T Bank has substantial exposure to commercial and commercial real estate loans. The current rapidly changing macroeconomic backdrop may put some strain on commercial lending. Thus, lack of loan portfolio diversification is likely to hurt the company’s financials if the economic situation worsens.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) companyhave lost 10.6% over the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 4.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFinance Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the finance space are BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. BBVA and HSBC Holdings’ HSBC.BBVA’s current-year earnings estimate has been revised 4.4% upward over the past 30 days.

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) stands at 3.81. Given these figures, the question arises: is this stock significantly undervalued? This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of Helmerich &amp; Payne's valuation, encouraging readers to delve into the financial intricacies of this potentially undervalued stock.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with HP. Click here to check it out. HP 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HPHelmerich &amp; Payne, boasting the largest fleet of U.S. land drilling rigs, is a major player in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The company's FlexRig line is the leading choice for drilling horizontal wells for the production of U.S. tight oil and gas. With a presence in almost every major U.S. shale play and a growing international footprint, Helmerich &amp; Payne is a force to be reckoned with. The company's stock is currently trading at $43.83, while the GF Value, an estimation of its fair value, stands at $67.34. This discrepancy suggests that the stock could be significantly undervalued.Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP)'s Hidden Bargain: An In-Depth Look at the 25% Margin of Safety Based on its ValuationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a unique metric that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on historical multiples that the stock has traded at, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on this valuation method, Helmerich &amp; Payne (NYSE:HP) appears to be significantly undervalued. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. At its current price of $43.83 per share, Helmerich &amp; Payne's stock shows every sign of being significantly undervalued.Story continuesBecause Helmerich &amp; Payne is significantly undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much higher than its business growth.Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP)'s Hidden Bargain: An In-Depth Look at the 25% Margin of Safety Based on its ValuationEvaluating Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Helmerich &amp; Payne has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.54, which ranks better than 50.64% of 1021 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Helmerich &amp; Payne's financial strength as 8 out of 10, suggesting a strong balance sheet.Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP)'s Hidden Bargain: An In-Depth Look at the 25% Margin of Safety Based on its ValuationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Helmerich &amp; Payne has been profitable 5 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $2.80 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $3.81. Its operating margin of 17.87% is better than 64.84% of 967 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Helmerich &amp; Payne's profitability as fair.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of Helmerich &amp; Payne is-9%, which ranks worse than 82% of 850 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -4.7%, which ranks worse than 74.02% of 820 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, Helmerich &amp; Payne's return on invested capital is 10.13, and its cost of capital is 10.49.Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP)'s Hidden Bargain: An In-Depth Look at the 25% Margin of Safety Based on its ValuationConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Helmerich &amp; Payne (NYSE:HP) appears to be significantly undervalued.

(NASDAQ:NDAQ) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sure-check-nasdaq-inc-nasdaq-120940925.html,1694261380,STORY,['NDAQ'],"[Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know that Nasdaq, Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Nasdaq's shares before the 14th of September in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.22 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.88 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Nasdaq has a trailing yield of 1.7% on the current share price of $51.43. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Nasdaq's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether Nasdaq can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Nasdaq If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Nasdaq paid out a comfortable 36% of its profit last year.When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. This is why it's a relief to see Nasdaq earnings per share are up 9.0% per annum over the last five years.Story continuesMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the last 10 years, Nasdaq has lifted its dividend by approximately 18% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Nasdaq worth buying for its dividend? It has been growing its earnings per share somewhat in recent years, although it reinvests more than half its earnings in the business, which could suggest there are some growth projects that have not yet reached fruition. Overall, Nasdaq looks like a promising dividend stock in this analysis, and we think it would be worth investigating further.With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Nasdaq you should be aware of.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

The news comes as interest is increasing in artificial intelligence and the different ways it can be used in capital markets.M-ELO, first released in 2018, is a strategic order type that enables investors with longer-term horizons to trade with each other using a 10-millisecond waiting period.The dynamic version of this will use an AI technique known as reinforcement learning to watch market behavior and make real-time adjustments to that holding period to improve the quality of execution and percentage of order filled in the market.Nasdaq's research shows that the real-time AI order type has a 20.3% increase in fill rates and an 11.4% reduction in mark-outs, indicating the improvements AI-powered solutions can bring to capital markets.""This new order type can increase order fill rate and reduce holding time if successfully implemented, which could help Nasdaq take market shares from other exchange operators,"" said Owen Lau, senior analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.(Reporting by Laura Matthews; Editing by Mark Porter)]"

240,3d274f87-3cf3-3983-8962-e4922131b5ed,PSA,2023-09-09,Unlocking Long-Term Value: 3 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy Now on the Dip,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unlocking-long-term-value-3-120000379.html,1694174400,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'SBUX', 'PSA', 'PAYC']","[Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks explores the stock market as the bulls and bears fight for control in the early weeks of September. Despite the possibility of more near-term uncertainty, volatility, and selling, the overall upbeat backdrop that drove much of the 2023 rally remains in place.Therefore, investors with long-term horizons might want to consider buying proven S&amp;P 500 stocks that are trading at levels that could look like steals years or even months from now. The three stocks we explore today are Starbucks (SBUX), Paycom Software (PAYC), and Public Storage (PSA).The recent downturn in the early days of a traditionally poor month for stocks has seen the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq slide back below their 50-day moving averages. The bulls might have to hold their ground in the lead-up to the August CPI release on September 13. Yet, the nearby chart showcases how the Nasdaq is interacting with its 21-week moving average (red line) and why it might indicate more bullishness going forward.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNow might be a time for investors to take a giant step back and remember to block out the constant noise and look to the two biggest drivers of stock prices: earnings and interest rates.Zacks estimates call for S&amp;P 500 earnings to soar 11.7% in 2024 and another 10.9% in 2025 vs. a projected decline of -3.2% in 2023. And Jay Powell and Co. remain near the end of their tightening cycle.Rates might have to stay higher for longer as the U.S. economy remains resilient. In fact, the higher rates signal ongoing strength and growth, which further supports the soft landing that more Wall Street giants are calling for.All told, it might be time for investors to take one of Warren Buffett’s most used mantras to heart and “be greedy when others are fearful” and start looking at large-cap S&amp;P 500 stocks that have fallen out of favor and are trading at levels that might look likes steals years from now.Story continuesStarbucks (SBUX) is the coffee shop powerhouse that boasts over 37,000 stores globally. The company has grown at an impressive clip for over 20 years to become one of the most valuable brands in the world. SBUX’s e-commerce, delivery, and other digital initiatives have helped it thrive in the changing retail environment, with its app one of the most downloaded food and drink apps in the world last year, behind only McDonald’s (MCD), Uber Eats, and DoorDash.Starbucks topped our Q3 FY23 earnings estimates in early August, as it showcased impressive resilience amid slowing consumer spending, with global comparable sales up 10%. SBUX is improving how its stores and supply chains operate and working on expanding in smaller cities and towns. Some are worried about consumers in its two largest markets—the U.S. and China—but Zacks estimates call for it to post 11% YoY revenue growth both this year and next to help boot its adjusted earnings by around 17% each year.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStarbucks, which currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has soared 1,200% over the last 20 years vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 350% and McDonald’s 1,100%. Yet, SBUX trades 25% below its peaks and 21% under its average Zacks price target. Some investors might want to wait for it to cross above some key moving averages. But coffee isn’t going out of style and neither is Starbucks. SBUX is also trading at a 36% discount its highs and 10% below its 10-year median at 23.8X forward earnings.Paycom Software (PAYC) was a pioneer in digital HR and payroll technology over 20 years ago. Paycom’s cloud software today helps with onboarding, benefits enrollment, talent management, and beyond. PAYC and other similar software are now deeply embedded and essential at companies big and small. And Paycom’s decade of impressive double-digit revenue growth backs up its value and vital nature.Paycom topped our Q2 earnings and sales estimates in early August and upped its guidance as it expands its total addressable market to “include larger North American organizations with both domestic and foreign employees.” Zacks estimates call for it to post 25% revenue and earnings growth this year and 21% higher sales and EPS in 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPaycom stock has skyrocketed since its 2014 IPO, but it is currently trading 50% below its record highs. The downturn, coupled with its earnings outlook helps its valuation look far more reasonable. Plus, PAYC earlier this year began to pay a dividend for the first time to highlight its overall financial strength.Public Storage (PSA) is one of the largest self-storage companies in the country, with roughly 3,000 facilities in the U.S. and almost two million customers. PSA is a REIT that’s been gaining momentum for years as Americans continue to buy tons of stuff, big and small. The company’s revenue has soared over the last 20-plus years, including 22% growth in 2022.Zacks estimates call for PSA to post 8% revenue growth in FY23 and 6% higher sales in FY24, which would mark stronger expansion compared to the several-year stretch prior to its Covid boom. Public Storage’s adjusted FFO (which are essentially earnings for REITs) are projected to climb by roughly 5% during both years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPSA shares have climbed 600% over the last 20 years to crush the benchmark. Public Storage is still up nearly 30% in the past three years even though it is down 35% from its peaks. PSA is currently trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple since the initial Covid crash (15.5X), which puts it at decade-long lows even though the stock has climbed 75% in the past 10 year. Plus, Public Storage lifted its dividend by 50% earlier this year, with it yielding 4.5% at the moment.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

An Intuit Assist is really a personalized intelligent assistant in your pocket. It's also powered by AI-driven human experts. So that when you are getting assistance from Intuit Assist, if you ever need to talk to an expert, no matter what it is that you're doing, you're able to do that. So there's always a gateway to help.GEORGE ARISON: AI is going to change this whole industry completely. And so we're thinking a lot about how do we use AI to match people a lot better and to support the conversations that are happening.I think conversational AI is also a big opportunity because people do produce all these messages.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide McDonald's with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's How Fast Is McDonald's Growing?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Impressively, McDonald's has grown EPS by 20% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of McDonald's shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 43% to 46% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for McDonald's' future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre McDonald's Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of McDonald's, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$366m. We note that this amounts to 0.2% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of McDonald's but it's still worth mentioning. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Is McDonald's Worth Keeping An Eye On?You can't deny that McDonald's has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.14% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.22%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.09%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the industrial real estate developer had gained 0.94% over the past month. This has outpaced the Finance sector's loss of 4.09% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 1.27% in that time.Prologis will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Prologis to post earnings of $1.26 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 27.17%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $1.72 billion, up 48.96% from the year-ago period.PLD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.59 per share and revenue of $6.75 billion.

(NASDAQ:TROW) Before The Ex-Dividend Date",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-buy-t-120413625.html,1694261053,STORY,['TROW'],"[Readers hoping to buy T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, T. Rowe Price Group investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of September will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 28th of September.The company's next dividend payment will be US$1.22 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.88 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that T. Rowe Price Group has a trailing yield of 4.5% on the current share price of $109.24. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether T. Rowe Price Group's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to investigate whether T. Rowe Price Group can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for T. Rowe Price Group Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. T. Rowe Price Group paid out more than half (72%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.Companies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at T. Rowe Price Group, with earnings per share up 2.1% on average over the last five years.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. T. Rowe Price Group has delivered an average of 14% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.The Bottom LineIs T. Rowe Price Group worth buying for its dividend? T. Rowe Price Group has been generating some growth in earnings per share while paying out more than half of its earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends. In sum this is a middling combination, and we find it hard to get excited about the company from a dividend perspective.Curious what other investors think of T. Rowe Price Group? See what analysts are forecasting, with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flow.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

252,363462ad-0d07-356c-b30e-04b7efd89ab8,UPS,2023-09-09,"FedEx keeps rate, surcharge increases relatively modest for ’24",FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-keeps-rate-surcharge-increases-182203131.html,1694197323,STORY,"['FDX', 'UPS']","[FedEx keeps most rate, surcharge hikes in single-digit range. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The dust has settled on FedEx Corp.’s and UPS Inc.’s headline tariff rate increases for 2024. Both carriers have clocked in with 5.9% general rate increases (GRIs), 100 basis points below the record 6.9% increases for 2023.As always, though, the real action is going on under the hood. The carriers will go to market with an array of rate increases and delivery surcharges that vary depending on the specific service, distance, weight and other factors. Those are the numbers that shippers and their parcel consultant partners will be watching, and that they will bargain from, as contracts get negotiated or renegotiated. Almost all parcel-delivery services are based on contracts rather than one-off or occasional services where a tariff rate might apply.UPS (NYSE: UPS), which announced its 2024 GRI Thursday night, has yet to publish its rate schedule for next year. FedEx, which generally acts before its rival, went out with its GRI on Aug. 29 and published its rate and surcharge details Thursday.One unusual move is that FedEx (NYSE: FDX) will hike its ground-delivery minimum charge by 5.9% to $10.70, matching its GRI increase. Hikes in ground minimums, which have been on a steady rise for years, typically exceed the pace of GRI increases, according to Paul Yaussy, senior professional services consultant for Shipware LLC, a consultancy. Next year will be different, however.FedEx will impose a 7.9% increase to its minimum charge for next-business-morning deliveries known as Priority Overnight. This brings the levy to $39.96, according to data from TransImpact LLC, a consultancy. Second-day delivery minimums will rise to $23.83, a 5.5% increase, according to the consultancy.FedEx’s ground rates will vary depending on package weight. Rate increases will be below the headline GRI for parcels weighing up to 10 pounds, according to data from AFS Logistics Inc., a non-asset-based provider that negotiates, audits and pays about $4 billion in annual parcel expenditures. From there, rate increases will exceed 6%, peaking at 6.71% for parcels weighing between 51 and 70 pounds.Story continuesFedEx will hike rates, on average, by 6.19% across all weight breaks, which includes parcels over 70 pounds, according to AFS.On its primary surcharges, FedEx is keeping increases in the single digits. This may be a response to the blah demand environment and shipper resistance to double-digit surcharge increases that have been the norm in recent years.It may also be a way to pressure UPS, which must manage through very high labor cost increases during the first year of a five-year contract with the Teamsters union, while winning back business diverted to rivals during the weeks and months leading up to the contract’s Aug. 22 ratification. Yaussy said that UPS’ rates and surcharges will come close to matching FedEx’s, although the labor cost pressures may compel UPS to impose higher surcharges and hope its shippers won’t notice.Residential delivery surcharges on FedEx’s Home Delivery product will be capped at 7.7%, while surcharges on deliveries made by FedEx Express will be held to 6%, according to TransImpact.Delivery area surcharge increases will range between 5.4% and 8.9%, depending on whether a package is shipped via air or ground, as well as the distance the package has to travel. The longer the trip and the longer the package is in the FedEx system, the higher the surcharge will be.Outlier surcharges, such as for additional handling services, will jump substantially, reflecting FedEx’s higher costs to process shipments requiring special services, as well as its desire not to handle them at all because the shipments might not move optimally through an automated operation. For a shipment whose actual weight is more than 50 pounds and requires special handling, the surcharge will jump 19% to 26.1% depending on the distance traveled, according to Shipware data. For shipments whose dimensions exceed FedEx’s handling requirements, surcharges will increase by 18.9% to 27.7%. For shipments whose packaging doesn’t comport with FedEx requirements, the levies will increase by 18.2% to 22%.FedEx will also impose punishing surcharges on super-large shipments that exceed the dimensional limits covered under the additional-handling charges. Those levies will increase in a range of 18.5% to 24.2%, depending on the delivery distance and whether the package is destined for a residential or commercial address.The pace of surcharge increases may have moderated from recent years when the pandemic fueled off-the-chart leaps in delivery demand. Still, they are well above current inflation rates, meaning they are ripe for being beaten back by shippers already operating in a slower demand climate.“In the current market, all shippers should be negotiating these charges down. Because the rates go up at such a high rate, even higher than the rate of inflation, every year, the carriers are practically inviting a negotiation of the rates,” said Yaussy.Yaussy advised shippers to begin negotiating before the new rates take effect as long as it’s been at least a year since the prior negotiation and there are no contractual terms prohibiting a reopening of the contract.FedEx’s 2024 rate and surcharge changes take effect Jan. 1. UPS’ take effect Dec. 26.Jey Yokeley, vice president, parcel sales at TransImpact, said that shippers who send significant volumes and have long-standing relationships with their carriers are in an advantageous negotiating position. “A high-volume shipper is more valuable to a carrier in the current environment. Unlike the last couple of years when national carriers limited their commitment to large-scale shippers, the current environment has created an enhanced focus on protecting higher volume clients by the carriers to maintain volume thresholds and increase density within their networks,” he said.Shippers who can demonstrate a willingness or ability to switch to alternative carriers can sometimes use this as a negotiating point, particularly in the current market where carriers are hyper-focused on converting new business opportunities and are willing to pay for it, Yokeley saId.Most shippers have contracts allowing for unrestricted reviews or renegotiations, Yokeley said. “Just as the carriers possess the ability to implement annual rate hikes and seasonal surcharges at their discretion, shippers equally withhold the power to renegotiate and reduce their costs on a regular cadence,” he said.The post FedEx keeps rate, surcharge increases relatively modest for ’24 appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Unilever bought premium frozen yogurt brand Yasso in North America, while Snickers maker Mars acquired healthy foods maker Kevin's Natural Foods.""There's been a nice uptick in M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) in the food industry in the first half of the year...,"" said Michael Milani, executive managing director and principal at advisory firm Baker Tilly.""It has been a big theme, and we expect that to continue in the back half of 2023 and into early 2024.""This is despite higher borrowing costs straining companies looking for acquisitions.The value of deals in the U.S. food and beverage industry slipped nearly 3% to about $10.39 billion this year, according to LSEG data. But their volumes climbed 17.5% to 248 as of Sept. 1, making the industry a bright spot in dealmaking.The total number of deals across all industry sectors slid 4% in the same period, data showed. ""Large food companies need to add more new concepts, new flavor profiles and new food items because their old brands - though still growing - are not growing at a meaningful rate,"" Milani said.The rise in deals comes as volume of sales at companies such as Kraft Heinz and Campbell fell for at least the past six quarters due to weak demand, while benefits from price hikes also fade.""I would expect there to be a continued drumbeat of M&amp;A,"" said Sarah Henry, managing director and portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, which holds shares in PepsiCo and Mondelez International.Packaged food companies ""are now faced with some difficult comparisons on organic (sales) and are seeking some strategic, category-specific M&amp;A targets that will propel them through the next few years,"" Henry said.Story continuesCheerios cereal maker General Mills has pinned M&amp;A as a key goal in the coming years, with executives saying it is a ""good environment for M&amp;A right now.""For Mondelez, bolt-on acquisitions are the way to go, the Oreo maker's finance chief Luca Zaramella had recently said at a Barclays conference.Last month, Reuters reported that Twinkies snack cakes maker Hostess Brands was exploring a sale and that Mondelez and Hershey could be in the race to buy it.J.P. Morgan analysts said they could be eyeing Hostess to expand outside of North America.""Most of the large cap packaged food companies have ... diligently reduced their debt and improved their balance sheet (through the pandemic)...so they have the risk capacity and risk appetite to pursue large-scale acquisitions,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.""These packaged food companies need to continue finding ways to stay relevant ... And so one of the easiest ways to do that is through M&amp;A.""(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Boston Scientific:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.077 = US$2.2b ÷ (US$34b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Boston Scientific has an ROCE of 7.7%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.7%. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific roceIn the above chart we have measured Boston Scientific's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Boston Scientific.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Boston Scientific, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 7.7% from 11% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesOn a side note, Boston Scientific has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 14% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.What We Can Learn From Boston Scientific's ROCETo conclude, we've found that Boston Scientific is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 44% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you want to continue researching Boston Scientific, you might be interested to know about the 3 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Boston Scientific may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The need to equip the jet with technological upgrades has resulted in Boeing winning several contracts to modernize the jet with evolving technologies.Per the report from Statista, Japan owned 200 F-15J/DJ fighters as of Mar 31, 2023. This highlights the possibility of more order inflows for Boeing to win such upgrade contracts, like the latest one, thus boosting its revenues from the defense line of business.What Lies Ahead?A strong defense structure acts as a deterrent against potential threats. Nations are augmenting their defense purchase to strengthen their warfare capabilities. This has led to the increased demand for fighter jets that boast advanced technology and are equipped with efficient arms and ammunition.Per the report from the Coherent Market Insights firm, the global military aircraft market is poised to witness a CAGR of 5.4% over the 2022-2030 period.Such abounding growth prospects are expected to boost Boeing’s position in the military aircraft market.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Coca-Cola with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Coca-Cola's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Coca-Cola grew its EPS by 4.4% per year. This may not be setting the world alight, but it does show that EPS is on the upwards trend.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. EBIT margins for Coca-Cola remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 6.9% to US$44b.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$1.7b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.7% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Is Coca-Cola Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Coca-Cola is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth.

Accelerating digital investments also bodes well. Companies are expected to gain from expansion into newer categories and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the Ready-to-Drink (""RTD"") alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. Players like The Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc., Fomento Economico Mexicano, Monster Beverage Corp. and Keurig Dr Pepper are well-poised on robust innovation efforts.However, industry players are witnessing continued pressure from higher supply-chain costs, including transportation and commodity costs, particularly steel and aluminum. The companies' actions, including price increases, reducing reliance on imported cans and moving production closer to markets, are poised to combat these headwinds. Elevated operating expenses related to increased spending on marketing and advertising to capture a share are likely to strain margins in the near term.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry comprises companies that manufacture, source, develop, market and sell non-alcoholic beverages. Soft drinks mainly include sparkling drinks, natural juices, enhanced water, sports and energy drinks, dairy, RTD tea and coffee beverages. Some industry players like PepsiCo produce and sell handy food with flavored snacks, complementing their beverage portfolio.The companies sell products through a network of wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, department stores, mass merchandisers, club stores and other retail outlets. Some also offer products via company-owned or controlled bottling, independent bottling partners and partner brand owners.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of the Beverages - Soft Drinks Industry?Innovation &amp; Digital Growth: The soft drinks industry is poised to gain from innovations and accelerating digital investments. The companies have been optimizing their portfolio, focusing on core brands and investments in innovation to meet the evolving needs of consumers. The players remain committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. Expansion into newer markets has been a critical focus for soft drink makers to boost market share.The companies are expected to reap the benefits of digital and technology-driven investments based on the shifting consumer preference for online shopping. Companies in the industry have been accelerating investments to build strong digital capabilities by piloting numerous digital-enabled fulfillment options. They have been expanding digital offerings and investing in loyalty programs to capture online demand. The investments are likely to position soft drink companies for long-term growth.Evolving Trends: Soft drink companies have been gaining from improved demand trends, aiding volume growth. Due to recovery across markets, market share gains in at-home and away-from-home channels have been boosting sales. Price increases to overcome the ongoing cost pressures have significantly lifted sales in recent quarters.The soft drinks industry has transformed as health consciousness, personal well-being, natural ingredients, varied flavors and better taste experiences are changing consumers' consumption patterns. Companies in the industry are expected to benefit from the expansion into newer and adjacent categories, including capturing market share in the fast-growing RTD alcoholic beverage category through collaborations. RTD has emerged as the fastest-growing category since 2018.

The tie-up is aimed at exploring opportunities to develop and commercialize flow cytometry-based companion diagnostics and tools for clinical decisions.Navigate BioPharma Services, Inc., a provider of innovative biomarker and specialty bioanalytic solutions for clinical development and companion diagnostic applications, is an independently operating subsidiary within the Novartis group of companies.The latest partnership is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s foothold in the global Biosciences (BDB) business, which is part of its broader Life Sciences arm.Rationale Behind the CollaborationThe collaboration is expected to leverage the expertise and capabilities of both companies to provide end-to-end solutions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These companies are developing novel therapies that require companion diagnostics, tests intended to match patients with advanced treatments and critical clinical trial applications that use flow cytometry. The partnership also aims to address a critical gap in the clinical trial field for an integrated solution provider from method development to commercialization.Per BD’s management, the partnership will likely combine Navigate BioPharma's experience in designing and validating biomarker assays for clinical trials and regulatory submissions with the broad BD portfolio of flow cytometry instruments, reagents, software and in vitro diagnostics (IVD) development services. This, in turn, is expected to potentially accelerate the delivery of innovative personalized therapies to patients who need them.Navigate BioPharma's management believes that flow cytometry-based companion diagnostics can aid in identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from a specific therapy, monitor their response to treatment and optimize dosing and safety from a patient sample. Hence, advances in flow cytometry technology made by BD will likely enable IVD testing to be executed with accuracy, automation and standardization across all elements of the workflow.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by BCC Research, the global market for flow cytometry was valued at $5.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $7.6 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 8%.

281,a5fdcc27-c4b2-3648-8961-7aa4ce834ff0,GE,2023-09-09,"Airlines, Engine Makers Race to Track Down Bogus Spare Parts",Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airlines-engine-makers-race-track-081820190.html,1694247500,STORY,"['BA', 'EADSY', 'GE', 'LUV']","[(Bloomberg) -- Airlines and aircraft engine makers are racing to identify bogus spare parts that have infiltrated the global fleet via an obscure UK supplier, a potentially costly and complicated forensic endeavor affecting the world’s most widely flown passenger jets.Most Read from BloombergChina Sows Fresh Confusion About Apple With Security RemarksCiti Plans Job Cuts as It Revamps Top Management StructureLuxury Cruise Ship Full of Australians Stuck in Greenland ArcticiPhone Pro’s Titanium Finish Stands Out in First Look at DeviceWall Street Yawns at ‘Not Great, No Disaster’ CPI: Markets WrapSouthwest Airlines Co. said Friday that it had removed two “suspect parts” traced to closely held AOG Technics Ltd. from one of its Boeing Co. 737 aircraft, becoming the first major carrier to publicly disclose doing so. Hours earlier, CFM International Inc., the joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA that makes the engines for many older-generation Airbus SE A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft, said parts with fraudulent documentation had been put on 68 of its power plants.The widening scandal has shaken an industry where safety is the guiding principle, with exacting standards for aircraft manufacturing and maintenance that demands each component be verified. Regulators, airlines and other industry players have been scouring their records to hunt down the suspect components sold by AOG, the obscure supplier at the center of the crisis.CFM, the world’s largest jet-engine manufacturer, filed a lawsuit in the UK against AOG Technics. The suit seeks an injunction to force AOG to provide more information to aid the aviation industry’s search for suspect components. It also seeks to recover any parts in AOG’s possession purported to be from CFM or GE.In response to questions from Bloomberg News, which first reported on the AOG case, Southwest said that two low-pressure turbine blades were the components it pulled from one of its engines. The carrier took “precautionary and immediate measures” to remove them based on the fact they were supplied by AOG.Story continuesThe parts were found in an engine on a Boeing 737 NG, an older version of Boeing’s most popular model. CFM supplies engines to both the Airbus and the Boeing planes. In the last decade, both models have undergone a technical upgrade with new engines — the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max — that use different powerplants not affected by the AOG case.Still, the CFM56 model is the most widely used jet engine in service today. It has been used on single-aisle planes for decades, with more than 33,000 engines delivered to more than 600 operators worldwide. The single-aisle Airbus and Boeing jets are used by millions of passengers each day and by most airlines, mainly on short-haul flights.To date, CFM and GE Aerospace have found 78 documents they say are falsified and which cover 52 CFM56 engine part numbers, along with two faked records for CF6 components. AOG has no direct affiliation with CFM or its partners.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency earlier this week determined that the components backed by forged documentation included turbine blades, a critical component of an aircraft’s propulsion system.Airbus has said it’s aware of reports surrounding AOG, while Boeing has deferred to regulators on the topic.Representatives for AOG could not be reached for immediate comment. Based on the UK’s Companies House records, AOG was established in 2015. The supplier of parts to third-party engine repair shops was created by Jose Zamora Yrala, who hasn’t responded to emails or phone calls seeking comment.“Safety is our first priority, and we are taking aggressive legal action against AOG Technics to accelerate the industry’s ability to identify parts sold by this third-party with falsified documentation,” a CFM spokesman said in a statement.No incidents linked to the suspect parts have been identified, CFM and GE have said. EASA said last week that while the parts of questionable origin are “a matter for concern, to date there have been no reports of problems resulting from the suspect unapproved parts.”Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and engine makers go to great lengths inspecting their equipment to identify faults or fatigue, a practice that has contributed to ever-lower incidents in an industry priding itself as being among the safest modes of transport. When unforeseen faults to crop up — even those that are not deemed a safety issue — they can lead to lengthy and costly repairs.--With assistance from Albertina Torsoli.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekADHD Drug Shortages Worsen as Makers Say Production Is Maxed OutJames Dolan’s $2.3 Billion Sphere Is Raising Eyebrows—in a Good WayInvestors Stand by Israel’s Tech Startups, for NowGoodbye, California.

It's great to see the Indians so appreciative that we've come,"" Kurt Campbell, the senior U.S. official for Indo-Pacific policy, told reporters after the discussions.The leaders were working on a ""major breakthrough"" related to infrastructure and communications that would link India with the Middle East and Europe, that could be announced on Saturday, Campbell said.The U.S., India, and Gulf countries have been talking about a sweeping new rail and ports network to link the regions, a counterpoint to China's 'Belt and Road' global infrastructure plans.India and the U.S. will also cooperate in 2024 on the International Space Station, 5G and 6G technology and microchips, said Eileen Laubacher, U.S. National Security Council senior director for South Asia.As Biden and Modi met at the Prime Minister's residence, the U.S. press corps was sequestered in a van, out of eyesight of the two leaders - an unusual situation for the reporters and photographers who follow the U.S. President at home and around the world to witness and record his public appearances.The prime minister's office released a handful of official photographs of the meeting, showing the two leaders seated side by side and chatting amiably.Biden and Modi last met in person in June when the Indian leader was the guest of a White House state visit. The two men were expected to advance a number of agreements reached in June, including a deal to allow General Electric to produce jet engines in India to power Indian military aircraft.Story continuesU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen joined Friday's meeting, as did White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the White House said in a statement. Indian attendees included external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and security adviser Ajit Doval.Though the countries are not formal treaty-bound allies and India has long relished its independence, Washington wants Delhi to be a strategic counterweight to China.Armed with cash for the World Bank and promises of sustained U.S. engagement, Biden hopes to persuade fast-growing economies in Africa, Latin America and Asia that there is an alternative to China's Belt and Road project, which has funneled billions of dollars to developing countries but left many deeply in debt.After the G20, Biden is to visit Vietnam before returning to the United States later on Monday.CRITICISM OF PRESS FREEDOMSQuestions about press access on the India trip have been persistent, after the official White House schedule did not show that the usual pool of reporters would be allowed in for the start of the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden spoke to Modi about the importance of a healthy democracy, Campbell told reporters. ""He doesn't do this in such a way that suggests that one country is lecturing to another but rather that we all face shared challenges,"" he said.Campbell said he would not be drawn into a discussion about press access, saying Biden preferred to address such topics privately.The press pool from the United States, made up of representatives of major news organizations, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips and normally has some access to major events. News organizations reimburse the U.S. government completely for the cost of the trips, and it is extremely rare for them to be barred completely.The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of speech and the press in the United States, while freedom and expression of speech is protected in Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.Modi, of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, has faced criticism about shrinking press freedom in India since he took office. The government says India has a vibrant free press.Modi, who rarely meets the press or answers journalist's questions in India, was asked by an American reporter at a joint news conference with Biden at the White House in June about his human rights record.His allies attacked the reporter afterward, in a targeted online harassment campaign that the White House later called ""unacceptable"" and ""antithetical to the very principles of democracy.""

In just the last two months, the price of oil has rallied and an astonishing 30% and isn’t slowing down. After putting in a bottom earlier this year, and more recently breaking above a major level of resistance, the trend is clearly pointing higher.The energy sector has led the market over the last week, month and three months, indicating considerable relative strength.Higher oil prices mean more profit for oil and energy adjacent companies. Enerplus ERF, Valero Energy VLO, and Parr Pacific PARR are three stocks that are likely to benefit from higher oil prices. Furthermore, each of these stocks enjoys reasonable valuations, and extremely compelling technical chart setups.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewEnerplusEnerplus Corporation is a Canadian energy company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas resources. With a diversified portfolio of assets across North America, Enerplus focuses on optimizing production and capitalizing on growth opportunities in both conventional and unconventional resource plays. The company's strategic approach, combined with its commitment to operational efficiency and sustainability, positions it as a significant player in the energy sector, poised to leverage evolving market dynamics.Enerplus has recently seen some significant increases in its earnings estimates, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 33% over the last month, while FY23 estimates have been boosted by 11%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLast week, Enerplus broke out from a standard bull flag following another leg higher in the price of oil. Then on Thursday’s trading, the price retested the breakout level and reversed hard. This is very bullish price action and provides a very asymmetric trading opportunity.If ERF stock trades above $17.50, which is Thursday’s high, the next leg higher should begin. However, if it trades below the $17 level, investors may want to steer clear as the setup will be invalidated.Story continuesTradingViewImage Source: TradingViewEnerplus is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 7.7x, which is below the industry average of 10.4x, and below its 10-year median of 9.2x. Furthermore, the company pays a dividend yield of 1.4%.Valero EnergyValero Energy is one of the largest independent petroleum refiners and marketers in the United States. Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, Valero operates several refineries across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. The company produces a variety of products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, distillates, jet fuel, asphalt, petrochemicals, and more. Apart from refining operations, Valero also has a significant presence in the ethanol industry.VLO today has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, but its style scores indicate that improvements may be just around the corner. The stock boasts an ‘A’ grade across the Value, Growth, Momentum and VGM style scores. Furthermore, EPS are forecast to grow by 6% annually over the next 3-5 years.Like the others, Valero Energy stock has been building a compelling technical chart pattern. Just this week, VLO stock cleared the $134.70 level, signaling a breakout. So long as the stock doesn’t reverse back below that level, it should continue to rally significantly.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewPar PacificPar Pacific manages and maintains interests in energy and infrastructure businesses. The company's operating segment consists of refining, retail and logistics. It also markets and distributes crude oil from the Western United States and Canada to refining hubs in the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast and to Hawaii. Par Pacific Holdings, Inc., formerly known as Par Petroleum Corporation, is headquartered in Houston, Texas.Although PARR currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, the company’s quarterly earninga shows above expected performance. At the most recent quarterly meeting Parr Pacific reported EPS of $1.73 per share, which was 44% above analysts' expectations.But what really drew me to PARR stock is the picture-perfect technical pattern. Parr Pacific stock has formed an extremely tight bull flag from which the price looks like it is about to launch higher from. If the stock can break out above the $36.30 level, it should push to another new all-time high. Alternatively, if it loses the level of support, and trades below $34.30, the setup is invalid, and investors should look for other opportunities.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewBottom LineIt looks like the energy market may be in the midst of another major bull run, and thus investors should consider reloading their portfolios with oil and gas stocks. Of course, even the best trading setups can fail, so investors should always keep risk management front of mind and stick to a trading plan.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

290,df623812-5bce-38de-86b3-2a0a3af007bb,UNH,2023-09-09,Here is What to Know Beyond Why UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-unitedhealth-group-130010340.html,1694178010,STORY,['UNH'],"[UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned -3.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has lost 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $6.36 per share, indicating a change of +9.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +11.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $27.94 indicates a change of +12.5% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UnitedHealth.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $91.44 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13%. For the current and next fiscal years, $367.84 billion and $391.6 billion estimates indicate +13.5% and +6.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $92.9 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.7%. EPS of $6.14 for the same period compares with $5.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $90.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.54%. The EPS surprise was +3.72%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's deep dive into UnitedHealth Group Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.What Does UnitedHealth Group Inc Do?Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with UNH. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?UnitedHealth Group is one of the largest private health insurers, providing medical benefits to about 53 million members globally, including 5 million outside the U.S. as of mid-2023.

Along with its insurance assets, UnitedHealth's continued investments in its Optum franchises have created a healthcare services colossus that spans everything from medical and pharmaceutical benefits to providing outpatient care and analytics to both affiliated and third-party customers.Exploring UnitedHealth Group Inc's Dividend Prospects: A Deep Dive into the NumbersA Glimpse at UnitedHealth Group Inc's Dividend HistoryUnitedHealth Group Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1990. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. UnitedHealth Group Inc has increased its dividend each year since 1990. The stock is thus listed as a dividend aristocrat, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 33 years.Exploring UnitedHealth Group Inc's Dividend Prospects: A Deep Dive into the NumbersBreaking Down UnitedHealth Group Inc's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, UnitedHealth Group Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.46%. This suggests an expectation of increase dividend payments over the next 12 months.Story continuesOver the past three years, UnitedHealth Group Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 15.60%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 17.40% per year. And over the past decade, UnitedHealth Group Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at an impressive 23.00%.Based on UnitedHealth Group Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of UnitedHealth Group Inc stock as of today is approximately 3.14%.Exploring UnitedHealth Group Inc's Dividend Prospects: A Deep Dive into the NumbersThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, UnitedHealth Group Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.31.UnitedHealth Group Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks UnitedHealth Group Inc's profitability 10 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. UnitedHealth Group Inc's growth rank of 10 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and UnitedHealth Group Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. UnitedHealth Group Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 10.80% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 61.11% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, UnitedHealth Group Inc's earnings increased by approximately 13.90% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 25% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 14.40%, which underperforms than approximately 30% of global competitors.Concluding ThoughtsDespite the underperformance in certain growth metrics, UnitedHealth Group Inc's strong dividend history, consistent growth in dividend payments, and low payout ratio suggest a sustainable dividend model. The company's high profitability rank and robust growth rank further signal a positive outlook. However, investors should continue to monitor the company's revenue and earnings growth rates to ensure the sustainability of future dividends.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

The company’s focus on productivity and cost-saving plans positions it to drive margins in the future. Continued business investments also bode well.Procter &amp; Gamble continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the fourth consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023. Sales and earnings also improved year over year. PG’s core earnings increased 13% year over year and currency-neutral EPS growth of 22%. The strong bottom-line results have stemmed from improved sales, higher operating margin and lower shares outstanding.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 9.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 6.7%. The stock also compared favorably against the Consumer Staples sector’s decline of 4.6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 4.5% and 8.3%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Working Well for PG?Procter &amp; Gamble’s products play a key role in meeting consumers' daily health, hygiene and cleaning needs. The company witnessed a continued strong momentum in the fiscal fourth quarter, as reflected by the underlying strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which aided organic sales growth.On an organic basis (excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues improved 8% in the fiscal fourth quarter, backed by a 7% rise in pricing and a 2% gain from a favorable product mix, offset by a 1% decline in volume. All the company’s business segments reported growth in organic sales.

Currency rates aided the operating margin by 1.2%. The operating margin expanded 310 bps to 21.5% on a currency-neutral basis.Story continuesThings to Watch OutProcter &amp; Gamble has been witnessing elevated SG&amp;A expenses due to higher supply-chain costs, rising inflation, and elevated transportation expenses. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 190 bps from the year-ago quarter to 28.1% in the fiscal fourth quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, the SG&amp;A expense rate increased 140 bps to 27.6%, driven by 470 bps of marketing and overhead investments.Procter &amp; Gamble’s outlook for fiscal 2024 reflects supply-chain issues, higher transportation costs, geopolitical challenges, currency headwinds and rising inflation, which might impact consumer confidence.ConclusionSolid demand, brand strength and productivity efforts bode well and will likely help PG stay afloat despite cost headwinds and rising inflation.

In one of our articles, we referred to research by Columbia Business School to analyze the performance of high-yielding dividend stocks. According to the report, between January 2000 and May 2010, the High Dividend Index showed an average yearly gain of 6.16%. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 had a decline of 4.75% during that time. In addition to this, Morgan Stanley conducted a study that looked at how high-dividend stocks performed during inflationary periods. The report mentioned these stocks typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. The report also mentioned that their stability and dependable income make high-yielding stocks a relatively secure choice, especially appealing when economic conditions are uncertain.That said, not all dividends are the same. Going for the stock with the highest yield can be riskier. Analysts advise that investors should look for companies that are reliable and have a history of increasing their dividends each year. However, companies must use their funds wisely to sustain returns for their shareholders. Max Wasserman, founder and senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital, spoke with the Wall Street Journal about the payout ratios in his interview earlier this year. He said that a lot of the recent halts and reductions in dividend payments happened because companies made bad decisions about how they use their money. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Some companies have been stretching their balance sheets to remain dividend ‘aristocrats’ or to stay on the radar of mutual funds and dividend investors, and it’s hit their cash flows. With higher debt costs, inflation and uncertainty, they’ve made the decision to cut the dividend in response.”Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends consecutively for decades which shows that these companies have solid balance sheets with strong cash flows. In this article, we will explore dividend stocks with the highest yields.15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy TodayOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with yields ranging from 10% to 19%, as of September 7. The majority of these stocks belong to the REIT sector, as these companies are required to pay approximately 90% of their income to shareholders as a distribution. As these stocks have exceptionally high yields, a lot of the companies on the list don't have a consistent record of paying dividends. They've either stopped or reduced their dividend payments in 2020 due to the pandemic or because they were facing financial difficulties.15. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CALM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our bottom contributors in Q2 included Ashland and Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM). Cal-Maine Foods is the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the US. During Q2, wholesale commodities and caged egg prices normalized in the US, helped by the country having seemingly averted an avian flu outbreak — a combination which, though positive for the industry, pressured shares during the quarter. We maintain our positive outlook on Cal-Maine given the company’s significant investment in specialty and cage-free egg production, which we expect should benefit from a secular tailwind in the period ahead.”14.

These factors are likely to impede ZBRA’s earnings in the quarters ahead.Let’s discuss the factors that might continue taking a toll on this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company.Business Weakness: Weakness in the printing end market is affecting the Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment’s performance. Revenues from the unit declined 1.7% in the second quarter of 2023. Significant weakness in the mobile computing market has been weighing on the Enterprise Visibility &amp; Mobility segment, revenues from which declined 24.6% year over year in the second quarter of 2023.Softness in End Markets: Low demand across end markets, particularly in the retail and e-commerce and transportation logistics markets, is taking a toll on Zebra Technologies’ operations. Also, reduced consumer spending, thanks to interest rate hikes, has been weighing on the company’s operations. Due to these headwinds, as well as significant reduction in demand in the mobile computing market, Zebra Technologies has provided a bleak forecast for the third quarter of 2023 and the full year. For the third quarter, ZBRA expects a 30-35% drop in net sales from the year-ago reported quarter. For 2023, the company expects net sales to decline 20-23% from the year-ago period.Forex Woes: Given its widespread presence in international markets, Zebra Technologies is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. The foreign-currency translation had an adverse impact of 2.5% on sales in the first half of 2023. For the third quarter and the full year, the company expects a negative impact of 1 percentage point each from currency headwinds on its sales.Southbound Estimate Revisions: In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ZBRA’s 2023 earnings has been revised 30.3% downward.Price Performance: Shares of the company have declined 15.6% in the past year against the industry’s 5.1% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Industrial Products sector are discussed below:Caterpillar Inc.

Water infrastructure, like storage tanks and purifying units, needs maintenance at proper intervals.The repair and upgrade of other infrastructures like overhead storage tanks, treatment plants and water reservoirs are quite essential to providing uninterrupted 24x7 services to customers.Per the ASCE report, nearly 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost each day in the United States due to water main breaks every two minutes.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and high yields, and go directly to read 5 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy Today. The performance of high-yielding stocks can vary significantly over time and is influenced by various economic, market, and company-specific factors. In one of our articles, we referred to research by Columbia Business School to analyze the performance of high-yielding dividend stocks. According to the report, between January 2000 and May 2010, the High Dividend Index showed an average yearly gain of 6.16%. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 had a decline of 4.75% during that time. In addition to this, Morgan Stanley conducted a study that looked at how high-dividend stocks performed during inflationary periods. The report mentioned these stocks typically do well when inflation is higher than usual but on a downward trend. The report also mentioned that their stability and dependable income make high-yielding stocks a relatively secure choice, especially appealing when economic conditions are uncertain.That said, not all dividends are the same. Going for the stock with the highest yield can be riskier. Analysts advise that investors should look for companies that are reliable and have a history of increasing their dividends each year. However, companies must use their funds wisely to sustain returns for their shareholders. Max Wasserman, founder and senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital, spoke with the Wall Street Journal about the payout ratios in his interview earlier this year. He said that a lot of the recent halts and reductions in dividend payments happened because companies made bad decisions about how they use their money. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Some companies have been stretching their balance sheets to remain dividend ‘aristocrats’ or to stay on the radar of mutual funds and dividend investors, and it’s hit their cash flows. With higher debt costs, inflation and uncertainty, they’ve made the decision to cut the dividend in response.”Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have raised their dividends consecutively for decades which shows that these companies have solid balance sheets with strong cash flows. In this article, we will explore dividend stocks with the highest yields.15 Highest Yielding Dividend Stocks You Can Buy TodayOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with yields ranging from 10% to 19%, as of September 7. The majority of these stocks belong to the REIT sector, as these companies are required to pay approximately 90% of their income to shareholders as a distribution. As these stocks have exceptionally high yields, a lot of the companies on the list don't have a consistent record of paying dividends. They've either stopped or reduced their dividend payments in 2020 due to the pandemic or because they were facing financial difficulties.15. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM)Dividend Yield as of September 7: 10.84%Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) is an American company that specializes in the production and marketing of shell eggs.

(NASDAQ:CALM) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our bottom contributors in Q2 included Ashland and Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM). Cal-Maine Foods is the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the US. During Q2, wholesale commodities and caged egg prices normalized in the US, helped by the country having seemingly averted an avian flu outbreak — a combination which, though positive for the industry, pressured shares during the quarter. We maintain our positive outlook on Cal-Maine given the company’s significant investment in specialty and cage-free egg production, which we expect should benefit from a secular tailwind in the period ahead.”14.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's 5 Activist Targets.Nelson Peltz is a popular name when it comes to activism on Wall Street. The billionaire investor has made a name for himself by serving several boards and pushing for drastic changes to unlock shareholder value. He helped cofound Trian Partners, a hedge fund focused on investing in high-quality but highly undervalued and underperforming public companies.Although Peltz is consistently open to cooperative efforts with management teams and boards to unlock value, he is not hesitant to initiate proxy battles when necessary. An average return of 38.12% since 2013 underscores why he is a revered activist investor on Wall Street.At the height of the bear run in 2022, Trian Partners was down by 10.6%, outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which ended the year down 19%. Trian's performance was much better, considering on average hedge funds lost 17.2% in 2022.As an activist investor, Peltz often lobbies for changes within companies he is engaged in proxy battles. For starters, he may push for higher dividends, share buybacks, cost cuts, and management changes. He may sometimes push for company dissolution or the sale of some units. After acquiring a $1.3 billion stake in PepsiCo Company in 2013, he called the CEO and demanded the company acquire Mondelez International, a company in which he owned $1 billion in stakes.After acquiring a 9.9% stake in asset manager Invesco and Janus Henderson in 2020, the activist investor pushed for a merger for the two companies. While the deal never materialized, he succeeded in turning Invesco's fortune around, with its operating margins and earnings more than doubling. While Janus did underperform, Peltz continued to ramp up stakes, becoming its largest shareholder after that.Story continuesIn the most recent past, Peltz has waged a proxy battle with Disney after formally launching a bid for a board seat. The activist investor insists he wants to rescue the company from what he calls a crisis of overspending on the streaming business, the purchase of 21st Century Fox, and failed succession planning. Peltz's latest onslaught is seen as a serious challenge to Bob Iger, one of the most famous executives who returned from retirement to lead the company for a second time.Long Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist TargetsNelson Peltz of Trian PartnersOur methodologyPeltz's activist campaigns have generated an average of 9.6% over the past 15 years. While some campaigns have been extremely successful, generating returns of more than 30%, some have been a disappointment, losing as much as 15%, as was the case with General Electric.We have compiled a list of some of the top activist campaigns engineered by the billionaire investor since founding Trian Partners in 2005. The campaigns are ranked chronologically based on when they occurred.Long-Term Returns of Nelson Peltz's Activist Targets12.

The company also operates some of the biggest theme parks. The company saw a slew of activist investor activity in 2022, led by Peltz and Daniel Loeb.Peltz increased his stake in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in early 2023 in an attempt to gain sizable influence on the company's future roadmap. With his hedge fund Trian Partners, the activist investor was forced to end a proxy battle in February after Disney agreed to restructure its business and launch an effort to reduce costs by about $5.5 billion.With the changes, Peltz ended his quest for a board seat after CEO Iger laid out plans for cutting 7,000 jobs as part of the cost-cutting measures. The CEO has also agreed to consider the sale of the company's linear networks like ABC Freeform and National Geographic.10. Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ)Activist Investment: 2020 Long Term Returns Since Peltz's Investment: 142% S&amp;P 500 Gain Since Peltz's Investment: 45.38%Invesco Ltd.

Through Trian Partners, the hedge fund manager also encouraged Invesco Ltd. (NYSE:IVZ) to explore strategic combinations with one or more companies in asset management. Peltz wanted the company to merge with Janus, where he held some stakes.A proposed merger with Janus did not happen, and Peltz ended up stepping down from the board following his appointment to the Board of Janus Henderson Group.

He would exit the board four years later, terming his tenure successful in creating tremendous value for all stakeholders.8.

In the regulatory filing, the hedge fund reiterated that it could adopt a strategic and operating initiative to improve margins and enhance working capital efficiency.Days after the announcement, Peltz got his wish and was added to the company's board. With his addition to the board, the activist investor pushed for an increase in dividends, the repurchase of shares, and the divestment of non-core business.7. Mondelez International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) and PepsiCo. The reports came at a time when PepsiCo was in the process of exploring restructuring options for its underperforming North American beverage business. Speculation was rife that it could buy Mondelez.Peltz discussed with Mondelez management the company's operations capital structure and corporate governance. In early 2014, Mondelez announced Peltz was to join the board after criticizing the company for doing little to cut costs. He joined the board as part of a compromise agreement that resulted in him ending his push to have PepsiCo acquire Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ).Peltz continued to rack up stakes in the company until 2015 but left the board in 2016, reiterating satisfaction with the progress made at the confectionery company.6. PepsiCo, Inc.

The company was reviewing a potential spinoff of its beverage business, which remained a significant drag despite massive investments.In 2014, the activist investor renewed his struggle to force PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to spin-off the beverage unit from its flourishing snacks division.""Two leaner and more entrepreneurial companies"" through the spinoff would boost sales and margins in the snacks business, while the drinks business would generate a stable flow of cash that could be returned to shareholders, Peltz said.CEO Indra Nooyi shot down the spin-off efforts, insisting that a split up would hurt PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)'s ability to negotiate with retail customers. The feud only came to an end when PepsiCo agreed to allow a representative of Peltz's fund to join the board.Trian Partners exited its position in the beverage giant in 2016, three years after launching a campaign to have PepsiCo, Inc.

316,8e29729c-6383-391a-a445-57f7ad2b61ff,AMP,2023-09-09,Four Ways Life Insurance Can Grow and Protect Your Wealth,Kiplinger,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-ways-life-insurance-grow-093034437.html,1694251834,STORY,['AMP'],"[If you haven’t checked in on your life insurance strategy lately, now would be a good time to ensure you know how it can help beyond providing a death benefit.Life insurance applications surged following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a 38-year high in 2021, according to LIMRA. It’s no mystery why — the virus that tragically killed millions of people was a stark reminder of our mortality and the need to protect loved ones in the wake of our eventual passing.As the pandemic has eased, so too has the record-breaking wave of life insurance applications. Sales officially declined in January 2022, a mere two years since the start of the pandemic, according to LIMRA.This reversal — while understandable — could leave many investors without protections and income they’ll need later in life. While COVID may no longer be top of mind, it’s important to keep sight on the wide array of benefits life insurance can provide. If it’s been a while since you’ve reviewed your life insurance strategy, it may be time for a refresher. Here are some factors to keep in mind.The primary purpose of life insurance is to protect those who matter most to you following your death. While it’s emotional to think about, planning for the unexpected events in life is critical if you have a spouse, children or other loved ones who depend on your earned income. A payout from life insurance, called a death benefit, supplies essential cash flow to replace lost income, helping your beneficiaries maintain their standard of living and stay on track for goals — such as going to college or retiring — that you planned for together.Life insurance is not a “set it and forget it” strategy. As your life becomes more complex — with events like marriage, the birth of a child and growth in your income and estate — your life insurance needs will likely evolve. It’s important to regularly review the terms of your policies and ensure you have the right amount of coverage to support your beneficiaries’ income needs should you pass away.Story continuesIf you’re a stay-at-home parent, or if you do not have a spouse or any dependents, you still have reasons to consider acquiring life insurance. Think about the financial impact — everything from childcare costs to funeral expenses — that could befall your loved ones if you were to pass away unexpectedly.Life insurance offers liquidity to apply to major financial goals. Your circumstances and goals will likely change over time, and many policies offer the potential to accumulate cash value you can borrow against while you’re still living to apply to key needs. Whether it’s starting a new business, embarking on a passion project or paying for a child’s or grandchild’s education, the cash value accumulated within a life insurance policy can provide the financial resources needed to turn these dreams into reality. The funds can also be used in emergencies, giving you peace of mind that you have another source of income to handle the “what-ifs” that pop up in life.This additional source of liquidity is particularly effective for clients who may not qualify for Roth accounts or have already maximized 401(k) contributions. By leveraging the cash value option in life insurance, individuals have the flexibility to withdraw cash without incurring penalties before age 59½, and they can pay themselves back at 0% interest, making it an attractive option for higher-income earners who are conscious of tax implications.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently reported that 70% of people in the U.S. population turning 65 today will need some type of nursing home or home care service in their remaining years. While no one wants to think about whether they’ll need chronic care, this statistic illustrates how imperative it is to prepare for the possibility.An insurance policy with long-term care provisions provides a predictable stream of income you or your spouse can use to fund care. Many policies offer riders or options that allow policyholders to access a portion of their death benefit while still alive to cover chronic care expenses. Upon your death, any unused benefit is inherited by your beneficiaries.You may also consider a hybrid life insurance policy that balances various chronic care considerations with traditional life insurance benefits. The right options and coverage amount for you will depend on your financial situation and heath needs. A financial adviser can help you assess the choices and costs.The benefit is this strategy allows you to preserve your retirement assets and avoid relying on government assistance from Medicare or Medicaid. Instead of being funneled to pay for care, you can use your savings for other essential and lifestyle expenses in retirement — or to leave as a legacy for your family.Life insurance plays an integral role in allowing you to leave behind a meaningful financial inheritance for your heirs, helping ensure they’re well cared for even in your absence. Whether it’s providing for grandchildren’s education, supporting charitable causes, preserving family assets or another goal, life insurance offers flexibility and liquidity to your heirs.Using a life insurance policy to transfer your wealth has three distinct benefits:Life insurance is personal, and your strategy for leveraging your policy should be, too. Consult a financial adviser for guidance on implementing the best solutions for you. A professional can review your financial circumstances, coverage needs and legacy goals to help you determine how to protect the people in your life you care about most.Third party companies mentioned are not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates do not offer tax or legal advice.
