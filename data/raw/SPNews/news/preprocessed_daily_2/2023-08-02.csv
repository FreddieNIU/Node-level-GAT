Adjusted EBITDA growth reflects the contribution from strong revenue growth combined with cost discipline across our businesses.Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations (diluted EPS) were $1.35 for the second quarter of 2023, up 8.9%. Diluted adjusted earnings per share (diluted adjusted EPS), a non-GAAP measure, were $1.51, up 18.9%. Diluted adjusted EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program.Net cash provided by operating activities was $192.9 million, up 48.2% and free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, was $134.7 million, up 120.8% for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an increase in operating profit, and a decrease of $75.2 million in cash taxes paid. The decrease in tax payments was primarily related to the non-recurring gain on the disposition of 3E in the prior year, offset by an increase in taxable income in the second quarter of 2023. The operating cash flows for the prior year has not been adjusted to separately disclose the cash flows related to discontinued operations.We paid a cash dividend of 34 cents per share on June 30, 2023. Our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of 34 cents per share payable on September 29, 2023.We are increasing our financial guidance for 2023 given the strong performance to date.Story continuesJERSEY CITY, N.J., Aug. 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verisk (Nasdaq: VRSK), a leading global data analytics and technology provider, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.Lee Shavel, president and CEO, Verisk: ""I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong second-quarter financial results, which illustrate the power of our integrated organization, focus on the insurance industry, and results-oriented culture.

This includes, but is not limited to, our expectation and ability to pay a cash dividend on our common stock in the future, subject to the determination by our Board of Directors and based on an evaluation of our earnings, financial condition and requirements, business conditions, capital allocation determinations, and other factors, risks, and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “target,” “seek,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond our control and that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.Other factors that could materially affect actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements can be found in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this release reflects our current views with respect to future events and is subject to these and other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy, and liquidity. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.Notes Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as supplemental information regarding our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe that our presentation of non-GAAP measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our management uses these measures for reviewing our financial results, for budgeting and planning purposes, and for evaluating the performance of senior management.EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses: EBITDA represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization of fixed assets; (ii) amortization of intangible assets; (iii) interest expense, net; and (iv) provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss. Adjusted EBITDA expenses represent adjusted EBITDA net of revenues. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they help us allocate resources, make business decisions, allow for greater transparency regarding our operating performance, and facilitate period-to-period comparison.Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Adjusted EPS: Adjusted net income represents GAAP net income adjusted for (i) amortization of intangible assets, net of tax; (ii) acquisition-related costs (earn-outs), net of tax; (iii) gain/loss from dispositions (which includes businesses held for sale), net of tax; and (iv) nonrecurring gain/loss, net of tax. Diluted adjusted EPS represents adjusted net income divided by weighted-average diluted shares. We believe these measures are useful and meaningful because they allow evaluation of the after-tax profitability of our results excluding the after-tax effect of acquisition-related costs and nonrecurring items.Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP minus payments for capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of the recurring cash generated by our operations that may be available to repay debt obligations, repurchase our stock, invest in future growth through new business development activities, or make acquisitions.Organic: Organic is defined as operating results excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and dispositions (which include businesses held for sale), and nonrecurring gain/loss associated with cost-based and equity-method investments that have occurred over the past year. An acquisition is included as organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter that occurs subsequent to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition date. Once an acquisition is included in its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also included to calculate organic growth. A disposition (which includes a business held for sale) is excluded from organic at the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the disposition occurs (or when a business meets the held-for-sale criteria under U.S. GAAP). Once a disposition is excluded from its current-period organic base, its comparable prior-year-period operating results are also excluded to calculate organic growth. We believe the organic presentation enables investors to assess the growth of the business without the impact of recent acquisitions for which there is no prior-year comparison and the impact of recent dispositions, for which results are removed from all prior periods presented to allow for comparability.Organic Constant Currency (OCC) Growth Rate: Our operating results, such as, but not limited to, revenue and adjusted EBITDA, reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact changes in value over time compared with the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to assess how we performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating comparable prior-year-period results at the currency exchange rates used in the current period. We believe organic constant currency is a useful and meaningful measure to enhance investors’ understanding of the continuing operating performance of our business and to facilitate the comparison of period-to-period performance because it excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, acquisitions, and dispositions.See page 10 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and a segment results summary and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. See page 11 for a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBITDA margin, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA expenses, and a reconciliation of diluted adjusted EPS. See page 12 for a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.We are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.Attached

However, their dominance presents challenges for emerging companies striving to differentiate themselves. This has led to the rise of the best tech stocks to buy.One area presenting immense potential for growth and investor interest is Generative AI. This rapidly advancing field holds promising prospects as its technology continues to mature, becoming increasingly applicable in a broad range of industries. Notably, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a leading player in the field, has been developing AI-accelerated chips that maximize the potential of applications like ChatGPT.Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry, integral to nearly every tech-enabled product, from cars to washing machines, continues to thrive as one of the largest sectors in the tech industry. In the following discussion, we will delve into two semiconductor companies: one an established giant, the other a smaller international entity boasting an impressive dividend yield.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLastly, we’ll explore a burgeoning Bitcoin (BTC:USD) mining company that’s expanding its production potential through environmentally conscious methods, illustrating the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency mining.United Microelectronics (UMC)Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.Source: ShutterstockUnited Microelectronics (NYSE:UMC) operates as a dedicated semiconductor wafer foundry company based in Taiwan. United Microelectronics produces silicon wafers that provide integrated circuits for semiconductors and other electronic products. They have 12 different facilities located throughout Asia that produce approximately 850,000 wafers per month. This makes it one of those best tech stocks to buy.The company reported first-quarter earnings back in April. Their net income fell by 18%, and total revenue dropped by 15% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Shrinking demand for silicon wafers due to inflated inventory levels led to a drop in overall profit. And the company also stated that it expects the continued demand shortage for semiconductors products to will affect second-quarter earnings. United Microelectronics has been implementing cost-cutting measures to help offset revenue stagnation.Story continuesThey also offer a dividend yield of approximately 8% on an annual basis, with $0.14 per share being paid to shareholders quarterly.CleanSpark (CLSK)Black handcuffs laid next to Bitcoin on black slate background symbolizing crypto law and crypto-related arrestSource: shutterstock.com/spaxiaxCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) is a Bitcoin mining company that provides sustainable infrastructure for mining operations through low-emission energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear. They are based in Henderson, Nevada. And the stock price year-to-date is up by over 205%, mainly to the increase in the price of Bitcoin, which has surged by more than 75% since the beginning of the year.Cleanspark just recently acquired two Bitcoin mining campuses located in Dalton, Georgia, in an all-cash deal worth $9.3 million. It was stated in their most recent Bitcoin mining update that the company mined 491 Bitcoin worth approximately $13 million. The company reached phase two for its mining campus in Georgia, in which it is increasing its computing power, also known as hash rate, to 8.5 exahashes per second which is over halfway towards there target for the end of the year.Texas Instruments (TXN)Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comTexas Instrumental (NASDAQ:TXN) is a global semiconductor company based out of Dallas, Texas. They provide chips for many industries, such as automotive, industrial, and personal electronics.In February, the company announced plans to build an addition to its 300 mm wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah. This represents an $11 billion investment, the most significant economic investment in all of Utah’s history. And it’s expected to add over 800 new jobs and thousands of indirect jobs to the area.In April, Haviv Ilan became the new President and CEO of Texas Instruments, and the previous CEO, Rich Templeton, will remain as Chairman. This is another reason why TXN is one of those best tech stocks.The company released second-quarter earnings on July 25. Net income fell by 25%, and total revenue declined by 13%. Similar to United Microelectronics and other semiconductors companies, Texas Instruments experienced weakness in the market, leading to a decrease in profits.On the date of publication, Noah Bolton did have a long position in UMC.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Western Digital The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$241.4mUS$1.20bUS$1.53bUS$1.64bUS$1.73bUS$1.80bUS$1.86bUS$1.92bUS$1.98bUS$2.03bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.08%Est @ 4.19%Est @ 3.56%Est @ 3.13%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% -US$217US$974US$1.1kUS$1.1kUS$1.0kUS$957US$892US$828US$766US$708(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.1bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.0b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (11%– 2.1%) = US$23bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$23b÷ ( 1 + 11%)10= US$8.0bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$16b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$42.9, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Western Digital as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.512. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Western DigitalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessShareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityForecast to reduce losses next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

This compares to earnings of $1.91 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10.16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurance company would post earnings of $1.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.87, delivering a surprise of 13.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Unum , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, posted revenues of $3.11 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.41%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.05 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Unum shares have added about 18.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.5%.What's Next for Unum?While Unum has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Unum: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of investment gains and losses, amortization of cost of reinsurance, and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance.  Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives.  These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for income before income tax or net income.Unum US SegmentUnum US reported adjusted operating income of $343.1 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 17.5 percent from $291.9 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Premium income increased 4.5 percent to $1,641.4 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $1,571.0 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Net investment income decreased 5.8 percent to $158.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $167.8 million in the second quarter of 2022.Within the Unum US operating segment, the group disability line of business reported a 51.5 percent increase in adjusted operating income to $159.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $105.5 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Premium income for the group disability line of business increased 9.3 percent to $772.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $706.5 million in the second quarter of 2022, driven by in-force block growth and higher sales, partially offset by lower persistency in the group short-term disability product line.  Net investment income decreased 7.3 percent to $81.1 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $87.5 million in the second quarter of 2022, due to a decrease in the level of invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income.  The benefit ratio for the second quarter of 2023 was 59.4 percent, compared to 66.7 percent in the second quarter of 2022, due to lower claim incidence in our group long-term disability product line and favorable discount rate impacts on new claims.  Group long-term disability sales were $65.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 3.8 percent from $63.2 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Group short-term disability sales were $49.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 36.6 percent from $36.3 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Persistency in the group long-term disability product line was 91.0 percent for the first half of 2023, compared to 90.9 percent for the first half of 2022.

dismemberment line of business reported a 20.2 percent decrease in adjusted operating income to $51.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $64.7 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Premium income for this line of business was $461.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, which was generally consistent to the $463.4 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Net investment income decreased 12.0 percent to $21.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $24.9 million in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a decrease in the level of invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income.  The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2023 was 73.0 percent, compared to 70.8 percent in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to higher incidence in both the group life and accidental death and dismemberment product lines, partially offset by lower average claim size in the group life product line.  Sales of group life and accidental death and dismemberment products increased 15.1 percent in the second quarter of 2023 to $88.6 million, compared to $77.0 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Persistency in the group life product line was

second quarter of 2023, compared to $401.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, with higher sales in the individual disability product line, partially offset by lower persistency in the voluntary benefits and dental and vision product lines.  Net investment income decreased 0.7 percent to $55.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $55.4 million in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to a decline in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.  The benefit ratio for the voluntary benefits product line was 39.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 42.4 percent in the second quarter of 2022, due to favorable reserve development and increased lapses.  The benefit ratio for the individual disability product line was 42.1 percent for the second quarter of 2023, compared to 50.3 percent in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to higher mortality.  The benefit ratio for the dental and vision product line was 76.2 percent for the second quarter of 2023, compared to 72.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to higher average claim size and higher claim incidence.  Relative to the second quarter of 2022, sales in the voluntary benefits product line increased 15.9 percent in the second quarter of 2023 to $62.6 million.  Sales in the individual disability product line increased 53.5 percent in the second quarter of 2023 to $28.7 million.  Sales in the dental and vision product line increased 51.2 percent in the second quarter of 2023 to $19.5 million.  Persistency in the voluntary benefits product line was 74.4 percent for the first half of 2023, compared to 75.8 percent for the first half of 2022.  Persistency in the

million in the second quarter of 2022.  Net investment income decreased  9.8 percent to $45.8 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Sales

currency, of £34.3 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 59.5 percent from £21.5 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Premium income was £143.1 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 14.5 percent from £125.0 million in the second quarter of 2022, due to in-force block growth and higher sales.  Net investment income was £34.5 million in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 12.0 percent from £39.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, due to lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds.  The benefit ratio in the second quarter of 2023 was 72.3 percent, compared to 87.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, due to favorable claim resolutions primarily driven by higher mortality and higher discount rates on new claims in the group long-term disability product line, and lower inflation-linked experience in benefits, partially offset by higher mortality in the group life product line.  Sales increased 64.3 percent to £41.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to £25.5 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Persistency in the group long-term disability product line was 90.9 percent for the first half of 2023,

operating income of $115.5 million in the second quarter of 2023, a 19.6 percent increase compared to $96.6 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Premium income increased to $430.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $427.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, due to higher sales in prior periods, partially offset by lower persistency.  Net investment income decreased to $38.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $38.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to lower miscellaneous investment income.  The benefit ratio was 48.3 percent in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 53.8 percent in the second quarter of 2022, and was favorable across all product lines primarily due to lower claim costs in the accident, sickness and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines.  Sales increased 3.2 percent to $122.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $118.2 million in the second quarter of 2022.  Persistency in the Colonial Life segment was 77.5 percent for the first half of 2023, compared to 78.6 percent for the first half of 2022.Closed Block SegmentThe Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $51.2 million in the second quarter of 2023, which excludes the amortization of cost of reinsurance of $11.0 million and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance of $9.9 million related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction, compared to $86.9 million in the second quarter of 2022, which excludes the amortization of cost of reinsurance of $13.3 million and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance of $10.0 million related to the Closed Block individual disability reinsurance transaction.  Premium income for this segment is largely driven by our long-term care product line, and in the second quarter of 2023, premium income for long-term care was generally consistent with the same period of 2022.  Net investment income decreased 9.5 percent to $263.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to $291.5 million in the second quarter of 2022, due to lower miscellaneous investment income, primarily related to smaller increases in the net asset values on our private equity partnerships, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.The interest adjusted loss ratio for the long-term care line of business was 92.4 percent in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an interest adjusted loss ratio of 84.9 percent in the second quarter of 2022, driven primarily by higher claim incidence.  The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care for the rolling twelve months ended June 30, 2023 was 86.6 percent.Corporate SegmentThe Corporate segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $34.9 million in the second quarter of 2023, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $36.9 million in the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to increased net investment income, which was driven by an increase in yield on invested assets, partially offset by higher pension expenses.OTHER INFORMATIONShares OutstandingThe Company's weighted average number of shares outstanding, assuming dilution, was 198.1

when comparing historically reported 2022 results, or an increase of 10 percent to 15 percent on a consistent basis under ASU 2018-12.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESWe analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures.  A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP financial measure of ""after-tax adjusted operating income"" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of investment gains or losses, the amortization of the cost of reinsurance, and the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance as specified in the reconciliations in the Financial Highlights section below.  Investment gains or losses primarily include realized investment gains or losses, expected investment credit losses, and gains or losses on derivatives.  We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business.Investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments.  Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of investment gains or losses.  Although we may experience investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities.We exited a substantial portion of our Closed Block individual disability product line through the two phases of the reinsurance transaction that were executed in December 2020 and March 2021.  As a result, we exclude the amortization of the cost of reinsurance that we recognized upon the exit of the business related to the policies on claim status as well as the impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance that resulted from the adoption of ASU 2018-12.  Due to the execution of the second phase of the reinsurance transaction occurring after January 1, 2021, the transition date of ASU 2018-12, in accordance with the provisions of the ASU related to non-contemporaneous reinsurance, we were required to establish the ceded reserves using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument as of the reinsurance transaction date in March 2021, which resulted in higher ceded reserves compared to that which was reported historically.  However, the direct reserves for the block reinsured in the second phase were calculated using the original discount rate utilized as of the transition date.  Both the direct and ceded reserves are then remeasured at each reporting period using a current discount rate reflective of an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument, with the changes recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).  While the total equity impact is neutral, the different original discount rates utilized for direct and ceded reserves result in disproportionate earnings impacts.  The impact of non-contemporaneous reinsurance will fluctuate depending on the magnitude of reserve changes during the period.  We believe that the exclusion of these items provides a better view of our results from our ongoing businesses.We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability.CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION Members of Unum Group senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss the results of

QRVO is scheduled to report its first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on Aug 2, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 116.67%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 36.08%, on average.Despite a focus on innovation and portfolio expansion, the leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions is expected to report lower revenues year over year. Soft demand trends in various end markets, geopolitical volatility and stiff competition are likely to impact the top line.Factors at PlayIn the fiscal first quarter, Qorvo extended the 5G base station product family with the introduction of next-generation power amplifier modules. These 5G modules provide optimal solutions for mMIMO (massive MIMO) wireless systems that minimize cost and maximize performance with ease of use and enhanced capacity. The solution suite includes QPB9362, a highly integrated front-end low-noise amplifier module designed primarily for the 5G Time Division Duplex system. The QPB3810 is integrated with bias control for 5G mMIMO applications. These developments are likely to have cushioned the top line.In the quarter under review, Qorvo unveiled three best-in-class solid-state power amplifiers, the QPB2040N, QPB0220N and QPB0618N. These amplifiers are part of Qorvo's cutting-edge Spatium SSPA portfolio and cater to a wide range of applications in both commercial and defense communications, radar, electronic warfare and other wideband uses. Additionally, Qorvo introduced the QPF0219, the world's first front-end power module operating at a frequency range of 2-18 GHz. This module incorporates state-of-the-art semiconductor technology that ensures optimum performance in challenging radar applications.During the quarter, Qorvo launched new features in its industry-leading 1.8 GHz DOCSIS 4.0 product portfolio. The newly introduced QPA3314 hybrid power double amplifier offers more RF power at a lower DC power than any other cable equipment solutions and ensures superior return loss performance with low noise and greater reliability. With over 30 products, Qorvo boasts the most comprehensive DOCSIS 4.0 product line in the industry. This includes high-output power doubles, drivers, pre-amps, return amps, VCA, DSA, switches and voltage variable equalizers. This is expected to have a positive impact on the company’s fiscal first-quarter performance.However, Qorvo operates in a highly competitive industry with a low barrier to entry. This puts intense pressure on pricing and market share, which negatively affects profitability.Weak demand trends in several end markets and dependence on a few key customers are major concerns. Rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China is also likely to have hurt its operations. These factors are expected to hurt the top line.Per the Zacks consensus estimate, net sales in High-Performance Analog are expected to be $146.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenues from Advance Cellular are projected at $406 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Connectivity and Sensors Group is expected to generate $87.5 million in revenues.For the June quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $640 million, indicating a decline from $1,035 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at 15 cents per share. It reported earnings of $2.25 per share in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Qorvo this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

FNKO is set to report second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug 3, after market close. The bottom line of this lifestyle pop culture products company is expected to have decreased year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 38 cents per share for the second quarter has been stable in the past 30 days. The figure shows a decline from earnings of 26 cents per share in the year-ago period.The consensus estimate for quarterly revenues stands at $253.2 million, indicating a decrease of 19.8% from the prior-year reported figure.The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49%, on average. In the last reported quarter, the company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a margin of 46.7%.Key Things to NoteFunko’s second-quarter results are likely to reflect the impacts of a tough operating backdrop, including inflationary pressures. In addition, currency headwinds are expected to remain deterrents. Further, supply-chain disruptions are likely to have affected the company’s performance in the second quarter. These weaknesses, coupled with any deleverage in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, are expected to have hurt Funko’s performance in the quarter under review. The company has been witnessing higher SG&amp;A costs owing to the increased fulfillment expenses.On its last earnings call, management had projected net sales of $240-$260 million and adjusted EBITDA of a loss of $10 million to break even for the said quarter. However, the company had guided sequential gross margin improvement relative to the previous quarter’s adjusted gross margin and cited that SG&amp;A expenses are likely to remain in line with the first quarter.On the positive front, Funko has been focused on improving product categories, capacity-creation efforts and international expansion. Emphasis on direct-to-consumer channels through operational improvements is likely to have been a tailwind.  These, coupled with contributions from the Loungefly brand, are expected to have provided some cushion to the company’s performance in the second quarter.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Funko this time around.

Thermo Fisher and the estate's attorneys, Ben Crump and Chris Seeger, said in a statement that they were pleased with the settlement.The tissue sample that became the HeLa cell line was cut from Lacks' cervix at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore without her knowledge during surgery to treat her cervical cancer. Lacks died of the disease at age 31.The HeLa line, the first to survive and reproduce indefinitely in lab conditions, has since been used in a range of medical research worldwide, including to test the polio vaccine, research the effects of radiation on human cells, and develop a treatment for sickle-cell anemia.The lawsuit accused Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher of unjust enrichment, arguing it illegally commercialized Lacks' genetic material.""Black suffering has fueled innumerable medical progress and profit, without just compensation or recognition,"" the lawsuit said.The estate asked the court to disgorge Thermo Fisher's profit from commercializing HeLa cells and to block the company from using them without its permission.Thermo Fisher told the court that the lawsuit was brought too late and that the estate failed to outline a valid unjust enrichment claim.

HeLa cells went on to become a cornerstone of modern medicine, enabling countless scientific and medical innovations, including the development of the polio vaccine, genetic mapping and even COVID-19 vaccines.Despite that incalculable impact, the Lacks family had never been compensated.Lacks’ cells were harvested in 1951, when it was not illegal to do so without a patient’s permission. But lawyers for her family argued that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., of Waltham, Massachusetts, continued to commercialize the results long after the origins of the HeLa cell line became well known. The company unjustly enriched itself off Lacks’ cells, the family argued in their lawsuit, filed in 2021.The settlement came after closed-door negotiations that lasted all day Monday inside the federal courthouse in Baltimore. Some of Lacks’ grandchildren were among the family members who attended the talks.Attorney Ben Crump, who represents the family, announced the settlement late Monday and said the terms are confidential.In a joint statement, Thermo Fisher representatives and attorneys for the Lacks family said they were pleased to resolve the matter and declined to comment further on the agreement.A poor tobacco farmer from southern Virginia, Lacks got married and moved with her husband to Turner Station, a historically Black community outside Baltimore. They were raising five children when doctors discovered a tumor in Lacks’ cervix and saved a sample of her cancer cells collected during a biopsy.Story continuesLacks died at age 31 in the “colored ward” of Johns Hopkins Hospital. She was buried in an unmarked grave.While most cell samples died shortly after being removed from the body, her cells survived and thrived in laboratories. They became known as the first immortalized human cell line because scientists could cultivate them indefinitely, meaning researchers anywhere could reproduce studies using identical cells.The remarkable science involved — and the impact on the Lacks family, some of whom had chronic illnesses and no health insurance — were documented in a bestselling book by Rebecca Skloot, “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,” which was published in 2010. Oprah Winfrey portrayed her daughter in an HBO movie about the story.Johns Hopkins said it never sold or profited from the cell lines, but many companies have patented ways of using them.In their complaint, Lacks’ descendants argued that her treatment illustrates a much larger issue that persists today: racism inside the U.S. medical system.“The exploitation of Henrietta Lacks represents the unfortunately common struggle experienced by Black people throughout history,” the complaint reads.In a brief filed in support of the Lacks family, attorneys advocating for civil rights, women’s rights and health care equity said the case is one of many in which U.S. doctors and scientists have exploited minority patients. Another example they cited involved James Marion Sims, a 19th century Alabama surgeon heralded as the father of modern gynecology who performed experimental surgeries on a dozen enslaved women without the use of anesthesia, claiming Black people could endure more pain than white people.“Indeed, a great portion of early American medical research is founded upon nonconsensual experimentation upon systemically oppressed people,” the attorneys wrote.In another supporting brief, Southern University law professor Deleso Alford highlighted the discrepancy in status and financial stability between Lacks’ descendants, including grandson Ron Lacks who wrote a book in 2020, and the medical professionals profiting off her cells.“In the same year Mr. Lacks was self-publishing a book in the hopes of finding some help for his family, the CEO of Thermo Fisher received a compensation package of over $26 million,” the brief says.Thermo Fisher argued the case should be dismissed because it was filed after the statute of limitations expire. But lawyers for the Lacks family said that shouldn’t apply because the company is continuously benefiting.In a statement posted online, Johns Hopkins Medicine officials said they reviewed all interactions with Lacks and her family after the publication of Skloot’s book. While acknowledging an ethical responsibility, the statement said the medical system “has never sold or profited from the discovery or distribution of HeLa cells and does not own the rights to the HeLa cell line.”Though her relatives hadn’t received financial compensation, they reached an agreement with the National Institutes of Health in 2013 that gave them some control over how the DNA code from HeLa cells is used.Crump, a civil rights attorney, has become well known for representing victims of police violence and calling for racial justice, especially in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. The Lacks family joined him Tuesday near Baltimore’s waterfront to announce the settlement and pay tribute to Lacks on what would have been her 103rd birthday. The group brought balloons and a cake to celebrate.Lacks’ only surviving child, Lawrence Lacks Sr., lives to see justice done, grandson Alfred Lacks Carter Jr. said. Now 86, Lawrence Lacks was 16 when his mother died.“There couldn’t have been a more fitting day for her to have justice, for her family to have relief,” Carter said. “It was a long fight — over 70 years — and Henrietta Lacks gets her day.”]"

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$94.33 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$81.41. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Edwards Lifesciences' current trading price of US$82.07 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Edwards Lifesciences’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences What Is Edwards Lifesciences Worth?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 31%, trading at US$82.07 compared to my intrinsic value of $62.42. Not the best news for investors looking to buy! If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Edwards Lifesciences’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Edwards Lifesciences generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 38% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Edwards Lifesciences. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? EW’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe EW should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EW for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for EW, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

Overall, the index has risen almost 16% as it enters the third quarter of this year. In addition to that, as we previously reported, the NASDAQ 100 Index has skyrocketed 40% in 2023, regardless of fears about a potential bubble. In 2023, technology stocks, growth stocks, and cryptocurrencies emerged as star performers, benefiting from renewed interest in risk assets. As we enter the second half of 2023, there are signs of inflation starting to cool off. Nonetheless, market experts are skeptical that the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation are not yet complete, and there is still a possibility of the US falling into recession.In 2023, Fidelity Investments expects some consumer staples firms to outperform. Ben Shuleva, Fidelity’s sector portfolio manager, commented at the end of December 2022: “In 2023, many of the trends that emerged in 2022 will probably continue. However, consumers may be more sensitive to further price hikes than they were to previous price hikes—particularly if the economy softens further and the unemployment rate rises. Those best positioned for this backdrop may include companies that can raise prices further without losing sales volumes.”Don't Miss: Top 30 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index WeightSimilarly, precious metals like gold are considered to be safe haven assets against a backdrop riddled with inflation, devaluation of currency, and macroeconomic weakness. Eric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining UCITS ETF, told CNBC in December 2022: “Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022. It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.”Story continuesIn addition to that, Citibank analysts maintained an ""Overweight"" rating for the healthcare sector for 2023, setting aside concerns about the past year's strong performance. They emphasized the sector's defensive nature and held particular optimism about pharmaceuticals.Also Read: How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyAccording to NASDAQ’s “June, Mid-Year 2023 Review and Outlook” report, in the first half of 2023, 7 out of 11 sectors recorded gains, with Technology, Communications, and Discretionary sectors being market leaders. Technology stocks neared their previous all-time high from December 2021. While technology and growth sectors contributed significantly to the strong performance in the early months of this year, there was a noticeable shift towards cyclicals in June, possibly indicating an improvement in economic activity. All sectors ended June with positive returns. Industrials stood out with strong performance in June and continued momentum in early July, reaching new all-time highs. Housing also rebounded despite higher mortgage rates, driven by factors such as favorable demographics and migration patterns. These trends suggest positive prospects for the real estate sector as well. Some of the top stocks in the market include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc.

34,e3963f08-0e54-3ef5-b90e-d561cdb5f330,WMT,2023-08-02,Intuit and Tronox Holdings have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuit-tronox-holdings-highlighted-zacks-115300940.html,1690890780,STORY,"['TROX', 'INTU', 'WMT', 'ANF']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – August 1, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Intuit Inc.'s (INTU) as the Bull of the Day and Tronox Holdings plc TROX asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart Inc. WMT, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF and Ross Stores ROST.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Intuit Inc.'s portfolio of tax-focused software transformed the company into a Wall Street giant. The firm behind TurboTax and other financial services then spent the covid boom adding to its portfolio and diversifying into email marketing and beyond.INTU shares have surged 30% YTD and they just hit new 52-week highs on July 31. Yet, Intuit still trades roughly 25% below its all-time highs and its growth outlook remains solid and steady, driven by the never-ending need for digital tax help and other various software in our digital-everything world. Intuit's pitch is simple enough: Software and taxes are here to stay no matter what the future holds.Software Everyone Needs &amp; MoreIntuit might be best known for TurboTax, but it is much more than an online tax company. Intuit sells software geared toward accounting, small business money management, and more, including QuickBooks and Mint.Intuit bought Credit Karma in December 2020 and Mailchimp in November 2021. Alongside TurboTax, accounting, and other financial services, Inuit now provides email marketing, digital-ad services, customer-relationship-management tools, credit scores, and other personal financial services.Intuit boasts over 100 customers worldwide, and it grew its revenue between 11% and 32% for seven years running—the 32% came in fiscal 2022 (up 24% excluding Mailchimp). INTU has expanded its sales from under $4 billion in fiscal 2013 to $12.73 billion in FY22 (period ended on July 31, 2022).Intuit also managed to post a nice string of big bottom-line growth for an extended period of time. Most recently, the tech firm beat our Q3 FY23 EPS estimate in late May and raised its full-year guidance.Story continuesNear-Term Outlook Intuit's FY23 revenue (period ended on July 31) is projected to climb by over 12% to jump from $12.73 billion to $14.30 billion, based on the most recent Zacks data. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 20% YoY to $14.22 a share. INTU's Q4 sales are set to pop by 9.4% to boost its earnings by 25%.Peeking ahead to INTU's fiscal 2024, the company is projected to post 11% higher revenue and 9% stronger adjusted earnings. Intuit has topped our quarterly EPS estimates by an average of 28% in the trailing four quarters, with only one bottom line miss in the past five years. And its positive earnings revisions help Intuit land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Performance and Valuation Intuit stock has skyrocketed roughly 2,100% over the last 20 years to blow away the Zacks tech sector's 515%. INTU also more than doubled the tech space during the trailing decade, soaring 700%. The tax software stock continued its outperformance over the past three years as well, up 64% vs. 35%.The stock's significant outperformance came even though it has roughly matched the tech space over the last two years, with INTU down around 4%. Intuit has, however, lagged the broader Zacks tech sector so far this year, up 31% vs. 43%. Thankfully, INTU has picked up some momentum recently, surging 13% in the last month to hit new 52-week highs on the last day of July.Despite the climb, Intuit still trades roughly 25% below its all-time highs. Plus, INTU trades solidly above its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. The stock also jumped back above its 50-week moving average earlier this year, following its 2022 tumble and it found support there in early June.Intuit is hardly a value stock, trading at 50.1X forward 12-month earnings. But this marks a 40% discount to its own 10-year highs. The stock's PEG ratio, which factors in its growth outlook, also showcases around 40% value vs. its decade-long high at 3.3.Bottom Line Intuit's balance sheet is solid even though it made two big acquisitions over the last several years. The company also pays a dividend (yielding 0.6% right now) that it has raised by 14% annualized over the last five years. And the company has $2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase program.Wall Street is high on the stock, with 19 of the 22 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Intuit sitting at ""Strong Buys."" This makes sense given INTU's long history of growth in a critical, hard-to-cut-back-on area such as taxes, coupled with its expansion into new areas of business and personal finance software.Intuit is set to release its Q4 and full-year fiscal 2023 financial results on August 24.Bear of the Day:Tronox Holdings plc. is one of the leading producers of high-quality titanium products. Tronox's earnings outlook started fading quickly last year.Tronox fell short of our second quarter earnings estimates by a wide margin on July 26. TROX's EPS outlook has slipped even further since its big miss and disappointing outlook.The Tronox Basics Tronox mines and processes titanium ore, zircon, and other minerals. Tronox also manufactures titanium dioxide pigments that help add brightness and durability to paints, plastics, paper, and other everyday products.Tronox capped off a nice stretch of revenue growth between fiscal 2017 and 2021, with 30% sales expansion in FY21. Tronox's revenue then slipped 3% YoY in 2022 against that tough to compete-against-stretch. Tronox on July 26 fell short of both our adjusted earnings and revenue estimates for Q2 FY23.The firm's adjusted Q2 earnings tumbled 81% YoY to $0.16 a share, which missed our estimate by 41%. Tronox's earnings outlook took another hit following its release.Zacks estimates currently call for TROX's sales to slide 8.7% in FY23. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to fall 47% YoY in 2023.TROX's FY23 consensus estimate has dropped 27% over the last two months, with FY24's estimate 19% lower. And its most recent/most accurate estimates came in far lower. Tronox's downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Bottom LineTronox stock is down roughly 40% over the last decade vs. the Zacks Basic Materials sector's 22% climb. This run included some huge swings, with TROX shares down roughly 45% from their 2021 highs.TROX stock has fallen 3% in 2023, including a significant fall since its Q2 release to take it back under its 21-day moving average. Tronox shares also slipped back below their 50-week moving average after being rejected by their 200-week not too long ago.Tronox is part of the Chemical – Diversified industry that currently ranks in the bottom 12% of over 250 Zacks industries. And it might be best for investors to stay away from Tronox at the moment and look elsewhere for winners.Additional content:Walmart's (WMT) Additional Stake in Flipkart to Fuel e-Commerce?Walmart Inc. has been making successive efforts to strengthen its e-commerce operations in the United States and internationally.

(NYSE: XYL), a leading global water technology company dedicated to solving the world’s most challenging water issues, today reported second-quarter results, which include the May 24 acquisition of Evoqua Water Technologies Corp. (Evoqua). The Company reported total revenue of $1.7 billion, with reported growth of 26 percent and organic growth of 15 percent, surpassing prior guidance, on strong commercial and operational execution. Orders were up 10 percent on a reported basis and down 2 percent organically, while backlog grew to $5.3 billion, up 7 percent organically and including $1.3 billion from Evoqua, with resilient underlying demand. Second-quarter earnings, excluding the acquisition, exceeded Xylem’s previous stand-alone guidance.""This past quarter, we took another transformative step as a leading water solutions company to help our communities and customers solve the greatest water challenges facing our society and economies: water scarcity, resilience of our infrastructure to climate change, and the need to address these challenges affordably with the power of technology and innovation,"" said Patrick Decker, Xylem president and CEO. ""These challenges are intensifying every day and our powerful portfolio is now even more strongly positioned to deliver solutions at scale.""""We are already seeing the momentum created by integrating two strong companies. On the strength of the market’s continuing underlying demand and our team’s disciplined execution, we are further raising our full-year guidance on revenues, margins and earnings per share.""Story continuesNet income was $92 million, or $0.45 per share. Net income margin decreased 290 basis points to 5.3 percent. These results are driven by higher acquisition and integration costs related to the Evoqua transaction, higher purchase accounting intangible amortization, and higher restructuring and realignment costs, more than offsetting strong operational performance. Coinciding with the Evoqua acquisition, Xylem has updated its adjusted operating income and earnings per share to add back non-cash purchase accounting intangible amortization and recast the 2022 amounts to reflect the change on a comparative basis. Adjusted net income was $202 million, or $0.98 per share, which excludes the impacts of special items of purchase accounting intangible amortization, restructuring, realignment, and special charges.Second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin was 19.1 percent, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 250 basis points. Excluding Evoqua results, adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.6 percent, up 200 basis points over the prior year period. Strong price realization more than offset inflation and, coupled with productivity savings and higher volume, drove the margin expansion, exceeding the impact of strategic investments.Following the close of the Evoqua acquisition, Xylem is now reporting in four segments: Measurement &amp; Control Solutions; Water Infrastructure, now including legacy-Evoqua’s Applied Product Technologies segment; Applied Water; and Integrated Solutions &amp; Services as a new stand-alone segment (with the same perimeter as the legacy-Evoqua segment of the same name) to provide continued transparency on the segment’s performance.OutlookXylem is updating its full-year 2023 guidance to reflect strong organic performance, the combination with Evoqua and the adjustment of purchase accounting intangible amortization.Xylem now expects full-year 2023 revenue of approximately $7.2 billion, up approximately 30 percent on a reported basis and up 9 to 10 percent on an organic basis. This represents an increase from the Company’s previous full-year guidance of 8 to 9 percent on an organic and reported basis.Full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 18 percent, lifted from the previous range of 17.5 to 18.0 percent. This results in adjusted earnings per share of $3.50 to $3.70, raised from the previous range of $3.15 to $3.35. This increase of $0.35 at the mid-point includes an organic increase of $0.15 driven by continuing strong demand, and commercial and operational momentum.Further 2023 planning assumptions are included in Xylem’s second-quarter 2023 earnings materials posted at www.xylem.com/investors. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort.Second Quarter Segment ResultsMeasurement &amp; Control SolutionsXylem’s Measurement &amp; Control Solutions segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in smart metering, network technologies, advanced infrastructure analytics, and analytic instrumentation.Second-quarter 2023 revenue was $415 million, up 20 percent on a reported basis and 21 percent organically, versus the prior year period. Growth was robust across the portfolio and led primarily by strong demand and backlog execution in smart metering.Second-quarter reported operating income for the segment was $26 million, compared to a $5 million loss in the same period last year. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs and $17 million of purchase accounting intangible amortization, was $46 million, a 188 percent increase versus the prior year period, recast to add back $17 million of non-cash purchase accounting amortization. The segment reported operating margin was 6.3 percent, up 770 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin of 11.1 percent increased 650 basis points over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.7 percent, up 590 basis points from the prior year period. Higher volume, strong price realization, and productivity savings exceeded the impact of inflation and unfavorable mix.Water InfrastructureXylem’s Water Infrastructure segment, now including legacy-Evoqua’s Applied Product Technologies segment, consists of its portfolio of businesses serving clean water delivery, wastewater transport and treatment, and dewatering.Second-quarter 2023 revenue was $704 million, a 20 percent increase on a reported basis and 13 percent organically, compared with second-quarter 2022. This strong growth was driven by price realization and robust utilities and industrial demand, particularly in the U.S. and Western Europe.Second-quarter reported operating income for the segment was $106 million, a 2 percent decrease versus the same period last year. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $12 million of special charges, $3 million of restructuring and realignment costs, and $8 million of purchase accounting intangible amortization, was $129 million. This represents a 15 percent increase versus the prior year period, which was recast to add back $1 million of non-cash purchase accounting amortization. Reported operating margin for the segment was 15.1 percent, down 320 basis points versus the prior year period, and adjusted operating margin was 18.3 percent, down 70 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4 percent, flat from the prior year. Excluding Evoqua, adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.6 percent, up 20 basis points on the prior year. Favorable price realization and volume improvements were offset by investments, foreign exchange effects, and unfavorable mix.Applied WaterXylem’s Applied Water segment consists of its portfolio of businesses in industrial, commercial building, and residential applications.Second-quarter 2023 revenue was $478 million, an 11 percent increase on a reported basis and 12 percent organically, year-over-year. Growth was driven by strong price realization and demand across both industrial and building solutions end-markets, particularly in the U.S. and Emerging Markets.Second-quarter reported operating income for the segment was $84 million, a 38 percent increase versus the same period last year. Adjusted operating income, which excludes $2 million of restructuring and realignment costs, was $86 million, a 37 percent increase versus the same period last year. The segment reported operating margin was 17.6 percent, up 340 basis points versus the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin increased 330 basis points over the prior year period to 18.0 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.0 percent, up 290 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion was driven by strong price realization, more than offsetting inflation, coupled with productivity savings.Integrated Solutions &amp; ServicesXylem’s new Integrated Solutions &amp; Services segment, as of May 24, consists of its portfolio of businesses providing water treatment systems and solutions, with an extensive service branch network and fleet of mobile assets.Second-quarter 2023 included revenue of $125 million.Second-quarter reported operating loss for the segment was $7 million. Adjusted operating income was $18 million, which excludes $7 million of special charges, $7 million of restructuring and realignment costs, and $11 million of purchase accounting intangible amortization. The segment reported operating margin was (5.6) percent. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4 percent. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.0 percent reflecting strong margin performance driven by effective price-cost discipline and productivity.Supplemental information on Xylem’s second quarter 2023 earnings and reconciliations for certain non-GAAP items is posted at www.xylem.com/investors.About XylemXylem (XYL) is a leading global water technology company committed to solving the world’s critical water, wastewater, and water-related challenges through technology, innovation, and expertise.

Non-GAAP MeasuresManagement reviews key performance indicators including revenue, gross margins, segment operating income and margins, orders growth, working capital and backlog, among others. In addition, we consider certain non-GAAP (or ""adjusted"") measures to be useful to management and investors evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations, liquidity and management of assets. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives, including but not limited to, dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Excluding revenue, Xylem provides guidance only on a non-GAAP basis due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that would be included in GAAP earnings, such as discrete tax items, without unreasonable effort. These adjusted metrics are consistent with how management views our business and are used to make financial, operating and planning decisions. These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share (basic and diluted) or net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following items to represent the non-GAAP measures we consider to be key performance indicators, as well as the related reconciling items to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.""Organic revenue"" and ""Organic orders"" defined as revenue and orders, respectively, excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency translation and contributions from acquisitions and divestitures. Divestitures include sales or discontinuance of insignificant portions of our business that did not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation.

These tailwinds are likely to have driven occupancy rates and average daily rate (ADR), resulting in higher revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth. Furthermore, new hotel openings, loyalty program, accretive acquisitions and business operating strategies are expected to have aided the company.Reportable segment-wise, owned and leased hotels segment’s growth is likely to reflect solid improvement in business transient and group travel demand. For the second quarter, our model predicts RevPAR for comparable owned and leased hotels to increase 16.4% to $216.8 year over year. Also, we expect occupancy rates and ADR to increase by 1,000 basis points (bps) to 80.4% and 1.9% to $269.7, respectively, compared to the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, for the quarter, we predict adjusted revenues of Americas Management and Franchising, ASPAC Management and Franchising, EAME/SW Asia Management and Franchising and Apple Leisure Group segments to increase 2.2% to $160.5 million, 50.6% to $27.1 million, 22.4% to $25.7 million and 5.8% to $348 million, respectively, year over year. Also, we anticipate the Management, Franchise and Other fee revenues to increase 4.5% to $213.3 million.For the to-be-reported quarter, we expect comparable systemwide hotels’ RevPAR to increase 7.1% to $139.4 year over year. This reflects our expectations for ADR and occupancy rates to increase 2.4% to $203.5 and 300 bps to 68.5%, year over year. Also, we anticipate total managed and franchised properties to increase 9.8% to 1,418 in the quarter, compared to the prior year.Given the market recovery phase, the company expects future booking trends to remain strong, enabling solid top-line growth.Although ongoing inflationary pressures and economic challenges have been major concerns, Hyatt is still likely to witness margin and earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. The strong global market recovery and RevPAR growth are likely to have aided the company in the risky economic environment.For the second quarter, our model predicts adjusted EBITDA and operating margins to increase 340 bps to 20.36% and 430 bps to 14.45, respectively, year over year.Reportable segment-wise, we expect adjusted EBITDA to increase year over year for owned and leased hotels, Americas, ASPAC, EAME/SW Asia and ALG segments to increase 7.4% to $106.3 million, 6.2% to $147.6 million, 233% to $20 million, 63.5% to $21.3 million and 51.1% to $81.6 million, respectively.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Hyatt this time around.

My name is Maria, and I will be your operator. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, all participants of this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jessica John, Vice President of Investor Relations, ESG and Corporate Communications. Ms. John, please proceed.Jessica JohnThank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2023 Earnings and Business Update Call.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Harry Sommer. Harry?Story continuesHarry J. SommerWell, thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us here today. So today marks exactly 1 month since I began my new role as President and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. I'm humbled and honored to have been trusted to lead this incredible company, and I'm excited about the significant opportunities I see at. The responsibility they have to our best network of stakeholders, including our 40,000 team members worldwide, our guests, our travel adviser partners, suppliers, lenders, shipyards, the over 700 communities we visit and all of you in the investment community is not something I take likely.Rest assured, my leadership team, the Board of Directors and I are committed to best positioning Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings for success. My focus now is squarely on the future and how we can refine and enhance our strategy: To optimize our existing fleet of high-quality assets, further differentiate our business model, build resiliency, advance our efforts to drive a positive impact on society in the environment and ultimately drive more value to our shareholders and broader stakeholders.With new leadership not only in my seat, but in all 3 of our award-winning brands and most recently for our vessel operation function, there is a probable feeling of reinvigoration and excitement about the future across the entire company. We are approaching every decision with fresh perspective and new energy, challenging the status quo at every level and encouraging our entire team to think outside of the box and come to the table with new ideas, however big or small. Along with these changes, you can see for yourself on Slide 5 that while many of the senior leaders are new to their roles, there is still continuity and extensive experience among all of the leaders allowing for smooth transition without skipping a beat.Our executive team has an average of over 20 years in the cruise industry and nearly all has been with NCLH for a decade plus. I have the utmost confidence that this team is the right one to take the company to even greater heights. As we are fine-tuning our longer-term strategic vision and priorities, we are also focused on execution today, and Slide 6 outlines my near-term priorities. First, we are focused on capitalizing on the healthy demand environment for cruise, which I will talk about in more detail a little later in my commentary. At a high level, this means remaining within a booked position of approximately 60% to 65% on a 12-month forward basis while increasing pricing and maximizing onboard revenue generation. After years of experience, we believe this level will be the sweet spot based on our current deployment mix, and I am pleased to say we are comfortably in this range today. Our revenue management process is dynamic and we carefully monitor on a granular level how each ship itinerary and voyage is tracking against its optimal booking curve and adjust marketing spend, promotional construct and pricing as needed depending on the market environment to maximize each voyage's contribution to the bottom line.The next priority is rightsizing our cost base through our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives. Mark will dive into more detail on the great progress we've already made on this critical effort but I want to emphasize that we have many additional opportunities in the pipeline to do even more, and we are not shying away from this challenge. The reality is we are operating against the different backdrop today than we were in 2019 requiring an even keener focus on balancing the top line with the cost structure that supports our unique business model and allows us to accelerate our margin recovery and help build resilience to vary external and macroeconomic environments.We are undertaking this effort with a strategic and data-driven approach that allows us to identify additional opportunities for efficiencies, sets, monitor and maintain accountability against concrete KPIs and increased agility to adapt quickly as market or consumer preferences evolve. I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing a change in the core culture of the company at every level of the organization to emphasize efficiency, cost mindfulness and results without impacting the guest experience. We built significant momentum in recent months with this initiative, and we look forward to demonstrating continued improvement in the coming quarters.This [does tells] nicely into our next priority, which is to make strategic and intentional modifications to enhance our offerings and better align them to our guests' needs and wants. There is no question that investment in our product and service offerings are critical to keeping our brand value propositions intact. However, we are refocusing the business on making smart investments in areas that generate the highest return and maximize guest satisfaction over the course of their entire cruise journey starting from the time they book.For example, we are deep in the development of a streamlined booking process at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand which uses generative AI technology to personalize the experience for guests, while also simplifying and reducing the number of considerations required to book by orders of magnitude. This, along with several other initiatives underway, should translate to more satisfied guests who spend more on board and return to sale with us more frequently, resulting in a win-win of higher yields and stronger loyalty.Turning to the fourth priority on the list. The entire team is hard at work preparing for the delivery of Norwegian Viva on Thursday as well as Regent's Seven Seas Grandeur in November, which you can see on Slide 7. I just came back from Italy where I visited the shipyards to check on their progress and I left even more excited than I was previously to welcome these new additions to our already guest and class slate. Both are sister ships to existing vessels that have been elevated even further so we have a high degree of confidence that there will be an overwhelmingly positive reception for these ships from our guests and travel partners, which we are already seeing in their incredible advanced booked position.I'm also pleased that both are on schedule and on time for delivery despite supply chain and other challenges, a testament to our great working relationship we have developed with our partners at Fincantieri. In June, we announced that global music sensation and Latin music icon, Luis Fonsi, will serve as Godfather to Norwegian Viva. The announcement alone generated a reach of over 200 million globally, including new audiences in the targeted Spanish-language demographic.The ship will be christened in Miami later this year and home port in San Juan, Puerto Rico starting in December for a season of Caribbean itineraries. We also recently announced Seven Seas Grandeur's Godmother Sarah Faberge, the great granddaughter of Peter Carl Faberge, the legendary artist jeweler and creative and entrepreneurial genius to find a world renowned company that bears his name. This is a natural choice and celebration of Regent's partnership with Faberge.The disciplined addition of new build is a key component to our strategy, and we have said consistently in the past, we welcome new hardware introductions as they not only generate excitement and bring more attention and awareness to our brand but they are expected to be meaningful drivers of the company's future earnings growth and margin expansion. As the smallest of the 3 large public cruise operators, we continue to believe that we have outsized opportunity to grow our footprint and meaningfully drive the bottom line. Our new build pipeline, which you can see on Slide 8, represents approximately 50% capacity growth by 2028 versus 2019, a CAGR of approximately 5%. After the delivery of 3 new builds in 2023, a record for the company, we have no additional ship delivery scheduled until spring of '25. In the interim, we expect to benefit from both organic growth as well as the annualization of the 2023 new builds next year.And lastly, the final priority on the list, but arguably the most important is starting the path to reduce leverage and derisk the balance sheet. Given the necessary actions we took to navigate the past few challenging years, our leverage ratios are currently not at optimal levels. Our goal remains to evaluate all options available and then clearly define a multiyear pathway to return to an investment-grade like financial position. This won't happen overnight, but as you can see on Slide 9, the company has successfully reduced leverage in the past, and I am confident we will do so again. In the interim term, our expected cash flow generation boosted by our robust new build pipeline, along with normal course debt installment payments are expected to result in significant organic improvement in our net leverage. Over the next several months, we are focused on the successful execution of our near-term priorities while fine-tuning the future vision and strategy for the company with 3 strong brands, a world-class [C] and best team in the industry, we are starting from a strong foundation and a position of strength. And I can say without a doubt that we have a bright future ahead with significant potential to unlock incremental value for our stakeholders.Shifting our discussion now to our current bookings demand and pricing trends. We achieved rental revenue of $2.2 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 33% over the same period in 2019. We have been able to tap into strong consumer demand environment, achieving the right balance of underlying revenue growth with net per diems up 6%, while at the same time materially growing our fleet with capacity of 19% for the quarter. We also kept our ships full, reaching a load factor of 105% in the second quarter, in line with guidance and a long awaited milestone as we return to normalized levels, which you can see on Slide 10.As previously mentioned and as illustrated on Slide 11, several years ago, we strategically shifted our deployment to longer, more immersive itineraries at the Norwegian Cruise Line brand and increased our concentration of premium destinations while reducing our Caribbean deployment. This was designed to attract a higher quality guest and maximize our competitive position. A natural bright product of this new deployment mix is left third and fourth passengers in the cabin, which is what historically pushed passenger occupancy above the 100% mark. As a result, we expect full year occupancy going forward to be roughly 200 basis points lower than 2019 levels. This shift also resulted in an elongation of our booking window which was 255 days in the second quarter, an increase of 51 days or 20% compared to the same quarter in 2019 and meaningfully enhancing our future visibility and reducing our exposure to volatile and less predictable close-in bookings.Thinking together, we believe this strategy will drive higher yields, higher guest satisfaction and higher guest repeat rates with longer runway to optimize our pricing and marketing strategy as macro environment evolved over time.Turning to Slide 12. Our cumulative book position for the second half of 2023 remains ahead of 2019's record performance and at higher prices another indication of continued healthy demand environment and the resilience of our target consumer. This strength continues past this year to sailings in 2024 and beyond, which at this point in the booking curve is our primary focus. In fact, over the past 90 days, over 70% of our ticket sales were for 2024 and '25 sailings, considerably higher than in 2019. Onboard revenue generation, our best real-time indicator of how consumers are feeling financially today also continues to perform exceptionally well. During the quarter, gross onboard revenue for passive Cruise Day was approximately 30% higher than the comparable 2019 period. Our efforts to enhance our market-leading bundled offerings and increase quality touch points with our guests starting from the time of booking and continuing throughout their cruise journey are clearly bearing fruit.In fact, presold revenue on a per passenger day basis for the second quarter of 2023 was over 75% higher than in 2019. An important contributor to our onboard revenue strength as these guests tend to spend more overall throughout their journey than guests who do not pre-book onboard activities. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide an update on our global sustainability program, Sail &amp; Sustain, in which Slide 14 outlines key accomplishments and milestones.Since we last spoke, we published our annual Sail &amp; Sustain report and [SAD Valine] disclosure on World Environmental Day in June. The report provides transparency in our progress and initiatives on top ESG priorities. Some of the highlights this year for more detail on our new climate action strategy and enhanced data and disclosures on community impact, human capital and greenhouse gas emission reported. In addition, we demonstrated progress against several of our environmental goals, including targets to equip our ships with short power capabilities and reduced bunkering of freshwater. I encourage all of you to take some time to explore the report and welcome -- I'm sorry, to explore the report and visit our website for more information.I'm also proud to share that just last week, we announced the winners of our annual Giving Joy recognition program that has been celebrating teachers across North America since 2019 for their hard work and relentless dedication. Each of the 20 winning educators want a free 7-day voyage for 2 and the top 3 grand prize winners were invited to attend the exclusive christening voyage for Norwegian Viva. This year's content drew support from over 3,400 teachers across the U.S. and Canada and garnered hundreds of thousands of votes. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mark for his commentary on our financial position and outlook. Mark?Mark A. KempaThank you, Harry, and good morning, everyone. My commentary today will focus on our second quarter 2023 financial results, 2023 guidance and our financial position. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary on net per diem, net yield and adjusted net cruise cost, excluding fuel per capacity day metrics are on a constant currency basis and comparisons are to the same period in 2019.Slide 15 highlights our second quarter results in which we are very pleased to report that we've met or exceeded guidance for all key metrics. Focusing on the top line, results were strong with revenue per up 33% and net per diems increasing approximately 6.5%, surpassing the high end of guidance, while net yield was in line with guidance at 2.9%. Keep in mind that comparisons to 2019 includes certain premium-priced Baltic and Cuba voyages in that year, which did not operate in 2023.Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel per capacity day, came in below $156 in the quarter, demonstrating further improvement from the prior quarter and the high watermarks seen in the second half of 2022. The reduction in cost this quarter was primarily driven by lower food costs and crew optimization efforts as we continue to realize the benefits of cost savings initiatives identified and implemented during the first phase of this initiative. I will note that across all 3 brands, our guest satisfaction scores remain strong, reflecting our continued focus on cost rationalization without impacting the guest experience.Adjusted EBITDA was approximately $30 million higher than our guidance at approximately $515 million in the quarter. In addition, adjusted EPS of $0.30 also beat our projection by $0.05, and was the first time we generated positive EPS since 2019 as well as the first time that our quarterly adjusted EBITDA exceeded the same quarter in 2019. Shifting our attention to guidance. Our outlook for the third quarter can be found on Slide 16. We are projecting net per diem growth of approximately 7% to 8% and net yield growth of approximately 2.25% to 3.25%.Similar to the second quarter, the loss of certain premium priced Baltic itineraries will continue to impact the comparison versus 2019. In the fourth quarter, pricing and yield are both expected to exhibit mid-teens growth compared to 2019. There are several other factors contributing to the exceptionally strong growth we are expecting for the fourth quarter which include more luxury and upper premium capacity operating with the new Regent and Oceania ships as well as a favorable comp from the rapid exit from Cuba in 2019 and the close in resale of those sailings.Adjusting for these factors, net per diem growth is still expected to be up approximately 10%, which reflects our organic pricing power and strong consumer demand that Harry referred to as well as the benefit of our shift to premium deployments with extended Alaska and Europe seasons this year.Given that we have already -- we already have a substantial booked position and our pace of bookings is on track with our optimal booking curves. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this top line outlook for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net cruise cost excluding fuel per capacity day is expected to be approximately $152 in the third quarter which includes approximately $3 of certain nonrecurring benefits realized in the quarter.Looking ahead, there are also onetime expenses associated with new capacity additions in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for these items, this metric is expected to slightly decrease quarter-over-quarter, which is noted on Slide 17. Taking all of this into account, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter is expected to be approximately $730 million, and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $0.70 on a projected diluted share count of approximately 510 million shares. Keep in mind that we have our 4 outstanding exchangeable notes, which will cause variability in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate EPS when we follow the if-converted method. It is also important to note that despite our ability to settle our 2 2027 exchangeable notes in cash rather than its shares, these notes would still be included in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for GAAP reporting purposes, if they are dilutive in the quarter. We've included an additional slide in our earnings deck, Page -- Slide 24, with more information to help with modeling.Now shifting our focus to our outlook for the full year 2023, we are raising the floor of our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion despite approximately $30 million of headwinds for our interest and fuel expense in the back half of the year. This is expected to translate to adjusted EPS of approximately $0.80 or $0.05 above our prior guidance, reflecting the second quarter outperformance. As you can see on Slide 18, since we first guided for the year in February, we have increased our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 or 14% on strong results in the underlying business which overcame headwinds from higher fuel, FX and interest rates. Excluding these headwinds, adjusted EPS growth versus initial guidance would have been approximately 20 percentage points higher.Taking a closer look at the components of the full year outlook, our healthy net per diem growth of approximately 9% to 10.5% as compared to 2019 and net yield growth guidance of approximately 5% to 6.5% are unchanged versus our prior guidance with capacity up 18%.Turning to costs. Adjusted net cruise costs, excluding fuel first capacity date is expected to average approximately $156 for the full year better than the prior guidance of $159, reflecting lower-than-expected costs in the second quarter. As we have previously mentioned, when comparing this metric to 2019, please note that we do not have the benefit from the disposal of older, less efficient tonnage that some of our peers have. And we have also added capacity at our high-end Oceania and Regent brands, which while accretive to margins do have higher operating costs.Another thing to keep in mind is that the timing of expenses such as dry docks can cause variability in these metrics when comparing different periods. For example, in 2023, we have limited dry docks as we took the opportunity during the pandemic to optimize the schedule while ships were already out of service. As Harry noted earlier, this improvement is the result of the deliberate actions we have taken to enhance margins and rightsize our cost base. To further supplement our internal efforts, which have been in full force since we kicked off this initiative last fall. We have also more recently engaged a third-party consultant to benchmark best practices across sectors and identify incremental areas of opportunity.Our entire team is working around the clock to find ways to accelerate our margin recovery, and we are leaving no stone unturned in the process. To date, the savings we have identified in the broad-based have been broad-based, touching every aspect of the business with the largest buckets consisting of fuel, food and consumables and marketing, as shown on Slide 19.To give you an example of one of the initiatives we are undertaking, we are optimizing crew movements and reducing ship crew transfers, which we expect to result in multimillion dollars savings. To put this into context, each year, we have approximately 90,000 crew movements including 6,000 or so between ships. This is just one example, but it demonstrates how incremental changes can add up to a larger impact on the bottom line. We recognize that we still have more work to do, and we are committed to doing so in a way that preserves the exceptional guest experience and superior service levels that our target higher-end guests expect from our brands all while setting us up well for continued margin improvement in the next few years.Turning our attention to the balance sheet and our debt maturity profile on Slide 20. In the first half of the year, we generated over $1.5 billion of cash flow from operations, including over $1 billion in the second quarter. This allowed us to repay approximately $1.4 billion of debt including the full paydown of our $875 million revolving credit facility. In addition, we have approximately $475 million of scheduled debt payments for the back half of the year, the vast majority of which are related to our export credit agency-backed ship financing.As we have previously stated, we intend to refinance our operating credit facility in the normal course of business before year-end. As mentioned earlier, we expect our net leverage to improve significantly, driven by our organic cash flow generation and payment of scheduled debt installments. Excluding debt associated with ships on order for future delivery, trailing 12 months net leverage is expected to meaningfully reduce versus current elevated levels dropping below 6x over the course of the first half of 2024. This does not adjust for ships that were delivered in 2023 which would have the full debt load in the numerator without a full year of contribution included in adjusted EBITDA.Turning to liquidity. Our overall liquidity position remains strong at approximately $2.4 billion at quarter end, as outlined on Slide 21. This consists of approximately $900 million of cash and cash equivalents, $875 million under our revolver and a $650 million undrawn commitment. This does not include the separate $300 million undrawn backstop commitment, which enhances our future liquidity, but is not currently available to draw. During the quarter, we received approximately $500 million of cash collateral back from a credit card processor. This collateral release not only provided a meaningful increase to liquidity but was also a very strong signal that our external partners have increased confidence in our financial position and future outlook.Overall, I feel the same optimism about the direction of our business. I want to echo Harry's comments that our entire management team is reinvigorated and focused on delivering on our business and strategic goals while also pursuing all opportunities to maximize value creation and create a more nimble and resilient organization for the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Harry for closing comments.Harry J. SommerWell, thank you, Mark. So before turning it over to Q&amp;A, I'd love to leave you with some key takeaways, which you can also see on Slide 22. First, we are focused on execution of the near-term priorities outlined today, including the delivery of 2 new builds in the coming months, while simultaneously fine-tuning our vision of the future. With new leadership in many functions, including my own, we are approaching this exercise of open minds and a fresh perspective as we work to best position the company for success.Second, our target higher-end demographic continues to be healthy and resilient with strong demand for travel and experiences. This is demonstrated by our strong revenue performance, a record up 33% in the quarter with our strong book position, which when looking over the next 12 months is within our sweet spot range of approximately 60% to 65% booked and at higher prices and advanced customer deposits of $3.5 billion, 52% over Q2 2019. Third, we are demonstrating the results of our margin enhancement initiatives, including through our efforts to maximize revenue, improve efficiencies and right size costs. We now have 2 straight quarters of sequential improvement in our key cost metrics and we'll continue to identify and implement additional measures to accelerate our margin recovery while still delivering the exceptional product and service offerings that our guests desire.Lastly, our liquidity position is solid and we are committed to prioritizing restoration of our balance sheet and reducing leverage in the coming years. We've covered a lot today. So I'll conclude our commentary here and open up the call for your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)Jessica JohnBefore we get to the questions on the line, we first want to address the top questions from our online shareholder Q&amp;A platform, which provides all of our investors another avenue to submit and upvote questions for management. One of the top voted questions we received this quarter was, what do you consider the biggest challenge for growth over the next 18 to 24 months? And how do you plan to attack that challenge? Harry, do you want to take that one?Harry J. SommerSure, Jessica. I'm happy to, and that's really a great question. I wouldn't say there are big challenges for growth. If anything, what we have is a huge opportunity. While we're always keeping a keen eye on growing revenue on our existing fleet while tempering costs, growth in the cruise industry is mainly predicated on capacity. And this year, we had 3 vessels entering the fleet, one for each of our award-winning brands, which is the first for our company. This growth allows us to take more guests to more destinations and offer them more varied experiences while contributing to the top and bottom line right off the bat. In addition, with no scheduled shift deliveries in 2024, we have ample opportunity to divest its capacity at high sizes while preparing for new capacity entering our fleet in 2025.So to me, it's not about challenges of growth. It's optimizing the opportunity we have for our new capacity and doing what we have consistently done in the past, which has translated that to outsized impact to our bottom line.Jessica JohnOperator, we can take the first question from the line now.OperatorOur first question from the line comes from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company.Vince Charles CiepielI wanted to talk about kind of the path for organic price growth. I think that was really helpful the way you broke out 4Q, obviously, anticipated to step up a lot. But even comparisons and new hardware, net per diems up 10% points to sequential acceleration through the course of this year. So curious kind of how you're thinking about that into next year? I know you get a lift from full year contribution of the 2023 deliveries. But how are you feeling on organic price today versus 90 days ago?Harry J. SommerSure. I'm happy to take that one. Thanks for the question. I think I can sort of break this up into 3 periods, Q4, 2024 and 2025 and beyond. Q4 still has some comparable distinctions between this year and the past but we are super excited that we're going to see an 18% net per diem growth in '23 versus '19, sort of fully hitting our strides there, and we're pretty well booked for Q4. So we have great confidence in that number. You turn to 2024, we get to a more normalized environment, but we still had some tailwinds on when we compare '24 to '23 because in Q1 of 2023, we were 100% back up in service. So I think we can expect some outsized growth in '24 relative to '23.On a more long-term basis, return back to norm. We've consistently talked about having low to mid-single-digit yield increases year-over-year with moderate and disciplined capacity growth, strong cost control while maintaining high guest satisfaction all leading to the type of oversight dividend earnings growth you saw during our run from '14 to '19. So I think once we get back to '25, that's exactly the path we'll be on again.Vince Charles CiepielGreat. And then maybe on the cost side, obviously, a lot of effort that is visible based on the guide that looks like net cruise revenue is going to be up $2.5 billion plus this year whereas costs certainly up about $100 million. So it's clear that you guys have been focused. Curious, you mentioned guest satisfaction score remaining strong, kind of along this flex down path. But curious maybe what you're seeing within rebooking behavior as more of that 2024 business is coming on the books? How you're feeling about the guests coming back to you?Harry J. SommerSo it's a great question. I think there were 2 parts, so I'll try to address both of them. On the cost side, we are really excited about the efforts that we make and you continue to see the sequential modest improvements in costs, Q1 to Q2 to Q3 and Q4 despite the fact that inflation is still out there for the fact that we continue to reduce our cost structure each quarter, it's not just a reduction in the base but also fighting against inflation. So we're really excited when you can see that number come down.But Mark also alluded to, we're just maybe in the fourth inning of this cost reduction strategy, if I was to use a baseball analogy. And we still believe there are more efforts ahead. We have not baked in anything that we haven't found yet. Our guidance numbers only include what we've identified and what we firmly are able to implement, but we hope to be able to deliver a little bit more in the future.In terms of the guest rebooking behavior, we're simply put, we're at record levels. Across all 3 of our brands, we are seeing -- the one measure that's most relevant internally is we take a look at first-time guests and how -- and when and how much or what percentage of them, I should say, rebooked within the first year or 2 coming back, and the guests coming off the ships in '23 are relooking at record levels compared to '18, '19 and the further back period. So, so far, the formula seems to be working quite well.Mark A. KempaAnd Vince, just to highlight that. I think last quarter, we had mentioned record sales of our CruiseNext certificates. And again, not just another anecdotal point that consumers on board our ships are enjoying their vacation. They're satisfied with the product. Everything we're doing on the cost reduction front is under the lens of protecting the guest experience and the product. So we monitor that closely. And so far, we are seeing positive reception to everything we're doing.OperatorOur next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.Robin Margaret FarleyGreat. Two questions. One is on the yield side, that 14% growth in Q4. I know you have some shift in your premium luxury brands contributing to that. Can you kind of give us a sense of what the increase would be for saving Norwegian brand? Or just to think about the increase that's embedded in that guidance that outside of those new ship additions.And then my other question is on expense. And I'm sorry if I missed if you said what was the nonrecurring benefit in Q3 there? And then just thinking about Q4. It looks like your footnote is sort of saying you're excluding the cost of new ships in that. And I just wanted to clarify, I feel like you hadn't done that before. I just want to think about comparability to expenses in 2019. So is that new that, that guide excludes the cost of new ships?Mark A. KempaThanks for the question. So in Q4, when we talk about our pricing or yield, pricing is expected to be up approximately 18%. And as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, if you adjust for the new capacity as well as the favorable year-over-year comps, that 18% would translate to about 10% of your organic fleet. So very, very strong growth consistent with what we've seen over the last 2 to 3 quarters. So we're very, very pleased with that.In terms of Q3, the onetime nonrecurring benefit, we highlighted that because we didn't want to take artificial credit so to speak, for our cost-reduction initiatives. And that was simply a benefit that we received as a result of some port volume commitments accruals that we had during the course of COVID. We were able to negotiate with the various ports around the world to reduce that. So we didn't want to take credit for that because it's a onetime nonrecurring, so we called that out. And then in Q4, again, trying to be ultra-transparent on the surface, it would appear that our net cruise cost ticks up slightly by $1. But if you really look at that and you exclude the onetime start-up operating costs for both Viva and Grandeur, which come on in the fourth quarter, and you really rightsize that to a normal run rate that is actually reduced by $1 or $2.So again, what we're trying to do is show that we have sequential improvement in our core fundamental operating costs, and you're seeing that over the course of all 4 quarters in the year.OperatorOur next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.Charles Patrick ScholesFirst question concerns the onboard and other line item. How much as we think about for next year and perhaps 2025, you've certainly seen outside growth in this line item. How much do you think of that is really sustainable and how much might be from revenge travel and maybe some of the head growth also might be from bundling or accounting changes. So how should we think about sustainability of that going forward?Harry J. SommerPatrick, it's a good question. I believe it's fully sustainable. We don't necessarily see this huge revenge travel being a huge club nor the levels that we are going at today, diminishing. My best proxy is the Norwegian Cruise Line brand because it's our largest brand and when we look at bookings for this year, every month, it's been a record month in terms of new booking volume. January was the best January in the history of a company, February was the best February, cleared through July, which just ended yesterday, which was the best July in the history of the company. And in fact, our second best booking month of the year, which is a little bit odd because usually July and August is a little bit slower due to certification, people (inaudible) and the like.Onboard pet similarly, every month continues to be good. We're not seeing any weakness. We're not seeing any denigration of trends. There's nothing super unusual that we're doing in bundling today compared to '19. We continue to refine our processes and make the marketing and product proposition a little bit better each quarter than the quarter before. But I don't anticipate any huge changes for '24 either. I think the numbers you see today are the numbers that we would expect to improve ongoing into '24.Mark A. KempaAnd Patrick to further highlight on that is we've talked about we have more touch points with the consumer well prior to the consumer ever stepping on board ship, onboard the vessel. So we're getting more share of the wallet from the consumer ahead of that. And I think one of our stats that we talked about, our prebooked revenue was up by almost 70% versus 2019. So again, it's a longer elongated sales cycle that just helps build that overall onboard revenue product. So we are not seeing any signs of any consumer deterioration. In fact, we continue to see strength on that and we're very happy with that. We continue to see -- expect that to be strong.Charles Patrick ScholesOkay. Just a quick follow-up question, Mark, you had noted in the earnings release about $500 million released from the credit card reserves. Is there any money left still to go with that? Or was that $500 million the last slug of that?Mark A. KempaYes. So we're very happy with that. So with that, that essentially we have 0 collateral with any of our reserve holders as of the quarter end. So that was not only a significant boost to our liquidity profile long term. But more importantly, as I said in my prepared remarks is that it demonstrates confidence in the business from a completely external partner who has no stake in the game other than their inherent risk on advanced ticket sales. So again, we see that as a big demonstration of confidence in the business and where the trajectory of the business is going.OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Wieczynski with Stifel.Steven Moyer WieczynskiSo if we think about your load factors moving forward, which Mark, you mentioned will be about 200 basis points lower than where 2019 levels were that's you guys are long itineraries and whatnot. Just wondering how these lower load factors impact or potentially impact your cost structure moving forward. And add on to that, Mark, as we think about you guys exiting the year in that low, let's call it, 150 range in terms of cost per [APCD], is there any way to help us kind of think about it as well, where you might be able to get that number to over time?Mark A. KempaSteve, it's a good question. I don't look at this as a huge material change in our cost structure. It will be a modest tailwinds having 2% less guests on the ship and the 2% less guests that we have are primarily young children, which aren't particularly expensive. This really isn't about our cost structure. This is really about yield and EBITDA where we believe being in more premium itineraries that are booked further in advance, giving us a much longer booking curve and a more stable and predictable demand profile, which allows us to manage demand, manage our marketing a little bit more effectively and not rely so much on close-in, unstable and unpredictable demand is really a key to our success.I think both Mark and I commented on the higher rebooking rates, the higher advance ticket sales, the higher revenue, the higher booking window, all of these positives which seem to endorse our strategy, which I think we'll see the full benefit of in 2024 as we then will have gone through a full year cost structure.So I mean, listen, bottom line is we're committed to getting back to the EBITDA margins that we saw back in '19 over time. It's going to take us a little time to get there, but we're looking at the trends, and we see a path towards that and we think this premium deployment, which we already started shifting to in '18, '19 will be a vehicle that will allow us to continue on that path.And I'll remind you, we have always had industry-leading yields and we continue to have industry-leading yields far above the competitive set, and we believe that this deployment strategy will allow us to continue with that.Steven Moyer WieczynskiOkay. Got you. And Mark, I just want to kind of add the question I was going to ask before to you. Again, as you kind of think about you guys being in that low 150 range in terms of cost. Is there any way to kind of help us think about where you could get that number over time? I'm not looking for guidance or anything, but just trying to understand where that number potentially could go?Mark A. KempaYes. Look, Steve, obviously, as we're looking to 2024, we're still early in the -- we're in the planning process. And as I said, I think we're probably halfway through the baseball game, so to speak, in terms of initiatives. So we fully anticipate that we're going to improve on that. One note, as I did say in my prepared remarks is we have to keep in mind that there is going to be some dry dock pressure in 2024 when you compare that to '23. But excluding that, I would venture to say that we're going to continue to see improvement in our core fundamental cost structure. So we're working hard. Hopefully, we've demonstrated and given you confidence that quarter-over-quarter, we sequentially continue to improve. We think there's more -- we think there's more to go after, and we're going after it. We're going to do it in a methodical manner, but protecting that guest experience. So stay tuned for the next few quarters to come, and I think we'll continue to show improvement.OperatorOur next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays.Brandt Antoine MontourSo I'm just curious if you could comment on the last 3 months of just fundamental demand strength on the booking side. We've heard from peers that demand has accelerated over those last 3 months. Harry, you just called out in May, June, July being each successively record booking months. But yield guidance for the year was left unchanged. And so I guess the question is, is that a function of guidance 3 months ago just already sort of betting on that acceleration coming? Or did slight price -- flight prices in Europe take a bite out of 3Q? I think we talked about that last quarter or anything else that you might want to highlight?Harry J. SommerThanks, Brandt. Great question. I think with our deployment strategy, most of the demand that we're seeing today and over the last quarter, is primarily focused on 2024. I think we mentioned in our commentary, but if we did, and I'll mention it now, that over the last 13 weeks, over 70% of our new booked revenue was for '24 and '25 departures. So in that respect, this acceleration in demand, the record booking levels that I discussed really are increasing our optimism about 2024. Obviously, in prior guidance, we did assume some bookings, right, for the back half of the year, and they're coming to fruition just as we expected, but these records are really helping to firm up the '24 book position. I mean this record booking window of 255 days, which is 51 days ahead of where we are in '19 is a huge number for the company and again, really gives us confidence for 2024 and beyond.Mark A. KempaSo Brandt, I would not take it as any sort of sign of deceleration in demand. It's just simply a function of our itineraries, we're more fully booked than we ever have been, and there's just not a lot left to sell, so which is a good thing. That gives us more stability and predictability over our numbers. So if anything, that said, there's always -- as we talked about, the consumer is strong onboard revenue trends continue to do well. So I think if there's going to be any room for upside, it's going to be on continued strength of the consumer spend on board.Brandt Antoine MontourThat's really helpful. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on that. I remember pre-COVID, Mark, specifically, you guys could get really great returns on incremental marketing dollars, and that was part of the strategy back then. And so -- now in a world where you guys are, I think, trying to be a little bit, I guess, smarter, you call it, on your marketing dollar spend and Harry, what you think about this. Just as you tinker with that, sort of algorithm or equation with marketing spend. What are you learning about that process? Are you happy with sort of the pricing retention that you're getting as you sort of tinker with the marketing dollars? Or any commentary on that would be helpful.Harry J. SommerI think, Brandt, this is really the first quarter or the second quarter where marketing spend was sort of normal, where we were able to judge each of the individual projects that we do in marketing and see normal ROI, normal returns, normal guest demand. But of course, we weren't just waiting through the last couple of quarters to refine our marketing machine. We've gone all in with marketing analytics. We've done some work with AI, machine learning, all those terms to really refine our individual marketing efforts and what we spend in each individual channel.The best example I can give you on the NCL brand, our spend today on a booking basis, it's similar to what we were doing in '19, but we're generating nearly double the lease right, which is sort of a customer that raises their hand. We think that's fantastic. Conversion rates continue well, which is one of the things that's leading to these record bookings. And as long as we continue refining our analytics around marketing, we're happy with the spend levels.OperatorOur next question comes from James Hardiman with Citi.James Lloyd HardimanSo on the net per diem side, good performance in the second quarter, maybe a little surprised that, that didn't flow through to the full year guidance. And I can certainly appreciate more often than not, if it's onboard spend that's driving that for diem, it's hard to sort of assume -- you have less visibility as we think about the back half of the year. Is that ultimately what happened in Q2 or how should we think about sort of the lack of flow through to the full year?Mark A. KempaWell, James, I think our pricing continues to be very strong. And I think out of the gate, we set very high levels. So again, I wouldn't read into anything whether or not that's -- if there's any deceleration, there is flow through. And the fact that we're still guiding, reiterating 9% to 10.5% growth. So very strong -- we don't have a lot of inventory left to sell, which is by design. So I think it's really going to be on the back of what does the onboard spend level do. And as we've touched on here and several times before, it continues to be very strong. But while we have good visibility on that, there is always some variability on that. So it remains to be seen. And -- but everything we're seeing is we're seeing strength and demand across all sectors of the industry.James Lloyd HardimanGot it. That's helpful. And then a separate question. I mean, we started to see refinancing activity pick up, maybe a more favorable corporate debt environment. What are you seeing there? Is there an opportunity for you guys to do some transaction whether it be a focus on lowering interest rates, extending maturities. I guess if so, what instruments are sort of low-hanging fruit for you guys? I guess, more broadly, I mean, as you think about deleveraging, it seems like the messaging has been more about increasing EBITDA than actually reducing debt. This current environment maybe changed any of that calculation?Mark A. KempaWell, we're -- James, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize our debt structure. And I think we were very fortunate in 2022 to get rid of some of our higher cost debt that was incurred during the pandemic. So we don't have any double-digit notes that are out there. As I did say, we will be out in the market later this year in normal course to refinance or amend and extend our operating facilities, which is our term loan A and our revolver. Beyond that, our next big slug of debt as it comes due in December of 2024. We have [3 5/8] notes that are out there. And we'll look over the course of the next 12 months, what to do with that. But as the cash machine continues to ramp up, as advanced ticket sales continue to ramp up, as EBITDA and margin continues to improve, that is the number one thing we're focused on is delevering to -- in order to help derisk the stock.So we're going to -- we're focused on that. We've done this before. It's going to take a little bit of time. But I think there's more to see over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.Harry J. SommerAnd James, I'll just take this opportunity to reiterate a comment that Mark made in his prepared remarks that we have paid down $1.4 billion of debt in the first half of the year which we're super excited about.James Lloyd HardimanGot it. That's really helpful. And Harry, congratulations on the new role and good luck.OperatorOur next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.Conor T. CunninghamJust one for me. Harry, in the prepared remarks, you made a comment around just culture change that's underway at the company. Can you just provide a little context to that comment? Is it -- why do you need it now? And what's the most -- what's the biggest pressing that you want to achieve with it? Or is that more of a comment just around just the refreshing?Harry J. SommerWell, I think Conor, it's a little bit of both, right? With new leadership team, we have to set a culture that's going to work for us in the mid- to long term. And I'm really excited that the entire leadership group, both the new members and the existing ones are embracing. But if I was to sum it up in one sentence, we're looking to build a culture where we're firmly focused on margin enhancements that we discussed while at the same time delivering exceptional guest experience.And it's really a fine line to walk. I mean you can cut costs and have a worse guest experience. That's not what we're looking to do. Maybe in the past, we were a little bit overly focused on the guest experience without the cost side of it. The question is, how do we balance both of it. And I have to say, I'm excited. Mark and I have both talked about the reduction, the sequential improvement in our underlying core plus over all 4 quarters of this year, while at the same time our guest satisfaction continues to do very well. Our first guest repeat rate is at record levels, really good guest satisfaction scores, advanced bookings through the roof. So this formula seems to be working well. To do this right, it has to take more than one quarter because we're not looking to do anything drastic. We're looking to do this a little bit at a time and make sure that we monitor it closely, and that's what we're going to continue to do.Thank you, Conor. So with that, Maria, we have time for one last question. So please call it out.OperatorOur next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo.Daniel Brian PolitzerJust a quick question, Harry. It feels like there's been a tangible shift more to focus on the cost side than the yield side. Maybe that's just reflected in current numbers versus how you're looking at things. But I guess as you think about 2024, 2025 and as you think about also long-term targets, is this an accurate depiction? And could we maybe get long-term targets from you as you kind of settle into the role later this year or possibly early 2024?Harry J. SommerSo Dan, great question. So first off, we are absolutely focused on yield and cost, right? Because ultimately, margin is a combination of those 2 numbers. I think I discussed in one of the earlier questions that we think we can do an outsized job in 2024 in yield growth somewhat because of the tailwinds we saw in Q4 and '23 when we weren't fully back up to operations, but also because of all the healthy consumer demand metrics that we're seeing over the last few months that we believe will continue into the future. And on a long-term basis, we are committed to a low to mid-single-digit yield increases with moderate and disciplined capacity growth as we had in 2014 to 2019. So that absolutely will continue.In terms of long-term target, we think about it a lot, but I've been on the job now for 30 days. So a little bit early for me to go all in. I've been spending a lot of time with our -- on our ships, with our operations folks, with our employees, with our travel agency community, with our customers, spending some time with the investment community as well. And we believe by early '24, we'll be in the position to provide not only guidance for '24, of course, but also long-term metrics on how we view the future EBITDA margin, yield and cost components of the business going forward.Okay. So once again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around to answer any questions you may have. Have a great day. Stay safe and all the best. Bye now.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Norwegian stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as the cruise company continues to regain its footing following the pandemic.To that point, Norwegian's second-quarter earnings of $0.30 a share topped estimates by 11% and soared from an adjusted loss of -$1.14 a share in the prior-year quarter. On the top line, sales of $2.20 billion surpassed expectations by 1% and soared 86% from a year ago.Still, Norwegian stock fell -12% today primarily attributed to the company’s EPS guidance being below many analysts’ estimates for the third quarter. Norwegian expects Q3 EPS at $0.70 which is also below the Zacks Consensus of $0.80 a share. With that being said, today’s selloff may have already served as a healthy correction.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRockwell Automation (ROK): Falling -7% today Rockwell Automation’s stock could be a buy-the-dip candidate after slightly missing its fiscal third-quarter top and bottom line expectations this morning.Providing industrial automation and information services, Rockwell stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Retaining this favorable ranking will largely depend on the trend in earnings estimate revisions following the report as the selloff may present opportunity for longer-term investors.Rockwell’s Q3 earnings missed expectations by -5% at $3.01 per share compared to EPS estimates of $3.19. However, this was still up 13% from Q3 earnings of $2.66 per share a year ago. Quarterly sales were up 14% YoY to $2.23 billion but fell -2% short of expectations.Story continuesDespite the weaker-than-expected results, Rockwell’s quarterly growth was still strong and the company raised the midpoint of its fiscal 2023 earnings and sales growth guidance. Rockwell now expects FY23 sales growth at a range of 14-16% from previous guidance of 12.5-16.5% with the Zacks Consensus calling for about 15% sales growth. Annual EPS guidance from Rockwell is now at a range between $11.70-12.10 compared to previous guidance of $11.50-12.20 with the Zacks Consensus for FY23 earnings at $12.02 a share which would be up 26% from 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUber Technologies (UBER): There were many eyes on Uber’s stock today which dipped -5% after reporting its Q2 results this morning.Uber also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the pullback appears to be some profit-taking mixed with concerns of lower demand among the company’s freight segment. Sales for Uber’s Freight and Transportation services fell -30% YoY to $1.28 billion and the segment posted an operating loss of -$14 million compared to a profit of $5 million a year ago.Uber still crushed earnings expectations with EPS at $0.18 compared to estimates that called for an adjusted loss of -$0.01 a share. This also soared from an adjusted loss of -$1.33 a share in Q2 2022. Sales of $9.23 billion rose 14% YoY but missed estimates by -1%.Analysts still appeared to be optimistic about Uber’s stock despite lowering lofty price targets on Uber freight concerns. To that point, the current Average Zacks Price Target of $53.84 a share still suggests 14% upside from current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFor now, Norwegian Curse Line, Rockwell Automation, and Uber Technologies stock still look attractive at their current levels and today’s selloff may have presented even better buying opportunities. The long-term prospects of these companies is intriguing and they are certainly buy the dip canidates. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

45,e249d331-8467-3cdc-a378-75281bb7e24f,NCLH,2023-08-02,"Caterpillar stock, Norwegian Cruise Line Q3 outlook, Tupperware shares rally: Top stocks",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/caterpillar-stock-norwegian-cruise-line-202728350.html,1690921648,VIDEO,"['CAT', 'TUP', 'NCLH']","[Caterpillar shares climb to a record high after topping second-quarter earnings estimates. Norwegian Cruise Line's stock drops despite posting an earnings beat, citing a disappointing third-quarter profit outlook amid a boom in summer travel demand. Lastly, Tupperware joins the ranks of meme stock trades as its shares rally on retail investor trends.Video Transcript- Let's take a look at some of the big movers of the day. First up, shares of Caterpillar jumping to a record high in today's session after beating estimates on both the top and bottom line. The company also saying that its full year operating margin will come in at the top end of its previous guidance. We saw the excitement, Akiko, in shares on the heels of this news. And we know many investors look at Caterpillar as a bellwether here, not only for the US economy, but really for the global economy. So the fact that demand has remained resilient here, obviously a strong sign for the second half of the year and going forward.- Yeah, Seana. Certainly a broader commentary on this macro environment that we're seeing. I mean, we've been hearing so much about the construction boom. And that is really reflected in the numbers that we got from Caterpillar today. We're talking about not just new homes but industrial construction projects that are taking place. Non-residential construction accounting for a majority of the company's equipment sales. Part of that is what we've seen coming through from DC, whether it's the Infrastructure Bill, CHIPS Act, the IRA. We've heard so much about those investments taking shape.The one thing that I thought was interesting though is that the company talking about the slowdown they're continuing to see in the Chinese market. Remember the CEO back in April said that total share of sales would be about 5% to 10% below normal expected range. And then today, we heard the company say yet again that they expect it to be even slower. So sort of interesting when we're trying to get a better gauge of what that rebound or lack of rebound is looking like over in the Chinese market.Story continuesWell, Norwegian Cruise Line shares sinking today despite beating Wall Street's estimates. But its third quarter guidance that's hitting the stock today missed estimates for what is supposed to be the best three months for cruise operators. And you see that stock down more than 12% in the session. Norwegian now expecting adjusted earnings of $0.70 a share in the third quarter. And Seana, this has got to be disappointing because we've been talking so much about the pent up demand that customers increasingly are willing to spend on this. That guidance just didn't come in where investors wanted it to be.- It wasn't. And Akiko, this almost seems like a reality check here for investors. But the bar though was set very high. We've gotten very strong results from their two largest rivals. So investors had very high expectations going into these results. So any sort of disappointment. I think we were prepared to some degree to see some pressure on the stock. But again, a big drop today with shares closing off just about 12%.When you take a look at the numbers, it wasn't too bad for the quarter revenue did beat the Street's expectations up 86% year over year to just over $2.2 billion. But again, that bar set very high from the rivals here at Norwegian, falling below what the Street was hoping to see. Stifel was out with some reaction commentary today, saying that today's weakness, they view it actually as a buying opportunity though because they believe expectations are way too elevated for this company when compared to Royal Caribbean. So again, they're seeing a little bit of a buying opportunity here. But across the board, there was so much expectation for that very, very strong, resilient consumer, very strong demand. So Norwegian just falling a bit short there.Let's also take a look at Tupperware. This stock has certainly been on a tear in recent days. Shares surging another 25% today. The gains reminiscent of that meme stock mania that swept the markets in recent years. And the reaction that-- the action, I should say, in general, that we've seen in Tupperware really proving the fact that the meme trading frenzy remains alive and well, Akiko.Short interest is the highest level that we've seen in more than a year. And this is a stock that's been trending on some of those retail investor favorite sites like StockTwits, like Reddit, helping to explain why there's so much interest in the name that Tupperware has warned that they could maybe potentially not be around here for much longer. So the investor interest, you got to kind of second guess and question where this is coming from.- Yeah. Among the top traded stocks today in this session, this is a company that back in April said it was near bankruptcy. We're talking about shares at roughly $1 at the beginning of July. And here we are more. The stock price has more than quadrupled. Seana, I think I have stopped trying to explain some of this meme trade. But it is interesting to see what the excitement is. I mean, I don't know.The other name, by the way, that's also trading, among the most traded today. Yellow, which is a trucking company. I mean, there's a number of those stocks that were starting to sort of percolate through this meme frenzy. But I mean, we'll see if it sticks.- If you buy in, you got to be prepared to lose it all, at least with names like that.]"

Product enhancements, changes in the business mix and reinsurance agreements are expected to contribute to the upcoming results. Insurers like Lincoln National Corporation LNC, MetLife, Inc. MET, American Financial Group, Inc. AFG, Radian Group Inc. RDN and MGIC Investment Corporation MTG are set to report their second-quarter earnings on Aug 2. However, an active catastrophe level is likely to have weighed on their performance.Improved pricing, solid retention and exposure growth across business lines are likely to have aided premiums. An active catastrophe environment accelerated the policy renewal rate and led to better pricing in the first quarter. Per a report by MarketScout, the composite rate for the United States commercial property and casualty lines increased more than 5% in the to-be-reported quarter.JP Morgan estimates insured losses from major natural catastrophes, driven by storms in the United States, to be less than $10 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, better pricing, reinsurance arrangements, portfolio repositioning, reinsurance covers, favorable reserve development and prudent underwriting are likely to drive an improvement in underwriting results.With four rate hikes already in 2023, investment income is likely to have improved, as insurers are beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. The Fed had raised its key interest rate by 0.25% and reached a target range of 5.25% to 5.5%, which marked the highest level in 22 years.A bigger investment asset base, higher reinvestment rate and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds and real estate among others are expected to have aided net investment income in the second quarter.Life insurers continue to roll out investment products that provide bundled covers of guaranteed retirement income, life and healthcare to cater to customers preferring policies with “living” benefits more than those with death benefits. A compelling product portfolio is expected to have aided sales of life insurers in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased travel across the world is likely to have induced higher auto premiums. A stronger mortgage market is likely to have favored mortgage insurance premiums. A low unemployment rate is likely to have aided commercial insurance and group insurance in the to-be-reported quarter.Courtesy of their solid capital position, insurers pursued strategic mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to have diversified their portfolios, sharpened their competitive edge and expanded their geographic footprint in the second quarter. They also enhanced shareholders' value via share buybacks and dividend increases.The insurance industry frequently resorts to significant technology investments in blockchain, AI and advanced analytics, which are aimed to improve operational efficiency, enhance cybersecurity and upgrade policy administration. These investments are likely to have curbed costs and aided the margins of insurers in the second quarter.Story continuesInsurance Providers Reporting on Aug 2Against the backdrop discussed above, let’s find out how the following five companies are placed ahead of their June-quarter earnings release tomorrow.Per our proprietary model, the combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — increases the odds of an earnings beat.

NRG brought back the 600-megawatt unit for several days last week in test mode and now expects it to return in late August after originally planning to restart it in late June.NRG said the test showed ""several adjustments which need to be made before we can go back into start-up,"" spokesperson Ann Duhon said.The coal unit had hosted the $1 billion Petra Nova carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) plant, which sent the carbon dioxide gas about 80 miles (130 km) by pipeline where it was pumped into an aging oilfield to boost output, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery. NRG shut Petra Nova on May 1, 2020, citing a plunge in oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic.JX Nippon, a Japanese energy company, is now the sole owner of Petra Nova after buying NRG's share last year. JX Nippon says that the CCS plant will start up once Unit 8 starts. ""Thorough preparations are being made to resume operations as soon as CO2 supply from the power plant becomes available,"" a spokesperson said.Petra Nova has been seen as a major test of efforts to sequester CO2, the major greenhouse gas, and store it permanently underground. CCS is considered by many governments and companies as crucial to curbing climate change.Petra Nova had received a $190 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. It missed targets before shutting in 2020, capturing 3.8 million short tons of CO2 during its first three years, shy of the 4.6 million tons developers had expected.

Experts point to extreme heat and oil production cuts,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gas-prices-rising-experts-090814004.html,1690967294,STORY,['CL=F'],"[NEW YORK (AP) — Drivers are in for another headache at the pump as U.S. gas prices continue to rise.The national average for gas prices stood at about $3.78 a gallon on Tuesday — about 25 cents higher than that seen one month ago, according to motor club AAA. While today's prices at the pump remain far lower than they were last year, when energy costs soared worldwide in the months following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, experts say such a jump is unusual.“Usually it takes a hurricane to move prices that much,” said AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross, who said the rise is especially interesting as “fewer people are are fueling up” their cars this summer compared to years past.A motorist parks near fuel pumps at a service station Thursday, June 22, 2023, in Denver. The national average for gas prices stood at about $3.78 a gallon on Tuesday — about 25 cents higher than that seen one month ago, according to motor club AAA. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)In the U.S., gasoline prices are highly dependent on crude oil. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has stayed above $80 per barrel since Thursday, standing at over $81 as of Tuesday afternoon. That marks a $12 jump since July 3, according to OPIS global head of energy analysis Tom Kloza.There are a few factors causing oil prices to rise, Gross and Kloza say, including global supply production cuts and impacts of this summer's extreme heat on refineries. Here's what you need to know.WHY ARE GAS PRICES RISING? BLAME THE HEAT AND PRODUCTION CUTSThis summer's record temperatures are partly to blame for the rising gas prices.“While the heat may be keeping people home, it’s also keeps refineries from making refined product,” Gross explained, noting that refineries are typically designed to operate between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (0 and 35 degrees Celsius). “They don’t like temperature extremes because they’re inherently dangerous places... So they dial back the production for safety purposes, but that then constrains supply.”According to Kloza, there are about 10 million daily barrels of U.S. refining capacity on the Gulf Coast. The heat wave has caused those refineries to operate below normal capacity — resulting in a loss of hundreds of thousands of barrels each day, he said.Story continuesStill, “the fact that some refineries are struggling has meant that the ones who are able to operate are making really nice profits,"" he said. Today's U.S. domestic demand is about 9 million barrels a day, about a half a million below expectations for peak summer months, but the country is exporting a lot of gasoline, he added.Beyond the heat, Kloza pointed to crude supply cuts from major producing countries in the OPEC+ alliance. In July, for example, Saudi Arabia starting reducing how much oil it sends to the global economy by 1 million barrels each day. Russia is also exporting less, he said.The cuts aren't OPEC-wide, Gross noted. As inflation eases, he suspects that better economic prospects may also be putting pressure on oil worldwide.WHICH STATES HAVE THE HIGHEST GAS PRICES TODAY?As always, certain parts of the U.S. are facing high gas prices than others — due to factors ranging from routine maintenance at regional refineries to limited supplies in some states.On Tuesday, according to the AAA, California had the highest gas prices in the nation at an average of $5.01 a gallon. Washington and Oregon followed at $4.96 and $4.92, respectively.Mississippi had the lowest average at about $3.29 per gallon, followed by $3.39 in Louisiana and and $3.40 in Alabama.WILL GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO CLIMB?It's hard to know what gas prices will look like in the coming weeks, experts say.While relief from the heat can hopefully be expected as we enter the fall, both Gross and Kloza pointed to risk of hurricanes — which, of course, leads refineries to power down.“If you could guarantee we’re not going to have tropical storm force or hurricane winds in the Gulf of Mexico, I’d say it’s going to be clear sailing for the rest of the year. But that’s a real fly in the ointment,” Kloza said, pointing to the unprecedented water temperatures the region has seen recently.HOW CAN I SAVE GAS?If you're looking to save money and cut back on trips to the pump, there are a few ways you can maximize your mileage per gallon.One important habit is staying on top of getting your tire pressure checked, Gross said. In addition to safety risks, low tire pressure is “not maximizing your fuel efficiency,” costing you more money down the road, he said.AAA offers additional gas saving tips — which include using cruise control when possible, not overfilling your tank at the pump and removing unneeded items in your car's trunk to cut down on excess weight.]"

The draw was driven by increased refinery runs and strong crude exportsDespite the record stock draw, U.S. oil prices fell amid falls across financial markets after rating agency Fitch downgraded the U.S. government's top credit rating.U.S. crude futures settled down $1.88, or 2.3%, to $79.49 a barrel while Brent crude futures settled down $1.71, or 2%, to $83.20 a barrel.Both contracts rose by more than $1 earlier on the session, buoyed by falling U.S. stockpiles in Tuesday's data from the American Petroleum Industry, which also indicated a large U.S. stockpile drawdown.That the U.S. government has pulled an offer to buy 6 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve also pushed prices lower, traders and analysts said.Total product supplied - a proxy for demand - also fell by 1.3 million barrels in the week to 20 million barrels per day, the EIA said.""Gasoline demand seems to have peaked after higher prices at the pump,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst of the Americas at OANDA.Crude oil inventories have also begun to drop in other regions as demand outpaces supply, which has been constrained by deep production cuts from Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said.Concerns have risen that oil buying in China, the world's biggest oil importer, may slow as prices rise.Weak PMI data released this week, meanwhile, indicated fuel demand may be weaker than expected.""Chinese crude buying has been opportunistic rather than due to higher demand. (The) market continues to be driven purely by supply constraints, which are always subject to potential political volatility,"" said Sparta Commodities' Philip Jones-Lux.Story continuesAnalysts expect Saudi Arabia to extend its voluntary oil output cut of 1 million barrels per day for another month to include September in a meeting of producers on Friday.OPEC+, which groups OPEC and allies led by Russia, is unlikely to revise its current oil output policy when a panel meets on Friday, six OPEC+ sources told Reuters.(Additional reporting by Trixie Yap in Singapore and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by Jason Neely, Barbara Lewis, Nick Macfie and Giles Elgood)]"

QuoteQuarterly Numbers in DetailForensic and Litigation Consulting revenues increased 10.9% year over year to $182.2 million and beat our estimate of $173.4 million. The uptick was primarily driven by higher demand and realized bill rates for investigations and data &amp; analytics services.Strategic Communications revenues increased 15% year over year to $82.7 million and beat our estimate of $76.4 million. The upside can be attributed to higher demand for corporate reputation and public affairs services.Technology revenues increased 25.3% year over year to $97.4 million and surpassed our estimate of $86.9 million. The improvement was primarily driven by higher demand for investigations and litigation services, partially offset by lower demand for information governance, privacy &amp; security services.Economic Consulting revenues increased 23% year over year to $201.8 million and surpassed our estimate of $184.3 million. The rise can be attributed to higher demand for non-merger and acquisition (“M&amp;A”)-related antitrust, M&amp;A-related antitrust and international arbitration services.

(NYSE: FE) today reported second quarter 2023 GAAP earnings of $235 million, or $0.41 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $3.0 billion.

Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Operating (non-GAAP) earnings* were $0.47 per share in the second quarter of 2023, in the upper end of the company's guidance range, and were $0.53 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Results for both periods exclude special items listed below.Continued growth from regulated investments and lower operating expenses were positive earnings drivers in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. Together, they partially offset higher financing costs and lower pension credits, as well as lower distribution sales that reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily resulting from the impact of mild temperatures.""FirstEnergy is focused on driving sustainable growth through capital investments that enable the energy transition, improve the reliability and resiliency of the electric grid, and support economic activity and innovation in our communities,"" said Brian X. Tierney, president and chief executive officer. ""These capital investments, together with the sound strategies that are already underway to strengthen our financial position and enhance our operations, support our goal of becoming a premier electric utility company, and our mission of delivering safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers and communities,"" he said.Story continuesFirstEnergy reaffirmed its full-year 2023 operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range of $2.44 to $2.64 per share based on 574 million shares outstanding.

Load was down 1.1% on a weather-adjusted basis.In the Regulated Transmission business, second quarter 2023 operating results primarily benefited from the company's ongoing Energizing the Future investment program. Rate base increased 8.2%, or more than $700 million, from the second quarter of 2022.In Corporate/Other, second quarter 2023 operating results were essentially flat compared to the second quarter of 2022. Significant drivers include lower operating expenses and lower interest expense, which were offset primarily by a lower earnings contribution from the company's legacy investment in Signal Peak. First Half ResultsFor the first half of 2023, FirstEnergy reported GAAP earnings of $527 million, or $0.92 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $6.2 billion. This compares to GAAP earnings of $475 million, or $0.83 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $5.8 billion in the first half of 2022.

These factors partially offset the impact of lower pension credits, as well as lower distribution sales that reduced earnings by $0.18 per share compared to the first half of 2022, primarily resulting from the impact of extremely mild weather.Through the first six months, heating degree days were 17% below normal and 16% below last year, while cooling degree days were 40% and 47% below normal and last year, respectively. Consolidated GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) to Operating (Non-GAAP) EPS* ReconciliationThree Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 302023202220232022Earnings Attributable to FirstEnergy Corp.(GAAP) - $M$235$187$527$475Basic EPS (GAAP)$0.41$0.33$0.92$0.83Excluding Special Items*:Debt-related costs0.050.170.050.23Enhanced employee retirement and other related costs0.04—0.04—FE Forward cost to achieve—0.010.060.01Investigation and other related costs0.030.020.040.03Mark-to-market adjustments – Pension/OPEB actuarial assumptions(0.06)—(0.06)—Strategic transaction costs———0.01Regulatory charges——0.010.01Total Special Items*0.060.200.140.29Operating EPS (Non-GAAP)$0.47$0.53$1.06$1.12Per share amounts for the special items above are based on the after-tax effect of each item divided by the number of shares outstanding for the period. The current and deferred income tax effect was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pre-tax amount if deductible/taxable. The income tax rate ranges from 21% to 29%. Basic EPS (GAAP) and Operating EPS (Non-GAAP) is based on 571 million shares for the Second Quarter and First Half 2022, 573 million shares for the Second Quarter and First Half 2023.  Non-GAAP financial measures* Operating earnings (loss) excludes ""special items"" as described below, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of these items in the context of long-term annual operating EPS growth rate projections because these items, which could be significant, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. Consequently, the Company is unable to reconcile operating earnings guidance and long-term annual operating EPS growth projections to a GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. Basic (GAAP) EPS and Operating EPS and Basic (GAAP) EPS and Operating EPS for each segment are calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes special items as discussed above, for the periods presented by 571 million shares for the second quarter, first six months, and full year 2022, 573 million shares for the second quarter, first six months and third quarter of 2023, and 574 million shares for full year 2023. Intercompany interest expense/income between Regulated Transmission and Corporate/Other associated with the proceeds from the FET 19.9% minority interest transaction received on May 31, 2022, has been eliminated for segment reporting purposes which is consistent with the methodology used in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 reporting. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures such as Operating earnings (loss), and Operating EPS to evaluate the Company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision-making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Additionally, management uses Operating EPS by segment to further evaluate the Company's performance by segment and references this non-GAAP financial measure in its decision-making. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss), Operating EPS, and Operating EPS by segment, provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the Company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the Company's peer group. All of these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, FE has provided, where possible without unreasonable effort, quantitative reconciliations within this presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.Investor Materials and TeleconferenceFirstEnergy's Strategic and Financial Highlights presentation is posted on the company's Investor Information website – www.firstenergycorp.com/ir.

This compares to earnings of $0.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 30%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company that makes pumps, valves and other parts for the oil and gas industries would post earnings of $0.26 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.40, delivering a surprise of 53.85%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Flowserve , which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, posted revenues of $1.08 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.12%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $882.22 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Flowserve shares have added about 23.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.5%.What's Next for Flowserve?While Flowserve has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Flowserve: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.42 on $985.37 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.82 on $4.03 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Manufacturing - General Industrial is currently in the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Alta Equipment (ALTG), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 9.This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.6%.

These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from what is forecast in such forward-looking statements, and include, without limitation, the following: the impact of the global outbreak of COVID-19 on our business and operations; global supply chain disruptions and the current inflationary environment could adversely affect the efficiency of our manufacturing and increase the cost of providing our products to customers; a portion of our bookings may not lead to completed sales, and our ability to convert bookings into revenues at acceptable profit margins; changes in global economic conditions and the potential for unexpected cancellations or delays of customer orders in our reported backlog; our dependence on our customers’ ability to make required capital investment and maintenance expenditures; if we are not able to successfully execute and realize the expected financial benefits from any restructuring and realignment initiatives, our business could be adversely affected; the substantial dependence of our sales on the success of the oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management industries; the adverse impact of volatile raw materials prices on our products and operating margins; economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations, including military actions, trade embargoes, epidemics or pandemics or changes to tariffs or trade agreements that could affect customer markets, particularly North African, Latin American, Asian and Middle Eastern markets and global oil and gas producers, and non-compliance with U.S. export/re-export control, foreign corrupt practice laws, economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; increased aging and slower collection of receivables, particularly in Latin America and other emerging markets; our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including in hyperinflationary countries such as Venezuela and Argentina; potential adverse consequences resulting from litigation to which we are a party, such as litigation involving asbestos-containing material claims; expectations regarding acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; the potential adverse impact of an impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets; our dependence upon third-party suppliers whose failure to perform timely could adversely affect our business operations; the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; potential work stoppages and other labor matters; access to public and private sources of debt financing; our inability to protect our intellectual property in the U.S., as well as in foreign countries; obligations under our defined benefit pension plans; our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud; the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results; our information technology infrastructure could be subject to service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, which could disrupt our business operations and result in the loss of critical and confidential information; ineffective internal controls could impact the accuracy and timely reporting of our business and financial results; and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.All forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain non-recurring items present additional useful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods, providing investors with a clearer view of the underlying trends of the business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, planning and compensation decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures, which may be inconsistent with similarly captioned measures presented by other companies, should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(Unaudited)Three Months Ended June 30,(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)20232022Sales$1,080,376$882,222Cost of sales(757,616)(632,393)Gross profit322,760249,829Selling, general and administrative expense(230,082)(194,606)Net earnings from affiliates3,9705,109Operating income96,64860,332Interest expense(16,554)(11,062)Interest income1,907854Other income (expense), net(5,543)7,589Earnings before income taxes76,45857,713Provision for income taxes(21,304)(11,618)Net earnings, including noncontrolling interests55,15446,095Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(3,951)(1,318)Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation$51,203$44,777Net earnings per share attributable to Flowserve Corporation common shareholders:Basic$0.39$0.34Diluted0.390.34Weighted average shares – basic131,171130,666Weighted average shares – diluted131,810131,245Consolidated Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measure (Unaudited)(Amounts in thousands, except per share data)Three Months Ended June 30, 2023Gross ProfitSelling, General &amp;

With oil price being lower remarkably than the year-ago quarter, the overall energy business scenario is likely to have been relatively hurt.The view has been strengthened by the recent earnings release of energy biggie Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM. Lower realizations of crude prices not only led ExxonMobil to miss second-quarter estimates, but its bottom line also declined year over year. In the United States, ExxonMobil recorded crude price realization of $71.36 per barrel, significantly lower than the year-ago quarter’s $107.78 and missed our estimate of $73.20.Q2 Oil PriceThe pricing scenario of oil in second-quarter 2023 was not as healthy as in the prior-year quarter. Per data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the monthly WTI crude spot prices for this year’s April, May and June were $79.45 per barrel, $71.58 per barrel and $70.25 per barrel, respectively. The commodity prices were significantly lower than last year’s prices of $101.78 per barrel, $109.55 per barrel and $114.84 per barrel, respectively. Fear of recession and economic slowdown probably hurt the pricing environment.Natural gas price was also relatively unhealthier. Thus, lower commodity prices are likely to have hurt upstream operations in the June quarter.  However, looking at crude prices in the second quarter of this year, it has been clear that oil price was still highly favorable for exploration and production activities.Midstream BusinessBy its very nature, midstream operations have lower exposure to volatility in oil and gas prices since pipeline networks are utilized by shippers for transporting oil and natural gas for a length of time. Thus, in the June quarter, too, it is expected that midstream operations were likely to have generated stable fee-based revenues.Story continuesHowever, compared with the prior-year quarter, midstream business might have been relatively unhealthy. This is because, since commodity prices were lower in the June quarter, it was probably leading to lower production. This is likely to have hurt demand for pipeline and storage assets.Per the latest Zacks Earnings Trends report, earnings for the Zacks oil/energy sector are expected to be below the year-earlier level by 51.4%. Supporting the overall analysis, the figure also reflects that the energy business as a whole was not as favorable as it was in the prior-year quarter.Key ReleasesGiven the backdrop, let us look at how the following energy companies are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases slated for Aug 2.Our proprietary model indicates that a company needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

And if there’s one big theme to our list this year, it’s this: Even the world’s largest companies can be upended and dethroned.Walmart, which generated $611 billion in sales in 2022, has been sitting pretty as the biggest company on the planet by revenue for 10 years straight. But it needs to watch its back.Thanks to the Ukraine war’s impact on oil and gas prices and Saudi Arabia’s ability to cheaply pump oil from its immense reserves, Saudi Aramco had a banner year. It narrowly missed the top slot with $604 billion in revenue, up 51% from the year prior. Even more impressively, Saudi Aramco earned $159 billion in net income, racking up the most profitable year ever for a Global 500 company. If the energy industry has another surge like that in 2023, Walmart could get knocked off its perch.But here’s the thing: Like the leaders of the world’s other giant crude oil producers, the folks at Saudi Aramco are also looking over their shoulders. They know that a global green transition will eventually end their dominance, unless they get serious about the alternative-fuel business. That’s one reason why the Saudi government, which controls Aramco, is plowing its profits into green-tech R&amp;D and a host of other industries, as Vivienne Walt explains in her story in this issue.A little further down the list, a different earthquake is underway. Alphabet, which ranks No. 17 on this year’s Global 500, is facing a classic innovator’s dilemma thanks to generative A.I. Alphabet’s Google has thrown more money and expertise at A.I. than just about any other tech giant. But now, that same revolutionary technology is threatening the search business that has fueled Google’s profit-making machine since the 2000s.The No. 1 Threatener is Microsoft (No. 30 on the G500), thanks to its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has needled Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai and his engineers, saying, “I want people to know that we made them dance.”Story continuesPichai’s predicament is tricky. Google needs to fight Microsoft and other A.I. rivals with its own, better product—and as Jeremy Kahn reports in this issue, Pichai and his team are doing just that. Whoever builds the best mousetrap in generative A.I., whether it’s Google, or Microsoft, or Meta (No. 81), or some as-yet-unknown startup, could transform how the world searches for information. But Google is earning $160 billion a year from search and advertising based on the status quo. If the way people use the internet is greatly changed by technologies like chatbots or personal assistants, there is no guarantee Alphabet can protect that cash cow—and it has no obvious revenue substitute at that scale.To see the authoritative ranking of the current corporate world order, see our full list here.

A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.Story continuesGale E. KlappaWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.92 a share. After a down first quarter marked by one of the warmest winters on record, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and we're firmly on track for a strong 2023. Today, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. The range is $4.58 to $4.62 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather going forward. As always, we're focused on the fundamentals of our business: Financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. During the second quarter, we also continued to move forward on our major initiatives, including the investments outlined in our $20.1 billion ESG progress plan. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. We expect to quadruple the amount of renewable generation for our regulated customers, add highly efficient gas field capacity to ensure reliability and continue to harden our delivery networks. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in just a moment. As a reminder, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive growth in earnings per share of 6.5% to 7% a year. And as we've discussed, there is no need to issue equity for this $20.1 billion 5-year plan. Now over the past few months, many of you have asked about the trajectory of our next 5-year plan. Our updated plan will cover the period 2024 through 2028. Of course, if growth in demand for capacity and energy drives our next capital plan significantly higher, then we'll evaluate all our financing options. In addition to incremental debt and refinancing opportunities, our options could include accessing the equity market through our dividend reinvestment plans, employee benefit plans and at-the-market programs. I would stress that at this point, we do not see the need for any block equity offering. Again, as a reminder, any equity need would be driven by growth and would support our long-term growth projections. As you would expect, we're on schedule with the development of our next 5-year plan, and as usual, we'll share the details with you in the fall. Now let's take a brief look, we'll switch gears and take a brief look at our regional economy. We're still seeing a very strong labor market in Wisconsin. In June, the state added 7,000 private sector jobs. The unemployment rate came in at 2.5%, well below the national average, and the labor force participation rate rose for the fourth straight month in Wisconsin to 65.3%. Very solid numbers. We're also encouraged by the pipeline of economic activity in our region. Last quarter, you heard that Microsoft plans to make an initial investment of $1 billion to create a new data center campus. This new complex will be built south of Milwaukee, in the Wisconsin Innovation Park where Foxconn is located. Microsoft has purchased 315 acres in Area 3 of the park and is moving full speed ahead. In fact, earthwork at the site began just a few days ago. So along with American Transmission Company, we're working closely, in fact, on a weekly basis with Microsoft to determine the full extent of the energy infrastructure that will be needed to serve this development. We're excited about supporting Microsoft as the company moves forward with a major technology investment, and we'll update you as the planning proceeds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments and on our operations. Scott, all yours.Scott J. LauberThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. In May, we filed a limited reopener to set 2024 rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The filings address the recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into Service this year and in 2024. These are renewable facilities, RICE generation and LNG reliability investments. The projects have already been approved by the Wisconsin Commission. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. We expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. After 9 years without a base rate case at Peoples Gas, we're making these requests for 2024 to support our investments in critical infrastructure. In mid-July, the staff filed its rebuttal testimony, recommending a 9.83% return on equity and an equity layer of 50.83% for Peoples Gas. This was consistent with the initial recommendations from the staff. We expect a final decision by the end of the year. And moving to the other states, we are very pleased that we have reached a settlement agreement in our rate reviews at both Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. The Minnesota Commission is considering a settlement that would provide a 7.1% increase in base rates. As a quick reminder, that's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. And we're pleased to update you that in Michigan, we have reached a unanimous settlement, and the details will be made public later this week. We expect final commission approval by the end of the year. Meanwhile, we're continuing progress on a number of regulatory -- regulated capital projects. At the beginning of June, we closed on our first option of West Riverside Energy Center for $95 million. This adds 100-megawatt of efficient and combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. As you recall, this plant is in operation and the purchase price was based on book value. And in the next few weeks, we plan to file a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option. We also put 128 megawatts of new natural gas generation online last month. As you recall, we invested $170 million to build this generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The facility uses 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. Elsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris and Darien Solar Battery Parks. The Badger Hollow II site has begun receiving panels using non-Chinese polysilicon. Also, we continue to work on securing custom release of panels from a bonded warehouse in Chicago, and we're still expecting Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year, with Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work has begun on the Darien solar facility, which is planned to go into service in 2024. We'll keep you posted and update on future developments. With that, I'll turn you back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaScott, thanks very much. As you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. We believe this continues to rack our dividend growth in the top decile of our industry. We're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and unveil our third quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.Xia LiuThanks, Gale. Our 2023 2nd quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Our earnings from utility operations were $0.04 above the second quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.05 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These negative variances were more than offset in the quarter. Rate based growth contributed $0.11 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. Additionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.05, and lower day-to-day O&amp;M taxes and other items resulted in a $0.02 improvement. Before I turn to earnings at the other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine , was down 0.6% on a weather-normal basis. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage, again, on a weather-normal basis was flat quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with our forecast. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.4%, which is ahead of forecast. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the second quarter of '23 compared to the second quarter of '22. This was largely driven by higher production tax credits as a result of the acquisition of renewable projects. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.05, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. This was partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&amp;M. Overall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.01 per share compared to last year and by $0.08 per share compared to the midpoint of our Q2 guidance. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat compared to the prior year, and total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion during the first half of 2023, an increase of more than $1 billion from the first half of 2022. This was primarily driven by acquisitions of generation projects in our regulated and infrastructure segment. Now, let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We're expecting a range of $0.88 to $0.90 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.96 per share in the third quarter last year, which included a positive $0.02 from weather and a $0.05 pickup related to the resolution of a MISO ROE complaint. As Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. As a reminder, largely due to timing of O&amp;M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in Q4 to be materially better than Q4 of 2022. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaGreat, Xia. Thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Gale E. KlappaJulien, before we start, I know -- before we start, I know a great puppy trainer, so just let me know Julien, are you still with us?Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithCan you hear me now?Gale E. KlappaWe can, I thought I heard a dog barking in the back there.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithYou can , I am sorry about that. I don't know what happened. I thought I was on mute there, but go figure.Gale E. KlappaI was just saying Julien -- Julien, I was just saying that I know a great puppy trainer, so let me know.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAll right. I'm going to put it duly noted, sir, duly noted. I appreciate it. And by the way, congrats guys on all the updates here. Really nicely done. . And to that effect, when you think about the settlement here in Michigan, how do you think about Illinois here and the ability to settle that out at least in part here, as you get through the bulk of the hearings here in the near term? Any opportunities? And also any thoughts here on the legislative side going into 2024 for gas in Illinois as well?Gale E. KlappaOkay. I appreciate the questions, Julien, very much. Tackle the first 1 first, and that's any potential or possibility for a rate settlement in our Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas cases in Illinois. So as many of you know, the way the process really unfolds during normal rate reviews in Illinois. Historically, settlement windows really don't occur, really don't open until the administrative law judge has prepared a draft order. And if I remember correctly, the schedule for that administrative law judge draft order probably looks like late October, early November. Scott is agreeing that that's the case. So if there's a settlement opportunity, I think those discussions would take place probably in the November time frame, so we'll see. Again, as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, the staff has reiterated its position with a 93% return on equity recommendation and an equity layer higher than what we have at Peoples Gas today. So I hope that responds to your question. And then as far as legislation related to gas in Illinois, we just have to see what takes place. And -- but first things first, we continue to work on a positive resolution of the cases currently pending before the Illinois Commerce Commission. I hope that helps, Julien.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithCertainly does. And then just quickly, if I can. Any thoughts about converts here? I mean I heard your opening comments, Gale. I'm just curious if open to following the trend across the space?Gale E. KlappaYes. As we look at our financing package that we needed to support our new 5-year capital plan, I mean we'll look at it. It could be part of mix. But again, I think it really depends upon the circumstances at the time. We haven't ruled it out. We followed the companies that have used this particular financing. And I think you saw one announced today, as a matter of fact. So we haven't ruled it out. We haven't ruled it in, but it certainly will be part of what we look at going forward.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Gale E. KlappaShar, you didn't do any permanent damage to those Porsches, did you?Shahriar PourrezaYou have to ask Southern company that, not me.Gale E. KlappaWell, I noticed they're taking a charge this quarter, so I was a little worried about what you did down there.Shahriar PourrezaWe'll have to wait for that one, but ... I know you mentioned the Microsoft facility could be in service by late '24, early '25, which obviously that overlaps with your existing 5-year plan through '27. Should we be thinking about Microsoft-related investment as something that's separate and incremental to the current 5-year plan? Or is the focus on maintaining that 7.7% asset-based growth as you manage customer affordability? So in other words, so could other base spending be pushed out to make room for Microsoft-related spending?Gale E. KlappaWell, great question, Shar. And first off, I don't think really, just given the magnitude of the construction, that Microsoft seems to be planning. My own belief is we won't see the Microsoft campus in operation in 2024. I think that's just too much of a stretch. My guess, although the company is still very much in its -- refining its plans, my guess is fourth quarter '25, early '26 would be my guess for the first element of the plan that Microsoft is putting together to be operational. And then secondly, to your question about would the Microsoft investment that we need to make to support their energy needs and reliability, would that investment be incremental to the plan? Absolutely incremental to the plan. I don't think there's any question about that, because it was not in our current 5-year plan. Although there are many moving pieces at this stage of the game, but I would just say this is a really positive, exciting opportunity for a major new high-tech investment in our state.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. So we shouldn't look at it as crowding out other base-related spending as you're managing rates in the [vehicle]?Gale E. KlappaNo, absolutely. I mean think about -- it's a great question, Shar, but I would think about it this way. I mean, clearly, with the way our customer rates are set, demand from Microsoft, I mean essentially, I mean given the rate charges that Microsoft would receive, they will pay their fair share of whatever additional capacity and energy is needed. So it wouldn't be a crowd out type of a factor at all, in my opinion.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. And then just on the equity comments, Gale, I just want to get a little bit of a better sense on timing and the trigger. Is it like would it be Microsoft-related spending? Because I have to imagine if the facility is whatever, '25, '26 facility, the generation needs would be -- before that, transmission and distribution needs would be before that. So what's the trigger for incremental equity? Is it Microsoft? Or is there other things we should be thinking about?Gale E. KlappaI think it's both. I mean certainly, if we need to add significant capacity to support Microsoft's operation here, but there are other things going on. The other economic developments that have occurred for example, I mean, we talk a lot about Haribo but they are now up and running. And they've told us they will produce 132 million pounds of gummy bears in the next 12-month period, so there's a good bit of economic activity going on. So if you think about transmission, and we're going to start to see in the next 5-year plan the impact of trough one from the MISO planning process, so I think we're going to see an uptick in transmission investments. I think we're going to see clearly some additional capacity needed. We need to continue to harden our distribution networks. There are a lot of moving pieces, and all of them moving in a direction of a stronger capital budget. And as Scott and I have talked about, stronger for longer in terms of our continuing growth projections.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. I guess we'll wait for EEI. Should be an interesting update. And for the record, Gale, I did not crash Porsches.Gale E. KlappaRock and roll, Shar.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraJust -- Xia, sorry if I missed it, but what drove the $0.08 variance versus guidance? Like what are the kind of the tailwinds you had which then drove the [Beat] versus your guidance in the quarter?Gale E. KlappaXia told me it was superior management, but she probably has a more granular answer.Xia LiuIt was a little better fuel and quite a bit better O&amp;M, and weather was actually slightly negative compared to normal with better fuel, better O&amp;M and a couple of other items.Durgesh ChopraGot it. So I mean I guess in terms of the guidance for back half of the year, I'm just thinking about like how are you positioned versus your guidance there. I mean, it's better O&amp;M versus your plan, correct?Xia LiuYes. We see quite a bit of O&amp;M tailwind coming in the fourth quarter, so we'll expect to see O&amp;M to be much better than Q4 last year. We expect fuel to be better and additional PTCs and other items, but quite a bit of O&amp;M fuel tailwind in the fourth quarter.Gale E. KlappaAnd Durgesh, just to add on to what Xia's saying. If you recall, there were a number of very significant items in Q4 last year that will not repeat in Q4 this year, so there's a very major difference as we compare the comps for Q4 of 2022 and what we expect to happen in Q4 of this year.Xia LiuAnd remember, we guided 2% to 3% higher on day-to-day O&amp;M this year compared to last year. So you see some quarter-to-quarter variances, but for the year, we still expect that to be 2% to 3% higher than last year.Durgesh ChopraUnderstood. Maybe just, Xia, just -- I know we recently talked about transferability and the implications to FFO, and there was a lot of discussion amongst your peers on how that needs to be -- how that should be treated. Maybe just any additional color or thoughts there or progress you're making with other stakeholders on how are you going to treat the transferability as cash flow?Gale E. KlappaWe'll ask Xia to give you the detail on this, but I would say one very important point to kind of kick off the answer is that our entire industry is really aligned around what we believe is the proper treatment of these ongoing transfers that will happen across the industry, the ongoing sale of production tax credits. And that alignment across the industry has really resulted in I think, Xia, a very thorough and very solid white paper.Xia LiuYes. We -- I developed a very comprehensive white paper. Really outlined the views from FASB from the big 4 accounting firms, from the -- over, like Gale said, the industry. So they shared the white paper with the rating agencies and all that is to say, I think everybody is aligned in terms of we plan to follow GAAP and the transferability will go through income tax provision on income statement, therefore, would be picked up as FFO. So we are looking forward to continuing to work with the rating agencies on this issue. I will say, though, is we would not issue equity just to address that transferability item. So that's something we'll continue to work with rating agencies.Durgesh ChopraGot it. So it sounds like discussion is underway there. I appreciate that color as well.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGale, Xia and Scott, No dogs, no Porsches, but plenty of gummy bears here. Just maybe 2 housekeeping items I had on the PDF Page 12 of your release. Just curious if you could give us some more color. The decline in large commercial industrial sales, and maybe I have the wrong view, I typically view them as maybe like weather agnostic, but yet they've come in 3%. Just thoughts on that?Gale E. KlappaYes. A couple of thoughts, and we'll ask Xia to give you some chapter and verse on some specifics. But 2 things that as we've looked at the data, and again, we have a very granular breakdown of the major industrial sectors that we serve. So let me first say, most people, just as you mentioned, Anthony, look at large commercial and industrial as fairly weather insensitive. Fairly, as you said, fairly weather agnostic. I will say, though, and you've heard me say this a gazillion times, that the weather normalization is more -- it's more precise and accurate. And as we look at kind of backdrop of the economy in Wisconsin, as we look at the jobs that have been added and as we kind of look at the industrial sectors, I would describe the industrial economy in Wisconsin for the first half of 2023 is really fairly flat. There were a couple of major customers who had outages, planned outages, et cetera, that affected the numbers. But the 3% seems, on a weather-normal basis, seems a little draconian to me. I think Scott and I and Xia have already worked through this, and we kind of look at it as kind of first half flat. But having said that, the most recent data is pretty encouraging. Xia?Xia LiuYes. Just to put it in perspective, in Q1, we saw a minus 3.9% quarter-over-quarter. Q2, that number became better to minus 3.1%, like you pointed out, Anthony. I think if you look at Q2 by month, June was fairly close to the forecast. If you look at the last 4 weeks compared to the last 13 weeks or even the prior 4 weeks, we're seeing lots of green. Actually, everything was picking up. So we are very cautiously optimistic that the large C&amp;I will come back in the second half of the year, so nothing to worry too much about. And I would just say that on residential, it's pretty flat year-over-year, and -- but it's fairly better than prior to COVID, and that's the sticky point on the residential usage. Small C&amp;I, actually year-to-date, is on par with last year. So those are higher-margin segments.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGreat. And then just lastly, you've been very clear on what would cause you to issue more equity. Xia, you had said it's not so much to -- if it was to -- I don't want to say, put the words in your mouth, but like the credit agency, it's more for growth. Is it fair to say that if you got to the point where there was more growth that had to be financed that you would finance that -- a cap structure that's probably equal to what you have at the regulated utilities? Or is there an opportunity that you would look to over-equitize, I guess the term some are using, if you had the additional to get some growth going on?Xia LiuI think the first and foremost is we're still developing the capital plan. So the numbers are -- we're still developing it. But like Gale said in his prepared remarks, if growth, capital growth is significantly higher, we wouldn't mind turning on the employee benefit plans, the dribble plans and rely on maybe ATM, but we don't see any block sales at this point, number one. Number two, we are very confident in our long-term EPS growth forecast. We don't expect any equity sales to dilute the long-term EPS growth. And I'll also say that we're very mindful about the rating agencies and we want to work with them, but the equity would be to support growth.Gale E. KlappaAnd a very good description that Xia just made. I will say, she also mentioned and I would just reiterate, for the one item on FFO to debt that might affect our rating at one particular agency, we wouldn't issue equity simply to chase that particular item.Xia LiuThat's the transferability. That's transferability. Yes.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.Gale E. KlappaRock and roll, Michael.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithWanted to just circle back to the Microsoft, and just what you're seeing in terms of long-term sales growth potential there? And then maybe if you could just compare and contrast what this looks like relative to -- there was a lot of excitement around the Foxconn build out a couple of years ago. I know different companies, different situations. But just in terms of how you think about that from a planning standpoint, with another big name company coming to your service territory?Gale E. KlappaYes. Great question, Michael. Let me just phrase it this way. I think we will certainly know by the fall and certainly in time for our new 5-year capital plan, what the next -- what the time period between now and say, 2030 will look like in terms of Microsoft's capacity and energy needs. I mean they are -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks, they are full speed ahead. I mean they purchased the 315 acres in a very short period of time in that technology park, earthwork has already begun, they are still refining their plans. .But everything we're hearing from Microsoft would indicate that they're planning a very major investment here, and they need to do it in a relatively short time frame. So there's really no question in our minds about how strong the intention and how strong the momentum is from the Microsoft development. As it relates to Foxconn, well, back in 2017, they announced a long-term, very, very significant plan. They were talking about 10,000 jobs over 10 to 12 years or 10 to 13 years. They were talking about $10 billion of investment. At this stage of the game, Foxconn, which is working in Area 1 of that park, Foxconn has invested over $1 billion and has over 1,000 employees. So while they have been slower to ramp up and their business plan has changed almost completely from the original thinking, they are still growing in that area. But Microsoft, I think they're really not talking at the moment about a long-term 10 to 15-year plan like Foxconn was. They're talking about, at least at the beginning here, they've called it an initial investment that they really want to get moving on, and that would affect our next 5-year capital plan. Does that respond to your question, Michael?Michael P. SullivanYes. Super helpful. And just as a follow-on, I think someone asked earlier or there's been a couple of questions around new capacity needs and new generation that you might have to build. And given the quick turnaround time, is further delaying any currently-planned retirements contemplated at all if things were looking kind of tight from a time frame perspective?Gale E. KlappaWell, that's a great question, and we're looking at all of that. I'll let Scott give you his view on that.Scott J. LauberSo we're going -- it's a great question. We're going through the planning process right now. We're evaluating what our capacity needs are. And you know MISO has changed is capacity needs over the seasonal approach too, which will also affect our capital plans as we look at it this fall. So right now, nothing to announce. We're just going through the analysis.Gale E. KlappaScott has made a really good point that we shouldn't gloss over though, and that is as MISO has looked at its responsibility to ensure reliability, they really are changing their capacity rules that all of us need to abide by. And it will have a -- we believe it will have a particular effect on our winter capacity reserves. That's all being factored into our new 5-year capital plan.Michael P. SullivanGot it. Okay.OperatorWith that, I will turn the call back over to Gale Klappa for any closing remarks.Gale E. KlappaTerrific. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for being with us. If you have any additional questions, feel free to call Beth Straka. She can be reached most days, no, everyday at (414) 221-4639. Thanks, everybody.

And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Laxman.Story continuesLaxman NarasimhanThank you, Tiffany, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon. In a few moments, Rachel Ruggeri will walk you through the detailed results of the third quarter, and Belinda Wong would then join us for Q&amp;A. To start, our strong third quarter results point to all-around momentum in the business. This quarter, we grew consolidated revenue by 12%, up 14% when excluding more than a 1% impact in foreign currency translation to a record $9.2 billion. Importantly, earnings growth of 19% outpaced revenue growth, with margin expanding by 50 basis points to 17.4%. Our strong performance reflects the strengthened foundation of our business, resulting from the significant progress we are making against our reinvention plan. Since stepping into the role, I have now traveled to every region, working directly with partners. I left each interaction impressed by the differentiated global appeal of the Starbucks brand, powered by innovation and anchored in our unique ability to deliver human connection. These experiences give me great confidence in the significant growth and margin opportunities in front of us, positioning us well to strengthen the brand and create outsized long-term shareholder value. It was this time last year when Howard and the team identified the must-win opportunities and investments for our foundational reinvention plan. While Rachel will walk you through detailed results, I will now outline the momentum we have from the quarter in 5 key priority areas while pointing out where we see further headroom. Our first priority, we will elevate the brand by running great stores. This comes to life in the strengthened execution in North America. Our North America team delivered record revenue in the quarter, with a growth of 11% underpinned by 7% comparable same-store sales growth, leading to the highest average weekly sales in our history. Our ticket growth was driven by pricing, customization and food attach. Additionally, we continue to see improvements in items sold per labor hour. Operationally, we are seeing evidence that we are executing better. Barista attrition, where we are already industry-leading, has improved further by 11% year-over-year. Through scheduling and staffing improvements, we are beginning to increase the number of hours per partner in store, critical to running great stores and improving partner engagement while also improving productivity. Innovation in beverage and equipment continues to drive our business. In fact, our cold business reached 75% of U.S. beverage sales this past quarter. As the leader in premium coffee, we are particularly encouraged to see cold espresso beverages were up 13% year-over-year. Additionally, we continue to elevate the premium coffee experience in both cold and hot. For example, the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewer continues as planned, delivering a larger variety of high-quality hot coffee, including decaffeinated on demand. Our innovative equipment rollout remains on track. Our faster and easier to use portable handheld cold foam blenders continue to have an outsized impact for both the partner and customer experience. The cold foam blenders are now rolled out to all U.S. company-operated stores, in time to meet the summer demand for Starbucks Refreshers' frozen beverages. The new blenders support the additional growth of cold foam, the fastest-growing customization at Starbucks. Modifiers such as cold foam now contribute to over $1 billion in revenue annually. The Mastrena 2 espresso machines and new warming ovens are also now in all U.S. company-operated stores. Taken all together, our equipment investments that we began last year are supporting labor efficiencies, allowing us to increase capacity during our busiest dayparts. These investments are both elevating the Starbucks experience and further differentiating us from competitors. In this past quarter in North America, we once again saw our unit volume outpace pre-COVID levels by double digits, with high attach rates across dayparts: the mornings as well as the afternoons. Also in thinking about dayparts, our Starbucks Refreshers platform, which skews towards an optimal occasion, has seen double-digit growth this past quarter in every daypart. With this success, we are leaning in even further with a systematic pipeline of innovation across dayparts. This includes this summer's launch of our Starbucks Refreshers frozen beverages, customization in our Oleato beverage platform, as well as with our cold-pressed Cold Brew, which enters a testing phase across a few dozen stores this fourth quarter, with a rollout across U.S. company-owned stores expected by the end of fiscal year 2024. Food is also fueling growth. This past quarter, we saw all-time high food attach and sales of breakfast sandwiches. As an attached business, food drove a higher ticket in the quarter, improving volume growth and contributing to the record average weekly sales. Overall, we are excited about the significant opportunity in food as we explore new, elevated and convenient food offerings. We will share more of this in time. We also continue to grow and diversify our store portfolio. We see significant headroom for new store growth in underpenetrated areas in the U.S., including smaller cities as well as new formats in larger metros. New stores and remodels are where we are first prioritizing our Siren System equipment rollout, and we plan to move all stores to brand-forward digital menu boards over the next couple of years to further sharpen personalization and daypart activation. We are seeing strong growth in delivery. In fact, we are close to creating a $1 billion incremental leg in our delivery business from minimal presence a few years ago. And now we are operationally setting ourselves up for this channel in major markets, starting from a position of strength. As a second strategic priority, we're looking ahead at how we will further strengthen and differentiate our leadership position in digital. In the third quarter, we continued to grow our digital universe. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards customers grew to nearly 75 million globally, growing more than 25% in the quarter. This was driven by a record 90-day active user base of 31.4 million Starbucks Rewards customers in the U.S., an approximate 15% growth or 4 million new customers from the previous year. Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S. drove 57% of tender for the second consecutive quarter, up over 3 percentage points from the prior year. In China, we hit the highest number of 90-day active users we have ever had at over 20 million Starbucks Rewards customers. This is further evidence of our brand strength, relevance and customer engagement in the market. Starbucks has had a long track record of industry-leading digital innovation. As we approach the fundamental platform transformation underway with AI, we intend to invest to lead in this area using a foundational Deep Brew capability as the launching pad. Our focus in these investments will remain on improving the partner experience while elevating the customer experience and delivering productivity gains. We are revamping our approach to further accelerate digital innovation, including order, including payment and delivery enhancements, in terms of speed and personalization, which we believe leads to greater habituation by our customers. This includes developments in the U.S. mobile app user experience as well. Additionally, we plan to make significant investments in China to further enhance our digital capabilities in the market. Our third priority is global growth. As a company with over 100 million customer occasions each week, more than 37,000 stores and operating in 86 markets around the world, the runway for global growth is limitless. For the quarter, we again saw double-digit top line growth across the International segment. The segment delivered record system sales for the second consecutive quarter as well as the highest revenue and operating margin since the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, we continue to see double-digit growth in the company-owned markets of Japan and the U.K. while our geographic license partners across the rest of the world all reported very strong performance. Our international store growth was 10% year-over-year. New stores are bringing attractive unit economics for the business while we benefit from strong growth in returns on invested capital in these markets. Turning to China. I am encouraged by our performance in the quarter. I had the opportunity to spend time in the market recently. I can now fully appreciate the extraordinary strength and resilience of the Starbucks brand, which is known as Xingbake locally. Looking at our third quarter results, our China revenue grew 51% from the prior year or up 60% when excluding a 9% impact of foreign currency translation. Additionally, we sequentially grew our revenue 8% from the prior quarter or up 10% when excluding a 2% impact of foreign currency translation, underscoring the robust long-term health of our business. Despite these being early days in our recovery journey, stores that opened in fiscal year 2019 or earlier achieved full sales recovery in the routine morning daypart while other dayparts reported sequential monthly improvement. A strong recovery in the third quarter was amplified by the many distinctive competitive advantage that set us apart in China. The first and foremost advantages are in comparable partners who honor the heritage of our company, bring sophisticated appreciation for our high-quality coffee and passion for delivering the Starbucks experience in ways that are relevant to our Chinese customers. Our second advantage is our vertically integrated operations. We start with a locally relevant and increasingly greener store footprint. Our distinctively designed stores across formats celebrate the Chinese culture in a unique Xingbake manner, reflecting local arts, crafts and calligraphy. In the fall, we plan to open our Coffee Innovation Park, our single largest and most sustainable manufacturing investment outside of the U.S. This next-generation facility with state-of-the-art supply chain operations will also include a unique customer immersion center. Third, our locally relevant innovation in China for over 20 years has won over customers in what has historically been a tea-drinking culture. Today, we have nearly 6,500 stores and another nearly 2,400 points of customer connection through our We Proudly Serve Program in China. And yes, there is so much more opportunity ahead in underpenetrated areas within this market. Some growth facts to think about. The average person in China drinks 12 cups of coffee each year. That's significantly lower coffee consumption than in Tier 1 cities like Shanghai, where we first entered the market and now have nearly 1,100 stores. And we still have more room to grow in Shanghai. Compare this also to Japan where our per capita is 200 cups versus the 12 cups in China, and the U.S. where the per capita is closer to 380. We're still in our early days in China, one of the largest consumer markets. With our locally-based investments in R&amp;D and locally relevant offerings like our Dragon Dumplings, which had an amazing quarter, we have built a brand that is highly relevant for China, in China. And we believe our unique approach has us well positioned to play the long game and win. Finally, another advantage in China is digital. This will be further demonstrated with highly digital supply chains we run and in the way we engage our customers. We are reshaping our business models, leaning into the remarkable loyalty of our Starbucks Rewards members as well as convenience offerings, including delivery and curbside for our on-the-go business. A comment on our international business beyond the U.S. and China. We have seen very strong growth and strong unit economics in these markets. It is becoming an important third leg for us. Looking outside the stores in the third quarter, our Channel Development segment revenue was $449 million, down 6% year-over-year, while delivering operating margin of 46.3%, up 630 basis points year-over-year, reflecting SKU rationalization as well as the shifts taking place with a more on-the-go customer. We continue to see the opportunity for growth in channel-through innovation, as evidenced by the highly successful ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink, introduced last quarter, and the Grab and Go series launched in Japan in partnership with Suntory. We saw unprecedented sales during the first month of the launch in Japan, just as we did with our cream cheese lattes in China. Our fourth strategic priority is fueling productivity. We think of our business as a theater in the front and a factory in the back. We have a clear opportunity to maximize efficiencies and effectiveness while reducing waste by focusing on a vast opportunity in stores and also above stores. We have focused on meaningful improvements in staffing and scheduling to ensure that we have the right combination of the right partners in the right roles with the right hours to fuel both engagement and productivity. We also closed the third quarter on target with our waste reduction goals as we strive to make operations as efficient as possible while preserving the Starbucks Experience. This is just the beginning of the productivity journey at Starbucks. We have broadened the areas beyond our initial reinvention plan to include our end-to-end supply chain, direct and indirect procurement, how we design and build stores as well as opportunities across technology and our supporting processes. Arthur Valdez, Jr., who joined us recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer, brings 3 decades of supply chain and logistics leadership to Starbucks, and will be critical in these efforts. Along with sales leverage, what I could see in opportunities with future productivity gains gives me real confidence in long-term progressive margin expansion. Finally, the DNA of Starbucks is nothing without our culture. This is inherent to the company and something I was quick to learn through my immersion and experience working in stores. Our fifth strategic priority is reinvigorating our culture of human connection. We will measure our success on our business performance through the lens of humanity, just as we always have. And that requires us to reinvigorate our culture. Our partners are the heart of our business for me. We will continue to invest in the overall partner experience through compensation and benefits as well as through in-store improvements. At Starbucks, we strive to be a different kind of company, but we do recognize that we are operating in a different kind of world. It is through that lens we have spent the last several months rolling out a new unifying mission for the company, new promises for all our stakeholders and soon, a new set of values that will reground the culture of Starbucks in our heritage and a more modernized workplace. Before I turn the call over to Rachel, I want to leave you with this. It is an honor to be driving such a stellar branded company in one of its best chapters. While we continue to navigate in an environment with a heightened level of macro uncertainty around the world, we will execute with discipline and rigor on our priorities. After all, Starbucks is a strong, resilient brand delivering to customers what the world needs most right now: human connection. As I look at the runway in front of us, the possibilities to deliver that connection are truly limitless. What I see is a durable iconic business with multiple paths available for us to deliver on our long-term revenue growth of 10% to 12% and earnings growth of 15% to 20%. I look forward to discussing our strategies and plans for fiscal year 2024 and beyond in greater detail in November in an extended investor call organized in a hybrid media format. We would share more details in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rachel to talk more about our remarkable third quarter financial performance of the quarter. Rachel?Rachel RuggeriThank you, Laxman, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to discuss our Q3 performance, which beat our expectations as our innovation and our brand continues to resonate with our customers around the world, fueling demand across our stores and digitally. Our U.S. business delivered record-breaking performance on many fronts, and our China business continued to recover in line with our expectations. It's clear we have abundant opportunity ahead. Our overall performance was bolstered by the progress we're making against our strategies, specifically our reinvention plan, and it's unfolding into tangible financial results. As a reminder, when we set guidance at the beginning of the year, we said that the benefits from our reinvention plan would amplify at the back half of this fiscal year. And that is exactly what we're seeing, highlighting our ability to effectively reinvest in our business for the benefit of all stakeholders. Our Q3 consolidated revenue reached a record $9.2 billion, up 12% from the prior year or up 14% when excluding more than 1% impact of foreign currency translation. The strength of the brand, loyalty of our customers and innovative products fueled strong sales resulting in double-digit consolidated comparable store sales growth of 10%. In addition to the 10% comparable store sales growth, revenue also benefited from 7% net new company-operated store growth globally year-over-year as well as continued momentum in our global licensed market. Q3 consolidated operating margin expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.4%, exceeding our expectations, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. Margin expansion was partially offset by investments in store partners as well as higher G&amp;A costs in support of reinvention. Q3 EPS was $1, up 19% from the prior year, driven by strong performance across our business segments, demonstrating the power of a broad global portfolio. I'll now provide segment highlights for Q3. North America delivered another record quarter of revenue with $6.7 billion in Q3, up 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales, consisting of 6% and 1% growth in average ticket and transactions, respectively, as well as net new company-operated store growth of 4% year-over-year. Our results were further strengthened by the continued momentum from our licensed store business. Our U.S. business delivered 7% comparable store sales growth in Q3, primarily driven by solid ticket performance with 6% growth, which benefited from a combination of pricing, food attach and customization. Our customers have relatively adopted the practice of customizing their beverages, allowing for a more personalized and differentiated experience while contributing to a growing higher-margin ticket with abundant opportunity ahead. In Q3, over 60% of beverages were customized, representing a 9% growth when compared to just 5 years ago. Cold foam, for example, continues to be a customization favorite. This quarter's all-time high food attach was driven by 2 of every 5 customers attaching food with their orders, up over 25% from just 5 years ago, driven by our delicious breakfast sandwiches leading to an all-time high ticket in the quarter. Transaction comparable sales growth in the quarter was 1%, which combined with record ticket drove the highest average weekly sales in our company's history, surpassing the all-time high set during holiday in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We are seeing more customers come into our stores with customer counts up 5% year-over-year, in line with the record high set in Q1 of this fiscal year. Our growing tech-enabled convenience capabilities are driving our customers to engage more deeply with Starbucks, as evidenced by the growth in customization, attach and mix shift towards more premium beverages, leading to record demand and incremental higher-margin revenue. Another proof point of our continued demand is the ongoing success of our Starbucks Rewards Program, which ended the quarter achieving records on many fronts: a record number of active members, spend per member and total member spend. These records alone reflect the stickiness of our business, but we are most pleased by the consistency of our customer connection stores, which highlights customer satisfaction and the delivery of the Starbucks Experience. U.S.-licensed stores revenue continued its momentum this quarter, up 21% from the prior year, with strength across the portfolio and benefiting from increases in post-COVID travel, especially return of business travel, which benefits from Starbucks Connect, our digital offering, now rolled out across all major U.S. airports. North America's operating margin was 21.8% in Q3, contracting 40 basis points from the prior year, as expected, primarily driven by the timing of productivity-focused labor investments as part of our reinvention plan. For color, the reinvention investments included partner wages and benefits as well as an increase in targeted partner training. The contraction was partially offset by favorable impacts of pricing, coupled with labor productivity and sales leverage largely from the ramping benefits of the reinvention plan. Moving on to International. In the quarter, the segment delivered $2 billion in revenue, the highest revenue since Q4 of fiscal year 2021, up 24% from the prior year or up 30% when excluding more than 5% impact from foreign currency translation. Our revenue growth reflects double-digit growth in all major markets, including China, which benefited from lapping prior year mobility restrictions. The growth is attributable to a 24% increase in comparable store sales, which was driven by 21% transaction growth as customers continued returning to our stores, largely in China, as well as remarkable digital engagement through the increasing Starbucks Rewards member base. In addition, the International segment delivered 11% net new company-operated store growth year-over-year, with China contributing a significant portion of store growth as we continue to invest ahead of the curve in China, supporting our long-term ambitions for the market. Excluding China, our international markets combined continued their strong momentum, with revenue growing 11% year-over-year in Q3 or up 14% when excluding a 3 percentage impact from foreign currency translation. The meaningful growth was a byproduct of our successful innovation and digital engagement across various markets. Excluding China, International had 8% store growth year-over-year, and approximately 35% of our new stores year-to-date were drive-thru, resulting in approximately 15% of total store count having the drive-through channel, furthering our ability to create new occasions and serve new customers globally. Shifting to China. China had a strong quarter, delivering their highest beverage sales for Q3 over the last 5 years, underpinned by comparable store sales growth of 46% in Q3, in line with our expectations. Comp growth was driven by strong transactions, which benefited from the lapping prior year Q3 mobility restrictions. As the market continues to recover, we're pleased with the consistency of demand fueled by new product innovation, increasing digital capability, record sales of our Dragon Dumplings festival food and an acceleration of new store openings amounting to nearly 3 stores per day. Average weekly sales in China grew quarter-over-quarter, and we expect this to continue into Q4 with average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits, resulting in similar-sized comp growth for the quarter. With the current demand and the long-term opportunity we see in China, we continue to invest in our stores, partners and communities, and we'll have our largest roasting plant outside of the U.S., the Coffee Innovation Park, opening this fall. Our unwavering investments have contributed to our healthy recovery and performance, positioning us well for the long term. Operating margin for the International segment was 19% in Q3, expanding an impressive 660 basis points from the prior year, mainly driven by sales leverage from lapping prior year mobility restrictions in China, partially offset by investments in digital and partner wages as well as inflationary pressures. Shifting to Channel Development. The segment's revenue contracted 6% year-over-year to $449 million in Q3, driven largely by at-home coffee while proudly holding the #1 share position at 15.1%. Despite the softening of revenue, the segment remained strong due to the breadth and depth of the portfolio. We are particularly proud of our North American coffee partnership, which continued to see category-leading sales and share growth outpacing the total category. Our innovation continues to distinguish us while benefiting the segment overall with strong performance. A perfect example of this is the award-winning ready-to-drink Starbucks Pink Drink and Starbucks Paradise Drink that Laxman mentioned earlier. The segment's operating margin was 46.3% in Q3, up a resounding 630 basis points from prior year, driven by strength in the North America coffee partnership and sales mix shift. As previously shared, operating margin has returned to the segment's normal mid-40s range, a testament of our strong partnerships and the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Now moving to guidance for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Given we're in the final quarter of our fiscal year with clear visibility into full year results, combined with the momentum we've built, the pace of reinvention plan unfolding and the strength of our global portfolio, we have the confidence to move our full year earnings growth from the plans we shared in November of the low end of the 15% to 20% growth range to a growth of 16% to 17% for full year fiscal year 2023. Despite the macroeconomic environment variables, we are poised to move our earnings growth guidance as it reflects the strength of our brand globally and the long-term durability that we are building through our reinvention plan. As it relates to our remaining guidance, we are pleased to reaffirm full year guidance on all other measures. As a reminder, that includes revenue growth of 10% to 12%, global comp growth near the high end of 7% to 9% and solid margin expansion. Store growth, capital spend and tax rate guidance also remain unchanged from what we shared previously. As a reminder, we expect an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2 to 3 percentage points on fiscal year 2023 revenue and earnings, respectively. With that, let me provide further detail around our Q4. First, in regard to International. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect our International segment Q4 margin to expand year-over-year, but to be meaningfully lower than Q3 due to seasonality along with accelerated digital and store renovation investments. Second, in regard to China, as I noted earlier, we expect China's average weekly sales to continue to sustain the growth quarter-over-quarter, resulting in average weekly sales growth of low to mid-single digits in Q4, with similar sized comp growth as the market is lapping government stimulus for customers and favorable discounting from prior year, coupled with the timing of difference of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which all contributed to prior year transaction growth. We continue to expect a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis, consistent with our prior guidance, as well as record-breaking year of net new store development. Finally, as it relates to Channel Development, we expect revenue pressures to continue in Q4, driven largely by the at-home coffee business as customer behavior shift with revenue expected to be largely flat to prior year. However, we expect margins will continue to be above the mid-40s range, driven by seasonality, leveling to a strong mid-40s margin business for the full year. In summary, here are my key takeaways from my discussion today. Our momentum is in full swing and our strong brand, successful product innovations and financial and operational performance across the globe is a testament to our focus and our discipline. Our reinvention plan investments are unfolding and providing tangible returns throughout our business. As a result of our solid performance, our full year fiscal year 2023 guidance, including revenue, has been reiterated and we are confident to move our earnings growth to 16% to 17% for full year fiscal 2023. Finally, I want to say thank you to our partners around the globe for showing up every day and making customer's day brighter by an extending active kindness. It's because of you that the future is truly limitless. With that, we'll open the call to Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays.Jeffrey Andrew BernsteinGreat. I had one question and then just one clarification to Laxman's comments. The question is just on the U.S. comp and traffic. It looks like the traffic was modestly positive this quarter, slowing a little bit from last quarter. And I think it's safe to say that there's going to be some slowing in the menu pricing in forward quarters, and therefore, the average ticket. So with the comp slowing and the average ticket likely to slow, I'm just wondering your confidence in the current algorithm for that 7% to 9% comp looking into next year. And the clarification is just, Laxman, I think you mentioned that you would update long-term guidance when you report the fiscal fourth quarter. But with that said, I think you did mention the 10% to 12% revenue growth long term and 15% to 20% EPS growth. So is that safe to say that those are levels you're comfortable with as we look out into future years or all things are on the table as you offer your initial guidance next quarter?Laxman NarasimhanWell, there were several questions in there so let me just break this up. There was a question on the third quarter. There was a question about our expectations for the balance of the year. And then there was a question about the -- what I've said earlier about my confidence in the multiple paths to achieving the 10% to 12% growth as well as the 15% to 20% earnings growth, and I'll comment on all 3. So let me first start with Q3. Q3 for us was a very strong quarter, as Rachel mentioned as well. It's in line with our expectations. Our comps were consistent every month. We came off a lap in Q2, which was the impact of Omicron, and so we had a 7% comp, very consistent month-over-month. The comp in Q3 was lapping a 9% comp from last year, so it's a 16% comp on a 2-year basis. And so if you look at this, it's really the strength of the brand, the actions and pricing we took, but also the growing levels of customization and the levels of food attach that Rachel mentioned as well. And that is what led to the average weekly sales in Q3 continuing to break records. Now your question on transactions. Transactions in Q3 grew year-over-year across all dayparts. Traffic is below 2019 levels, but units per store are above the 2019 average coming from higher food attach. So the food growth along with more customization and judicious price increases led to this record weekly sales that you saw in the quarter. So transactions, as I said, have grown year-over-year across all dayparts. We also had a strong increase in ticket. There's a sort of balance between the pricing, which is very judicious, but also customization and increase in the number of units. Delivery sales doubled in Q3 compared to a year ago, most of which is incremental occasions for our customers. So that's Q3. Let me just highlight something about our loyal customers because that, in some ways, gives you a sense of the strength of the brand. Our 90-day active Starbucks Rewards members have grown 4 million in number year-over-year. They come in more frequently, they buy more. And interestingly enough, as we've seen our sizes, we actually see the growth of our largest sizes over our smaller sizes. So we're not seeing the down-trading in our customer base. Our stored value credit, the balance of the card, is also growing sequentially. That's how we exit Q3. As you look at the balance of the year, we feel that, first of all, the annualization of the pricing actions will continue. We don't have any lagging significant comp impacts from the previous year. And we do expect pricing trends to moderate as we go into the final quarter, as you said, but we do expect to end the year in line with the comp expectations of 7% to 9% growth that we had set. Now in terms of answering your question about the long term, the -- what I have seen in both top line as well as in the earnings growth gives me real confidence in the fact that what we've guided to previously, the 10% to 12% revenue growth and the earnings growth of 15% to 20%, we have multiple paths to getting to that. So that just really signals the resilience of the business, the durability of the brand and the multiple paths we see, both in terms of top line as well as earnings growth, which I'm happy to elaborate on.OperatorYour next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.Sharon ZackfiaI was curious about the comments on the number of hours per partner. Can you give us kind of some color around where that is now and where you'd like that to be in the U.S., how long you think it takes to get there and kind of what the associated productivity improvements would be? I assume that's throughput related, but would love some color on that.Laxman NarasimhanSo we're feeling very good about the progress we are making in this area. Our foundational reinvention plan that we announced last year is essential to the improvements that we're seeing now. We're making very good progress on it. There are meaningful improvements in the store environment as well as the productivity gains that we're making. Our equipment rollout is on track. Our peaks are growing faster than the rest of the dayparts. And we're making strong progress on the scheduling and staffing basis. If you look on the retail team, barista turnover is down, as I said, 9% reduction versus previous year, a 2% reduction versus just the second quarter. And what you see is the combination of investments as well as the scheduling improvements that we're making, the economic proposition, the take-home pay to our baristas has improved by 20% year-over-year and we have more improvements coming. And you're going to see us make improvements month-over-month in terms of the improvements that we're making. I mean we're going to ensure that we continue to increase these average hours through better staffing and scheduling, but also work to accommodate their preferences, including the many that we attract who are keen on a part-time schedule. So this is progress that we're making week over week, month over month, and there's more to come next year.OperatorYour next question comes from Andrew Charles, TD Cowen.Andrew Michael CharlesIt's a 2-part question on China. Belinda, it's hard to ignore the amount of discount activity in China by competitive coffee shops, that one competitor indicated earlier today will persist for a number of years. And so curious if you can talk about new strategies in place for Starbucks to help protect traffic without degrading the brand's premium status.And then my other question is either for Rachel or Laxman, but you mentioned margin headroom a couple of times. Amid that volatile China macro, what are the offsets if the model -- China's performance weakens? In the 10-Q, I know you called out a sequential increase in North America productivity improvements from 2Q. So maybe that's perhaps an area where there's more to grow or perhaps there's another area that I'm not thinking about that allows for some cushion in the model if we were to see China macro become a little bit more uncertain.Laxman NarasimhanGot it. I'll get Belinda to take the first question, Rachel to take the second, and then I'll come in with some summary comments at the end. Belinda?Ching Ying WongGreat. Thank you for your question, Andrew. First of all, I want to say that there's no noticeable impact to our sales performance in Q3. In fact, we're very -- I'm very happy with our Q3 performance and the sequential improvement that we achieved. We have been and will continue to stay focused and disciplined in our discount investment to optimize and deliver incremental return.On the competition topic, we welcome competition. They actually expand the coffee market and accelerate adoption and the frequency of coffee consumption. Different brands bring in different value propositions and occasions, and I just want to talk about our value propositions. We're in the human connection business. Since day one 24 years ago, when we entered China, we have been focusing on delivering a premium experience defined by the quality of our coffee and the emotional experience we've built with our customers and our partners that can't be replicated anywhere else.And our China business has strategically built to serve a diverse range of customer needs and occasions, physical and digital, fast and slow. And the unique business model and capabilities we have built that Lex has mentioned gives us distinctive competitive advantages. So we'll double down on our investment in our product innovation store experience, digitalization in our people to create even more distinctive advantages to capture the limitless opportunities in China in the future. Thank you. We're playing the long game.Laxman NarasimhanRachel?Rachel RuggeriYes. And Andrew, I would just follow that up with as we look at the performance in China, we're encouraged by the healthy margins that we're seeing today. And even as we see a shift more towards digital, which does have a lower margin percentage overall, it's driving more revenue. And that's no better way to drive margin expansion than through sales leverage, so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today.In addition to that, the team has been very judicious about creating operational efficiencies. So the margin opportunity in China continues to be healthy. That said, if we do see that there are challenges in the future, we've structured our guidance such that it allows us room, which is one of the reasons why we're very intentional and being more directive around qualitative language on margins, saying this year would be solid margin expansion and the future would be progressive, which will allow us to continue to navigate the business and continue to invest where needed so that we can deliver on that 15% to 20% earnings growth that we've guided to.Laxman NarasimhanWell, let me just close with a couple of observations. I was in the China market for an extended period in this quarter. And I got to actually work with our partners and stores. I got to spend time in our supply chain. I got to spend time in our support centers, including looking at our teams that are leading what we do in digital. And I have to tell you, I've been going to China, studying China, advising on China, running business with China for 20 years. And this is a very unique business. It's been a business that's been built with love, and it's remarkable in terms of the passion our partners have. I was very impressed.I think it is still early days. I mean when you start looking at the headroom you have, and as Belinda said, the headroom is large. So as people come into the market, they're essentially driving a conversion of tea to coffee, which of course, remember, for 20 years, we've been doing and we've got to 12 cups per capita. The numbers, by the way, significantly higher in Shanghai, but it's still much lower than a tea drinking country like Japan, which has had a history of coffee house culture over time. So the headroom is really large.If you look at what we also do with our brand, don't forget, we have these -- we proudly serve a Starbucks points of customer connection. In addition, our ready-to-drink partnership with Tingyi is also growing significantly. And we're also available for coffee at home, so our brand is being built across multiple channels. And the investments we're making in digital are very strong.With the investments we're making to more vertically integrate our supply chain, it gives a greater flexibility in China and also greater productivity. So I think in addition to that, your other question on productivity, as I look at what I see with regard to the opportunities we have both in the stores and at out stores, and that, by the way, cuts across all the whole business, we have further productivity opportunities, which give us confidence on margin in terms of the progressive margin improvement that we have made. So early days in China, market going to expand and further opportunities for us to get productivity.OperatorYour next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.Brian James HarbourI wanted to ask just about the point on kind of supply chain and procurement. I think you guys have been pretty clear on the labor side, what the opportunity is there, what you're doing. Could you elaborate though just more on the supply chain side and where you see the most opportunity there, how that factors into where you think margins can go?Laxman NarasimhanGreat. I'll take that. As I look at what we've been working on over the last 6 months or so, it's very clear that the investments we're making in our stores is yielding the kind of productivity that you would see, the efficiency as well as the throughput that we get. But what is interesting is if you look end to end, we have opportunities pretty much everywhere, both in terms of what we buy, how we buy it, how we flow products to stores, the services that we provide to our business, the technology investments that we're making, we have opportunities everywhere.And I think that's part of the reason why you see we've added Arthur Valdez to the team. And just an example, the availability of breakfast sandwiches went up over the course of the last quarter. And what you see, as a consequence of that, is the attach rates went up as a result of it. And so I think that those are just examples of the kind of improvements we're seeing. Clearly, we're seeing benefits, as you know, with regard to freight and the cost of it.And the ability for us to rethink how we do what we do is large. And so there is opportunity there for us in terms of bringing automation in, flowing products better, buying better and, frankly, developing a supply base that can also keep up with the kind of scale and growth plans that we have.OperatorYour next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.David Sterling PalmerI had a question on transaction growth and what you've seen in your Rewards membership. And I'm wondering if there's an insight there over time, since 2019, you've had over 80% increase in your active Rewards membership. It's 15% higher than a year ago. And you noted that transactions were up 1% in the quarter and down versus 4 years ago. So it looks like maybe frequency is down. Maybe the consumer is using you differently, consolidating orders, certainly bolstering the check by having more items per order.But are you seeing any sort of solves from a marketing standpoint? You have very good visibility into what your consumers are doing. You have over half of your orders, you know your consumer and you see what they're doing and the frequency they're coming. So I'm wondering about the tools you see from a consumer side versus some of the more operational stuff you've been talking about as ways to unlock growth.Laxman NarasimhanI think, first of all, let me just clarify something. In your question, I think you suggested -- you made a couple of comments about our Starbucks Rewards members. Let me just give you -- let me just address that. We have more of them, so we had a 4 million growth year-over-year. It's a 15% growth. Our Starbucks Rewards members come in more frequently. So they're not coming in less frequently, they come in more frequently. They buy more after joining the program, right? And as I said, they're also choosing larger sizes as they come in.The investments we have made in marketing and what we're doing with digital, in particular, what it tells you is that we are even further increasing the pace at which we are bringing innovation and changes in terms of what we do. We have a whole list of benefits that we could bring. And we're taking up the agility in the company in terms of the investments we make, which will help us make this even bigger and stronger. So that's the way I would address your question about the Starbucks Rewards members. It's a key area of growth.The other thing you should be aware of is as we have scaled this, we have scaled this to connect, which is all our licensed stores. And I think 40% of our licensed stores today have connect, and we're seeing growth in our license business as well as a consequence of that. Finally, we're scaling this globally. You're seeing us take it to our geographic partners, the Starbucks Digital Solutions. There is very strong adoption.And you see the kind of results you see, which our geographic license partners are announcing or are sharing with us. I mean, very strong results, and Starbucks Digital Solutions is extremely capable of delivering that. In China, we're seeing real growth there, too. And in fact, that is where we're making a big investment as well in digital because we see that as a way not just to strengthen our relationship, but also to drive results through what we do with digital.So I think overall, this is a big area. It's a big area of focus for me. And it's part of the second big priority for us around strengthening and scaling digital. I'll make a last comment. We have a fundamentally amazing capability called Deep Brew inside the company. It's where we have made investments in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I think the ability for us to be at the vanguard of this and to early adopt what we do in this area, furthermore given all the innovations that are going on and the re-platforming that's going on, just gives me greater confidence in what we do in digital. This will be a key area of growth for us.OperatorYour next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.John William IvankoeI was hoping that if you could address the biggest opportunities to kind of regrow same-store transactions versus 2019. I mean what those -- I guess, as you see kind of the bigger opportunities to be, whether in daypart or specific type of customer. And secondly, with same-store traffic up 1%, do you feel like you are specifically addressing peak hour throughput? In other words, is the factory part of Starbucks, as you would call it, properly set up? I mean is the engine specifically running such that you can achieve all those peak hour transactions, especially where mobile orders might be coming in at a very short amount of time.Laxman NarasimhanJohn, thank you for the question. Let me first start with your peak question. We're doing definitely better than what we did before because of the investments that we are making, but we still have further headroom. And I think as we make more investments as we sort of further refine how we think about scheduling and staffing, how we ensure that we get the flows right in our store, we will have the ability to take that up even further. So the daypart -- the peak dayparts are actually growing and growing really well. Now to answer your question about opportunities, there's opportunity pretty much across the board. If I look at beverage and beverage innovation, terrific, strong innovation coming, more to come. If I look at dayparts, we have opportunities in the afternoon daypart. And our Starbucks Refreshers is a way for us to attack that.And as you know, we have -- it's a big and sizable business, but it doesn't yet fully meet the full needs of what we could do in the afternoon. If I look at food attach, it's at the highest level we've had, but we have the ability for us to continue to elevate and innovate in food in order for us to further grab the opportunity that we have there. Delivery is an opportunity that, as I said, it's just early days. I mean we've also built a $1 billion leg. And that's just the U.S. If I look at China, too, it's growing enormously. So we have a leg there too in terms of what we can do with delivery. And furthermore, I said earlier that we actually have an opportunity with regard to the net store growth in the U.S. There's real headroom for us to also locate our stores where we see customer growth, smaller towns, different geographies, and we're clearly looking at all of it not just with our own stores, but also with licensed stores. So John, it's a pretty rich set of areas as I look at growth and what we could get that is available for us, and this is just North America.OperatorYour next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.Peter Mokhlis SalehGreat. I just wanted to come back to North America operating margins. Could you maybe give us a sense of some of the drivers of North America operating margins going forward, maybe in order of magnitude? Do you see a path back to, if not, exceeding pre-pandemic levels? And then I guess, within that, do you feel like the mix of drive-throughs maybe heavier on drive-throughs these days versus where you were pre-pandemic? Does that help push the operating margins back up and above pre-pandemic levels?Rachel RuggeriThis is Rachel. Thank you for the question. We've been encouraged by the performance we've seen in North America, both on the top line and on the bottom line. And year-to-date in North America, we're sitting at about 19.9% margin, with about 40 basis points of expansion, and that's driven by a combination of sales leverage, pricing, the benefits from the reinvention plan showing up in productivity, which is helping to offset some of the investments we've made. And we see opportunity to continue to expand margin over the long term as the benefits of the reinvention continue to amplify.And so I would look at that as really the reinvention is a significant driver of our opportunity in terms of margin expansion. Through reinvention, we're unlocking capacity to be able to serve demand that leads to sales leverage. And in addition to that, we're creating efficiency and resiliency in the middle of the business that's also supporting margin expansion.So I look at it more about what we've already seen progress today with reinvention, what we would expect to see going forward. And that leads us to solid margin expansion at the company level this year and progressive margin expansion in the future, which of course, will be driven in large part by North America.Laxman NarasimhanI just want to say one thing. I think we're at the top of the hour, but there are a few more questions online. And so we're going to go over and take those questions.OperatorAnd your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.Sara Harkavy SenatoreA question and then maybe a point of clarification. I know, Rachel, you talked about the high end of the 7% to 9% same-store sales guide for the full year. But there's a lot going on, still some reopening tailwinds perhaps in China. Certainly, I think in the past, you've talked about even in other markets with more travel. So kind of being at the high end of that range, I guess I'm trying to think through kind of the sustainability, especially insofar as the first half in the U.S. was -- looks like it will be substantially higher than the second half. So trying to just make sure I'm understanding how you're thinking about the ongoing comp.And then the question I have, Laxman, you mentioned unit growth. I think in the past, when Starbucks has accelerated unit growth, there have been periods where it's kind of coincided with slower traffic and ultimately kind of a need to rationalize the store base or reset it. What are the guardrails in place to change that this time around to make sure the unit growth doesn't conflict with continued traffic growth in your existing stores?Laxman NarasimhanDo you want to take the first one?Rachel RuggeriSure. Thanks, Sara. I'll take the first question around comp. And when we look at the balance of the year related to comp, we just expect the momentum in the business to continue. So when you think about in North America in this current quarter, we were encouraged by the fact that our growth in comp was a combination of transaction growth. So we saw transactions grow above prior year in every single daypart. And that was coupled with an elevated ticket. And that was a combination of not only strategic pricing but a balanced contribution from increased customization as well as record attach.That drove strong growth in the quarter that, I would say, from a revenue standpoint, we have fundamentals from a revenue perspective that are broad. And we would expect that to continue, that momentum to continue as we look at the balance of the year and going on a full year basis. So that will continue to be fueled through innovation as well as through continued growth in our digital customer rewards membership and our increasing capability around convenience, including growth in digital. So we see all of that as signs to help support the 7% to 9% comp range that we've guided on a full year basis.Now when you think about outside of North America, we'd say we expect our recovery to sustain in China, and that was through the guidance I gave around a low to mid-single-digit comp on a full year basis as well as contribution from International and the momentum we're seeing. So we think across the board, the momentum we're seeing, the recovery in China, coupled with the strong performance we're seeing in North America, gives us the confidence to be able to maintain the 7% to 9% of comp range on a full year basis for North America and then at the high end of the range for total company.Laxman NarasimhanSara, to your question about our store network and how we see it, I am not concerned. I mean I think there's a very small number of stores that you would normally consider -- that we would consider in the normal course of business that we would look at and say we may have a challenge with them. But there's nothing in there that concerns me. What I'm looking at more from the standpoint of net store growth are the opportunities we have to further enhance our presence in many markets where we are underpenetrated, but also exposed in some of our core markets, multiple formats. I think we've referenced this before as purpose-driven formats in terms of what we can bring into markets in order to meet various needs that customers have.OperatorYour next question comes from Joshua Long with Stephens.Joshua C. LongA couple of times in your prepared commentary, you referenced some what would sound like to be normalizing demand within the at-home coffee channel within Channel Development. So just curious if you could unpack that a little bit. I'm just curious if you're seeing shifts within the portfolio on that side or if that's kind of an ongoing shift back into kind of retail brick-and-mortar as we get back to kind of return to office. Or just additionally, any sort of commentary you can provide there in terms of how you're attacking that and capturing share as the shifts continue to unfold.Laxman NarasimhanRight. We have very strong share in out-of-home coffee. I think we're tied for #1, so we feel good about that. At the same time, what you are seeing with the customer is the customer is becoming more on-the-go. And what you are seeing with that is if you stop looking at channels where we have products like we have with our North American coffee partnership, or frankly, our stores or our licensed stores, we're clearly benefiting from more from customers on-the-go. So you see some of that shift take place. But at-home coffee, our shares are very strong.Rachel RuggeriBut I would add that we are seeing a balance in the portfolio. So that's one of the things we're encouraged by is that while we are seeing consumer behavior shift some, we're seeing an increase in our ready-to-drink both domestically and internationally. And that's helping to support the margin expansion we saw in this quarter and the mid-40s margin that we're guiding to on a full year basis. So I would say in this case, it's the strength of the diversified portfolio that's working to our advantage.OperatorYour next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.Danilo GargiuloJust a question on the Siren System in the United States. How many stores have the Siren System today? And is the number on track with your internal expectations? And what kind of uplift in productivity margin is this initial rollout hinting at?Laxman NarasimhanRachel?Rachel RuggeriYes. From a Siren System standpoint, we're in the -- just the testing phase today. We're on track to be able to launch in conjunction with our renovations in new stores next year. And next year, we expect to be less than 10% of our stores will have the Siren System, reaching about 40% of our stores by the year 2026. And so we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing, we're seeing good results, and we do expect it will help lead to margin expansion in the future. It will be one of the many, what I'd say, equipment investments we're making as well as the investments we're making in the staffing and scheduling within our stores as well as the overall operational excellence focus that the team has. The combination of all of that in North America will lead to a more stabilized production environment, which will help drive margin expansion well into the future. And so we're encouraged by what we're seeing today and we're looking forward to furthering the launch.Laxman NarasimhanJust one thing I'd add to is our pipeline of equipment innovation is very strong. And the way we manage the portfolio, the way we manage the pipeline is very strong. And if you look at some of the commitments that we have made around investments like the portable cold foam blender, it's one of the fastest rollouts in our history in terms of how it's reached all our stores.So when we have them ready, when we do the renovations, when we have new stores built in automatically, they are actually getting the Siren System. And I feel very good about the way we are managing the portfolio of investments that we are making in this area.OperatorYour next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.David E. TarantinoI have a follow-up question on the commentary related to the longer-term targets. I know we're going to get more details in November on this. But I think the comments were that you have multiple paths to deliver both the revenue and the earnings targets. And I wanted to focus in on the revenue part of that.I guess if you continue to grow at the rate you're growing from a unit growth perspective, I think you would need to maintain that comp outlook that you gave previously to get to the revenue guidance, unless I'm missing something. So I guess the question is, are you signaling that maybe the unit growth element could change and the comp element could change and you could still get there? I guess maybe any clarification on that front would be helpful.Laxman NarasimhanGreat. Let me take this point on the top line. First of all, Starbucks is an iconic brand with a very strong appeal and durability. If we just look in the last year, the affinity of our brand has strengthened, right? The brand has ranged across consumer segments, across geographies, across occasions. So to your question on top line, we have a historically high number of customers who visit our stores. But it's also in many of the markets around the world, even as China recovers.We have a strong pipeline of innovation across beverage, across food and equipment, and there are even more opportunities across the world with perhaps a different formats, as I mentioned earlier, with dayparts and a focus on dayparts and how we can bring more innovation, particularly on the daypart side, and with new business models like delivery. We built this billion-dollar leg, and it's only now beginning operationally refocused on that and saying how do we ensure that we continue to support that kind of delivery with an operating model that would actually help.I mentioned earlier that we have terrific capabilities in digital as well as in artificial intelligence and machine learning that we're just unleashing with even more agility in terms of how we strengthen and scale with digital. And it's not just our stores, but it's also in the Connect stores, and it's at Starbucks digital solutions across the world. We have strength in pricing capabilities. And as we make these investments, we're going to get even better in terms of revenue management, building on the great work that's already been done in terms of managing mix, in terms of managing sizing and in managing customization.We have a lobby that is further opportunity for us in terms of how we grow. So I think just in terms of that, there's real opportunity. And in terms of net store growth, as I mentioned earlier, we do have even more headroom in new store builds, both in the U.S. as well as internationally. Our China number is the milestone to even get greater penetration. And some of the opportunities we see and the unit economics that we see in Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa is real.And we have a range of formats where we can deliver this third place experience, but also deliver experiential convenience powered by digital in an omnichannel way. So I look at its brand, I look at its consumer appeal, I look at its durability, I look at its strength, I look at its range, it feels very good to me that we will get to a revenue growth of 10% to 12%, and by the way, the earnings growth of 15% to 20% over time.OperatorYour next question comes from Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo.Zachary Robert FademSo following up on the long-term algo. If your comps were to slow to a mid-single-digit level for whatever reason, would you say that your 15% to 20% EPS is still on the table? And if so, could you talk about what margin and other levers that keep you confident?Laxman NarasimhanSo thank you for your question. As I said earlier, we see significant margin improvement opportunities at work that will come to productivity. We'll set the appropriate details of this at a later point. But I can just tell you this, as I look at the investments we're making in store, but importantly, what we see about the store, we have opportunities. So I feel very good about the 15% to 20% earnings growth.OperatorThat was our last question. I will now turn the call over to Laxman Narasimhan for closing remarks.Laxman NarasimhanThank you all for joining us on this third quarter 2023 earnings call. I deeply appreciate it, and I look forward to seeing you all in November. Until then, thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great evening.]"

But many of those bellwethers have stopped short of raising their China outlook, wary of lackluster economic figures.Consumer goods firms such as Procter &amp; Gamble, L'Oreal and Coca-Cola have taken a cautious stance.""What we're seeing is a very cautious consumer in China, a declining property market and reduced export demand,"" Unilever finance chief Graeme Pitkethly told an April-June earnings call last week.""There is high unemployment in China, particularly youth unemployment ... As much as we can tell, we're at the historical low point in terms of Chinese consumer confidence.""Beijing has rolled out a series of policy measures in recent weeks to shore up the flagging economy, but weak manufacturing data for July on Tuesday shows it is still far from turning a corner.That is a particular blow for major European exporters to China, which are already struggling with persistent global price pressures and rising borrowing costs.Ireland-based Kerry Group, which supplies ingredients to companies like McDonald's, said its volumes had increased in China since COVID restrictions ended.But chief executive Edmond Scanlon cautioned on Wednesday that business would not get back to normal there until 2024.""Any (stimulus) announcements out of China are more likely to put a floor under growth rather than restimulate growth,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager at Natixis in Boston. ""It’s not overly surprising that you’re starting to see some of that filter into the earnings backdrop.""Story continuesGlobal automakers are having to contend with increased competition from rivals in China, which for the first time took a more than 50% share of the Chinese market in the first half of 2023.

Earnings recovery in the world's biggest auto market is likely to take time, he said.Expectations for second-quarter earnings are already low due in part to China's weakness. Refinitiv I/B/E/S data show U.S. and European companies are expected to report their worst quarterly results in years.The short-lived bounce in economic activity after China lifted its long COVID lockdowns also highlights poor global demand, DHL Group, one of the world's biggest shippers, said on Tuesday.The company saw drops of 16% and 7.1% respectively in air and ocean freight volumes in the first half, particularly on routes between China and its two biggest trading partners, the United States and Europe.FALLING SHORTChipmakers such as Samsung and SK Hynix said China's reopening had failed to spark a revival in the smartphone market, and that they were extending production cuts of NAND memory chips used in handsets to store data.Even Apple, the world's most valuable company, is likely to post flat iPhone sales in its third-largest market when it reports results Thursday. Still, that would be an improvement from the 2.1% contraction researcher IDC estimated for China's overall smartphone market in April-June.Top miners and heavy machinery makers have also taken a hit from a prolonged property sector slump.""We expected sales in China to be below the typical 5% to 10% of our enterprise sales.

Elsewhere, semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices predicts that the planned launch of its new artificial intelligence chips will drive earnings higher this year, while Starbucks sees demand for its coffee and food offerings slow in North America.1. Fitch downgrades U.S. credit ratingFitch has lowered its rating of U.S. debt to AA+ from the top tier level of AAA, citing concerns over a rising debt burden and eroding confidence in Washington's leadership, only months after lawmakers brought the world's largest economy to the brink of a sovereign default.The downgrade, which is the first by a major ratings agency in over a decade, points to fears that repeated political standoffs over the debt limit could threaten the stability of the $25 trillion global Treasury market. Treasuries have typically been seen as a safe-haven asset backed by trust that America will pay back its obligations, and this faith has helped to underpin U.S. debt as a benchmark for stocks and other bonds.While Fitch's move is not expected to immediately alter this role, it does raise some questions around America's reputation for reliability. In a statement on Tuesday, the ratings firm argued that there has been ""a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters.""Fitch also predicted that the general government deficit will climb to 6.3% of gross domestic product in 2023, up from 3.7% in 2022, ""reflecting weaker federal revenues, new spending initiatives and a higher interest burden.""The announcement was met with some derision, with economist Lawrence Summers calling it ""bizarre and inept"" in light of recent signs of U.S. economic resilience and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying it was ""arbitrary and based on outdated data.""Story continues2. Futures lower after Fitch announcementU.S. stock futures moved lower on Wednesday, while the dollar slipped and Treasury futures rose, as investors attempted to gauge the impact of Fitch's decision.By 05:18 ET (09:18 GMT), the Dow futures contract had dropped by 232 points or 0.64%, S&amp;P futures lost 39 points or 0.84%, and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 182 points or 1.15%.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, fell by 0.16% to 102.14, but remained relatively close to three-month highs. Yields on U.S. Treasuries, meanwhile, declined. Prices for these bonds typically increase when yields fall.Investors had a relatively muted reaction to the downgrade, with some analysts saying they expect the fallout to be limited. However, they flagged that it still injects added uncertainty into markets at a time when the immediate path ahead for the world economy is murky.3. AMD and StarbucksAlong with the Fitch downgrade, markets were pouring over the latest quarterly earnings from chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and coffeehouse chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).AMD forecast that the release of its artificial intelligence chips will drive up its annual results, sending shares higher in premarket trading.The semiconductor group plans to launch its MI300 AI chips later this year. The technology is expected to compete directly with rival Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the increasingly lucrative market for AI-powering chips. Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su noted that customer interest in the MI300 series of chips is ""very high.""Starbucks, meanwhile, reported global comparable sales that missed estimates, as demand for the Frappuccino maker's drinks and food showed signs of slowing in North America. Quarterly transactions in the region rose by just 1%, down from a 6% uptick in the prior three-month period.But Starbucks still topped profit estimates thanks in large part to a sharp recovery in sales in China, which analysts said helped mitigate a premarket slide in the company's shares.4. Qualcomm highlights earnings dayThis week's wave of quarterly corporate earnings gathers pace Wednesday, with chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) set to headline the slate of companies reporting.The San Diego-based group, which makes chips that help power a wide range of smartphones, is expected to deliver fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.81 on adjusted revenue of $8.51 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. In the corresponding period last year, the company posted an EPS of $2.96 and revenues of $10.93B.Analysts at JPMorgan said earlier this week that Qualcomm could beat relatively low estimates, citing recent returns from its rivals that suggest ""improved trends"" in the sluggish smartphone market.Demand for handset devices has faced headwinds as inflation-hit consumers rein in spending on non-essential items, replacement cycles elongate, and smartphone makers struggle to come up with new advances to entice customers. In the first quarter, global smartphone shipments slipped by 13%, according to research firm Canalys.Elsewhere, other firms posting results include pharmacy chain CVS (NYSE:CVS), fintech group PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), and fast food corporation Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM).5. Crude prices climb after U.S. inventories drawOil prices rose Wednesday, nearing their highest levels since April, after industry data pointed to a hefty fall in U.S. inventories, indicating robust demand from the world's biggest fuel consumer.Data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday showed that U.S. crude inventories shrank by 15.4 million barrels in the week to July 28, the largest draw seen in data stretching back to 1982. Official data from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session for confirmation.Outside of the U.S., Saudi Arabia is expected to announce that it will extend its voluntary output cuts into September at an OPEC+ meeting on Friday, Reuters has reported.By 05:19 ET, the U.S. crude contract traded 0.98% higher at $82.17 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.86% to $85.64.Related ArticlesFitch downgrades U.S. credit rating, AMD's AI chip plans - what's moving marketsFitch cuts US credit rating to AA+; Treasury calls it 'arbitrary'Marketmind: Triple-A headache]"

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Hourican.Story continuesKevin P. HouricanThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I would like to cover 3 topics during my section of our call. First, I'll provide a summary of our Q4 results and our full year performance. Second, I'll convey an update on our Recipe for Growth strategy. And lastly, I'll provide some commentary on the macro conditions which we have modeled for fiscal '24 and how Sysco intends to operate within that environment. Kenny will provide much more detailed components of guidance during his section. So let's get started. We are pleased with the strong finish to the fiscal year. Sysco posted record top line and bottom line results during the fourth quarter. Top line results as seen on Slide 5, were up 4.1% compared to last year, delivering $19.7 billion in sales. The strong quarter generated a full year sales result of $76.3 billion, a record at Sysco. We grew annual sales by 12.5% or $8.6 billion on a constant currency basis. That sales growth is the equivalent of creating a net new Fortune 500 company within Sysco. Turning to volumes. Q4 case volume grew 2.3% and local case volume grew 0.8% across our U.S. Foodservice business, successfully growing our market share and furthering our #1 position in food service distribution. We are pleased with our share gains for the quarter and the year which build on meaningful gains delivered within fiscal year '22. Importantly, these gains are profitable share gains. We are not growing for the sake of growing as we have consistently pursued profitable sales growth vectors domestically and internationally. Moving to gross profit. Our sales and merchandising teams delivered a strong quarter from a GP growth perspective. We grew gross margin rates and GP dollars per case, which is not easy to do in a disinflationary environment. Our teams are doing excellent work in strategic sourcing to reduce COGS and further penetrating Sysco brand cases with our customers. Advancing Sysco brand helps gross profit and leads to increased customer retention. Lastly, we are growing our higher margin specialty business, which strengthens our overall margin profile. Next in the P&amp;L is operating expense. I am most proud of the quarter from the perspective of the progress that we are making in reducing our expenses. We have been clear with investors that our first half of the year in fiscal '23 had elevated expenses. This was driven by 2 factors: investments in our business and a supply chain struggling with new colleague productivity. In the second half of fiscal '23, we made major progress on our expense ratios in greatly accelerated productivity improvement within our supply chain. Retention of colleagues has improved, productivity of our colleagues has improved, and our supply chain initiatives are bearing fruit. All told, we delivered an operating leverage of 370 basis points in Q4, growing GP dollars meaningfully more than expenses. Slide 7 highlights the sequential improvement with OpEx over the course of the last fiscal year. We began the year in our U.S. Foodservice segment with quarterly operating expense growing over 22%, but ended the year with a growth rate of 0.5%. Our focused effort to deliver supply chain efficiencies and broad-based cost reductions drove the sequential improvement across the year. We expect to make further operating expense progress in 2024. We will be [zealot-like] on ensuring our supply chain is properly staffed, properly trained and working safely and productively. We have the leadership expertise, supply chain tools and supply chain infrastructure to lead the industry in this regard, which is 1 reason why Sysco operates at an EBIT margin over 1.5x higher than our industry distributor average. Record top line and record bottom line performance in Q4 is a direct result of our Recipe for Growth and our focus on excellence in execution and operations. The improvement from first half to second half within fiscal '23 was notable, enabling Sysco to grow EPS more than 23% for the full year. In addition to delivering a strong P&amp;L in Q4, we achieved record free cash flow, and we returned approximately $1.5 billion back to shareholders during the year. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the quarter despite rapid disinflation and slower overall industry market volume growth. We believe our success in spite of those conditions, positions the business to be successful in 2024, which I will speak to more in a moment. As is my custom, I would like to provide a brief summary of select Recipe for Growth elements of our strategy from our recent quarter. I will start within our supply chain initiative. Our work on strengthening engineered labor standards across our supply chain is paying dividends. As I mentioned a moment ago, we made significant headway in improving our supply chain efficiency. We have recently strengthened our work method standards training within transportation roles, enabling our colleagues to work safely and work more productively. Additionally, we have increased retention rates within our workforce through our improved training programs. The driver academy is national, and the impact of this program is a better trained workforce. Now I would like to highlight the progress that we have made on the food sales and marketing side of our Recipe for Growth. Last month, we announced an agreement to purchase BIX Produce. BIX Produce is a leading produce specialty distributor based in Minnesota. The acquisition is expected to provide a strategic opportunity for FreshPoint to expand its geographic footprint in an area of the country where it does not currently have operations. BIX has a strong assortment offering, including fresh-cut produce, grab-and-go sandwiches, and value-added production capabilities. In addition to our good work in expanding specialty, we also upgraded our digital shopping platform during the quarter. Our Shop digital platform is now available in Spanish and we have deployed more than 100 new feature enhancements. Some of these enhancements include a new homepage, new category and cuisine pages, improved search and navigation and lastly, a new Deals For You page. These enhancements have driven an increase in product page visits, adding incremental volume through add to cart purchasing. There is no finish line in our digital improvement journey. We will continue to improve our digital tools over time, enabling us to reduce friction in the purchase experience and inspire our customers to buy more from Sysco. Our centralized pricing tool has given us the ability to be what we call right on price at the region, customer and item level. During the first half of '23, we experienced rapid inflation and in the second half of '23, we experienced rapid disinflation and even deflation towards the end of Q4 within our core USBL business. Our merchants have been biting to secure best possible cost and our pricing tool ensures that the real-time cost fluctuations are built into our pricing strategies. Managing pricing across hundreds of thousands of customers, tens of thousands of products, and approximately 7,500 sales reps has never been stronger. This is evidenced by our consistently strong performance in GP dollars growth and adjusted gross margin rate growth of 28 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. We want our sales reps focused on customer engagement, relationship building, consultative selling, and solving problems for our customers. Our pricing tool enables our SPs to spend more time on those value-added activities. Lastly, Sysco Your Way is now live in over 400 neighborhoods across 5 countries and our loyalty program, Perks is active with over 12,000 customers. Both programs are continuing to deliver compelling top and bottom line growth. The past year has been a heavy lift as we work to get these programs off the ground. In 2024, we can focus on maximizing the impact of these compelling programs with less effort and investment required than in 2023. In summary, our Recipe for Growth is working, enabling Sysco to profitably grow our business and differentiate versus others in our space. Most Compelling is that food away-from-home is a growth sector as seen on Slides 10 and 11. Sysco has been profitably growing faster than the overall market, delivering record top and bottom line results. We expect to continue to win market share profitably in the years to come, introduce so in a fiscally responsible way. I'd like to wrap up my time this morning with some comments about the operating environment we expect for fiscal '24 and Sysco's positioning within that environment. My main message is that scale matters in this industry and that strong operators are best positioned to succeed regardless of the environmental conditions. Sysco is a very strong operator with meaningful scale advantages. With that said, in fiscal '24, we expect the market to grow at a lower rate than '23. We also expect the rate of inflation for the year to be below historical standards. In the second half of fiscal '23, we experienced rapid disinflation, followed by deflation within our core U.S. Broadline business towards the end of the fourth quarter. We expect that deflation will continue within U.S. Broadline for the first half of fiscal '24, followed by muted U.S. Broadline product inflation in the second half. We expect that our International segment will remain inflationary during the coming fiscal year given unique marketplace conditions in those geographies. Net-net, for Sysco, we expect an inflation rate that is slightly positive throughout fiscal 2024 below our historical average. We believe the Q4 environment, we just exited is largely reflective of the operating environment for the coming year. Importantly, we grew our top and bottom line within that quarter. We are being very prudent in fiscal '24 in managing our expenses given the volume and inflation components that I just conveyed. Despite these conditions, Sysco is positioned to succeed, grow faster than the market and deliver bottom line growth. Our confidence is also based on our structural competitive advantages. First, our International business, which is approximately 18% of sales, continues to outperform, providing a natural hedge as international inflation rates remain elevated and are expected to stay higher than the U.S. Second, our purchasing scale is the largest in the industry, and our strategic sourcing efforts will enable Sysco to secure improved pricing in a deflationary environment. Third, Sysco, as a diversified business with strong sales across 12 major product categories to help buffer the impact of inflation or deflation in any 1 category. Additionally, our strategic pricing software will enable Sysco to be extremely purposeful on how we manage the impact of disinflation and deflation. Lastly, further advancing Sysco brand penetration, domestically and internationally, is another lever to pull to deliver GP dollar growth when the environment is deflationary. The exit velocity of fiscal '23 gives us confidence in delivering strong results in 2024. In summary, here is what we expect for '24. Lower rates of overall market volume growth versus '23, continued market share gains and profitable growth at Sysco, deflation in the U.S. for at least the first half of the year and muted overall company-wide inflation for the full year. Disciplined expense management. Kenny and I have directed an effort to reduce structural expenses by approximately $100 million. Extremely disciplined return on invested capital or ROIC focus, continued progress in advancing Sysco brand penetration and growth within specialty. In total, given all these interworking variables, we are modeling an adjusted EPS range of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full year. The midpoint of that guide would generate approximately 7% EPS growth versus fiscal '23. Now in our third year of Recipe for Growth, we are positioned to press the accelerator on certain proven initiatives. For example, we can optimize our performance and launch Sysco Your Way neighborhoods, which takes less effort than starting up a neighborhood. Our digital tools are becoming more and more pervasive with our customers, and we can optimize the personalization of these interactions to increase yield through each transaction. We have always said that the Recipe for Growth is a wheel where each initiative fuels the next. Fiscal '24 is a year of optimizing what we have launched versus kicking off net new efforts. This will enable Sysco to be laser-focused on what matters most, executing with excellence against launched programs. This also means we will be able to grow our business with less investment. This was always our plan within the Recipe for Growth, and it is coming to reality in fiscal '24. In addition, our expanded geography of specialty businesses, like the recently announced BIX acquisition will increase the impact of our higher growth in specialty segment. In fiscal '24, we are committed to both profitably growing our top line, meaningfully reducing OpEx and generating a higher rate of return on key initiatives. Given the confidence that we have in our long-range road map, we are happy to announce that we have reintroduced ROIC as a long-term compensation metric for our leadership team. In addition, we have increased the weighting of financial metrics within our short-term annual bonus program. As I have said many times before, the best companies in the world are growth companies, and we expect that Sysco will continue to profitably grow faster than the overall market. I'm thrilled to have Kenny as my partner on these objectives. We are committed to maximizing every dollar invested in producing the greatest shareholder value. I'll now turn it over to Kenny, who will provide additional financial details. Kenny, over to you.Kenny K. CheungThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start off by thanking our customers, colleagues and partners around the world for helping us deliver another record quarter. Sysco operates a high-volume business and I'm proud of our efficient response in servicing and delighting our customers. We closed out the fiscal year strong, delivering improvement across the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. Q4 financials reflect positive sales and volume growth and operating expense leverage. Altogether, these rendered a record quarter of operating income, net income and adjusted EPS. Our results also reflect improvements in operational efficiency through productivity and resource optimization. This elevated performance will enable us to reinvest back into the business and return excess cash back to shareholders, an important theme we expect for FY '24 and beyond. Our unique value proposition with the Recipe for Growth at the forefront is what differentiates us as a growth company. As Kevin stated earlier, we will continue to focus on accelerating programs that have high returns, which is a key priority in my role here at Sysco. Now turning to a summary of the reported results for the quarter, starting on Slide 14. For the fourth quarter, our enterprise sales grew 4.1% in with U.S. Foodservice growing 2.5%, International growing 12.2% and SYGMA growing 1.4%. With respect to volume, Total U.S. Foodservice volume increased 2.3% and local volume increased 0.8%. We produced $3.7 billion in gross profit up 7% versus prior year. Adjusted gross margin improved to 18.7%, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and an increase of 28 bps compared to last year. Our gross profit dollar and margin percentage improvement during the fourth quarter reflected our ability to continue to effectively manage product inflation, which moderated to 2.1% for the total enterprise consistent with our expectations. The improvement in gross profit was driven by incremental progress from our strategic sourcing efforts as well as improved penetration rates from Sysco brand's products which increased by 11 bps to 37.2% in U.S. Broadline and 64 bps to 47.3% in U.S. local results. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were $2.7 billion for the quarter or 13.5% of sales, a 29 bps improvement from the prior year. All 4 operating segments continue to show increases in quarterly profitability, including substantial growth in the International and SYGMA segments. As seen on Slide 22 and 23, Q4 adjusted operating income of $1 billion for the enterprise showed a strong exit rate, growing 25% compared to FY '19. This is the highest adjusted operating income quarter in Sysco's history and is now the fourth consecutive period of record quarterly operating income. For the year, adjusted operating income increased to $3.2 billion, growing 17.3% compared to our prior FY '19 record, an important signal of the progress being made at Sysco. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $1.2 billion, growing 14.4%. We are thrilled with the progress of our International segment with adjusted operating income growing 58% for the fourth quarter. As stated earlier, our International business continues to deliver robust growth with positive momentum. I am also particularly pleased with the health of our balance sheet, which further strengthened this quarter. We delivered on our target leverage ratio, another important milestone as we ended the year at 2.5x net debt leverage ratio. This is within our target of 2.5x to 2.75x, a substantial improvement from 5.1x just over 2 years ago. We ended the year with $9.7 billion in net debt with total liquidity of $3.7 billion and no commercial paper outstanding. Our debt is well laddered without any maturities over $1 billion until FY '27. Turning to our cash flow. We generated $2.9 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow, which was a new record. Our conversion rate from adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow was 55% and operating cash flow conversion of 75% shows the company's robust earnings power. Our strong financial position enabled us to return $1.5 billion to shareholders. This was done through $500 million of share repurchases and $996 million of dividends. Despite the changing macroeconomic landscape, we are positioned to grow both top line and bottom line results in FY '24 and the long term. The guidance we are providing is reflective of the traction, our Recipe for Growth initiatives are gaining in addition to moderate industry growth rates. Furthermore, we believe our Q4 performance provides significant proof of our ability to drive shareholder value as several of these macroeconomic and industry dynamics are expected to continue into FY '24. As Kevin highlighted on Slide 7, we began the year with elevated levels of operating expense growth. As a result, operating expenses were an area of focus for our supply chain teams throughout the year, and we were able to produce sequential improvements. We ended the year with significant operating expense leverage, allowing us to improve margins. This is important progress, and we expect continued improvement going into FY '24. Let's now turn to look forward. During FY '24, a we expect top line growth of mid-single digits and positive volume growth, which will move Sysco to approximately $80 billion in annual sales. This will be another record for Sysco. Importantly, we expect inflation to be slightly positive on an enterprise basis for the full year. Based on our analysis and the exit rate from the fourth quarter, we believe that first half globally will be slightly positive and the second half will step up. This includes continued deflation in U.S. Broadline during the first half of the fiscal year with an expected rebound in the second half of the fiscal year. Based on our structural advantages, Sysco is well positioned to manage our COGS effectively and continue to pass along pricing without impacting demand. It is all about better buying and better selling. Turning to expenses. We expect further improvements in operating expense leverage based on a continuation of the process improvement from this past year. One month into the new year, we've already executed actions to support $100 million of cost out where it has been factored into the guidance. We will continue finding incremental opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and adapt swiftly to the constant evolving business environment in which we function. We will manage our business with discipline and agility. We have bottled out frontline operations wage growth to be approximately 4.5% to 5%. This is higher than our historical average but much lower than select other industry news due to the fact that in many instances, our supply chain colleagues are paid above market and our drivers can earn as much as $100,000 per year. We also expect free cash flow to grow further in FY '24 on top of a record performance in FY '23. We wanted to also provide guidance on several other important modeling elements. The tax rate for FY '24 is expected to step up to approximately 24.5% compared to 23% in FY '23. The increase is driven by geographical-mix related to strong international growth and increases in state tax rates. We plan to remain in line with our net debt leverage ratio for the year, related interest expense is expected to step up by about $13 million for the year due to cash uses for growth investments, dividend payments, share repurchases and anticipated M&amp;A activity. Other expenses is expected to be approximately $30 million for the year, driven primarily by pension expense. All in, we are guiding to adjusted EPS for FY '24 and at $4.20 to $4.40. This reflects adjusted EPS growth of approximately 5% to 10%. Our capital allocation strategy will continue to focus on investing in the business. Examples include M&amp;A, maintaining our strong investment-grade credit rating and continuing our return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. CapEx should be consistent with the prior year at approximately 1% of sales. Returning cash back to shareholders is important, as is our dividend aristocrat status. And we plan to step up these efforts in the coming year. In FY '24, we will have a $0.04 dividend increase, and we expect to complete approximately $750 million of share repurchases as we start the fiscal year with $4 billion in remaining authorization. Depending on the volume of M&amp;A done in FY '24, we could increase share repurchases further while continuing to operate within our stated goal of 2.5x to 2.75x leverage. We will look at each investment through the lens of driving growth and ROIC, and I am pleased to state that our ROIC for FY '24 is expected to surpass our pre-COVID levels through sales growth, margin expansion and prudent management of the balance sheet. As a company, ROIC will dynamically guide our operating and investment decisions which will accrete shareholder value over time as we continue to focus on both margin dollars and percentage growth. Now in my role for a few months, I'm constantly impressed by the size and scale advantages at Sysco. This is a high-volume business that runs fast, and any micro adjustments around operational efficiencies are felt quickly. Our scale advantages are also reflected in our industry-leading margins. Our diversification as the industry leader across customer types with 2/3 in restaurants and 1/3 in recession-resistant category, such as education and health care is also a structural advantage. Our robust industry-leading operating cash flow and strong investment-grade rated balance sheet, gives us access to capital at attractive rates. So we're able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. As you can see in our performance results, our International segment is proving to be an advantage, contributing higher rates of growth than our mature U.S. business and the inflation dynamics in other geographies are helping create a bit of a natural hedge across our business portfolio. We believe that International continues to be a profitable growth engine for Sysco. I am even more excited 90 days into this role than I was on day 1, and I look forward to our progress ahead. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kevin for closing remarks.Kevin P. HouricanThank you, Kenny. As we conclude, I would like to provide a brief summary on Slide 28. Sysco has a strong record of generating consistent results. In fact, Sysco has grown annual sales in 51 years out of our 54-year history. We expect our positive momentum to continue in 2024. In addition to compelling top line growth, Sysco is the industry leader from an adjusted EBITDA margin perspective with the strongest balance sheet. We plan to build on that position of strength in fiscal year 2024. We ended our fiscal year 2023 with strong sales volume and share growth, growing volumes across both our chain and independent business. The result was a 23% adjusted EPS growth for the year with record top and bottom line contribution. We have momentum going into the year as our Recipe for Growth transformation now in its third year is further building upon and enhancing our competitive scale advantages. Importantly, we have demonstrated our third consecutive quarter of operating leverage with gross profits outpacing operating expense growth. For fiscal year '24, our dual focus on core efficiency measures and optimization from proven growth opportunities will deliver another year of top and bottom line growth. There are bright days ahead for the food away-from-home industry and more specifically, Sysco. I am both excited and proud to be a part of the journey and as always, I want to thank our 72,000-plus Sysco colleagues for their commitment to our customers and our shareholders. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Edward Kelly at Wells Fargo.Edward Joseph KellyKevin, so my question is on the guidance. I mean, obviously, the backdrop for the industry is a little bit tougher than what it would normally be. And providing guidance in that backdrop is not easy, 5% to 10% earnings growth against that is certainly respectable. But can you talk about the confidence in that level of growth, the cadence that we could be expecting? And if you were to be at the bottom end of the range or worse, what would drive that? And if you are at the top -- the better end of the range, what would cause that outcome?Kevin P. HouricanEd, this is Kevin. I'll start, and I'll toss to Kenny for additional comments. I guess I'd start with a few points. The guide is based on the continuation of momentum that the company has been building over the past 6 months, most notably tied to our operating expense improvements. We call our planning process 3 big boulders: volume of the market, inflation projections of the market, and then our expense ratios. And we worked very hard to make sure that we can do the best job possible in guiding what these individual 3 components will be. So let's start with volume. As I said in my prepared remarks, we do expect for the volume growth of the industry to be more muted this coming year. We have factored that in to our guide. We've triangulated that from supplier partners, from economists, from bankers and our own data. We have a treasure trove of data across all of the different business segments that we serve. So we do expect for volume growth of the market to be more muted. With that said, we're confident that we -- Sysco can grow faster than the market, and we are committed to doing so profitably. Topic 2 is inflation or deflation as it is, as it were. And we have to break that down into individual businesses in individual countries. As I said in my prepared remarks, USBL we expect to be deflationary for at least the first half of the year. We do have a natural hedge at Sysco, given the fact that we have an International segment that is still experiencing inflation due to unique geography considerations and purchasing considerations within those countries. So when you put that all together for the year, I'll use that same term a second time, we expect for muted inflation for the entire year that's below our historical standards. On the positive side, continued logistics efficiency. A chart on our slide, that we're really pleased with is Page 7 in our slides that are out there. The progress that was sequentially made throughout the year from quarter-over-quarter on improving our logistics efficiency, we expect to continue. There's some important below-the-line things in the guide that Kenny can talk to about tax and interest. To answer your question on confidence that I'll end with Q4, the environment that we've just exited and most notably June, we believe to be reasonably consistent with what we expect the overall environmental conditions to be in fiscal '24, and we had a solid performance, ending the year in a solid performance in June. So when I put all those things together, that's why the guide -- what would have to be true to be at the top end, continued performance on operating cost efficiency improvement, accelerate our growth versus the market. Those would be the 2 things directly within our control that could enable us to be at the top. For us to be at the bottom end of that range would be, I'd say, if deflation lasted longer or persisted longer or were deeper than had been modeled that would be a headwind that would put it more towards the bottom end of the range. So we focus on what we can control at Sysco. We're going to drive operating efficiency. Kenny and I, as announced today, have issued $100 million cost-out improvement, which is baked into the guidance that we just provided, and we've actually executed already against the major components of that plan. And we've got our sales teams focused on driving profitable sales growth. With that, I'm going to toss to Kenny for any additional comment.Kenny K. CheungThank you, Kevin. I'll talk about 2 things. One, the confidence level around the guidance. And second, as Kevin alluded to, a couple of below-the-line items, I think needs a bit more color. The first is around the confidence in the guidance. Our confidence in the guidance is based on how we successfully managed Q4. So if you think about Q4, we ended the quarter inflationary in the U.S. And with that, we still managed to expand GP margins by 28 bps and operating margin by 56 bps. So again, we're doing it right now. The second piece I would say is that if the environment were to change, we have the agility to flex up and down, given the fact that we have a world-class balance sheet, and we have a very agile cost structure, and we have productivity in place, a $100 million that has already been executed and baked in, in our guidance. So that is around the confidence of the guidance. In terms of the below-the-line items, there are 2 areas I want to go a bit deeper on. One is tax rates. We expect our tax rate to step up from 23% to 24.5%. There's 2 pieces to the tax side: First, we are seeing earnings strengthening across our International markets, which is yielding a higher tax charge. This is a good thing. We are seeing our International arm growing fast. The second piece is here in the U.S., we are expecting a higher state tax expense due to various factors, including the mix of earnings across the state. This is our current view. We are continuing to evaluate tax planning strategies, and we'll report back as appropriate. The second piece is around interest expense. Overall, the rate has risen, and we also plan to raise capital to deploy against high-returning accretive initiatives, which includes growth investments, M&amp;A, return excess cash to shareholders, this is driving the higher interest expense, again, $13 million increase year-over-year. The last bucket is other expenses. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect it to be roughly $30 million related to pension expense.OperatorYour next question will come from Joshua Long at Stephens Inc.Joshua C. LongHopefully, you might be able to dig into some of the underlying core customer segments. Obviously, we were able to see some of the case volume trends there that you provided in the release, and that's helpful. And just curious if you could tie that together, Kevin with some of your high-level thoughts on where the consumers at, how they're choosing to spend their dollars and maybe how that corresponds with your customer makeup as we think about the fiscal '24 guide?Kevin P. HouricanYes, Joshua, thank you for the question. I'll start just at the more aggregate level. As you know, we serve every segment of the food away-from-home industry, which is what I meant -- or answered to Ed's question about we have a treasure trove of data, we can see macro trends. So our national sales team had a banner year this past year. That's on top of a banner year in 2022. I want to be very clear that those growth -- those growth constructs are profitable growth. So that's health care, education, travel and hospitality business and industry, those sectors have been continuing to see a tailwind of recovery, and we're winning market share profitably in those sectors. National restaurants. We are winning large in that regard as well, mostly because those partners view Sysco as a backbone for them. We're in every state, including Alaska and Hawaii, not every food distributor is, and it's an easy button for them to be able to partner with someone like Sysco because we can distribute coast-to-coast. And many of these restaurants have international doors into our International Freight Group business, we can export their product overseas to usually a licensee partner that they use in those countries. So again, for these national restaurant chains we are a very attractive option for them, and we've been winning big. Those contracts are multiyear contracts. And as I've mentioned, we've been signing those contracts at above historical profit margin rates. On the local side, we've been winning in specialty. As I mentioned, the BIX Produce acquisition intent today that will be a tailwind for us in fiscal '24. We're winning with our Italian segment, and we're winning market share in aggregate as a company. So when I think about the end consumer, the rapid rate of inflation increased this past year put a strain on the American consumer. Specifically, beef at one point was 35-plus percent inflationary. You saw a portion of sizes being reduced at menus. You saw menu price increases. And I do think that had an impact on particularly the independent sector. And as I think about the future, the deflation that we're currently experiencing and the return to eventually, what we would say would be normal rates of inflation, which are 2% to 3%, will be good for the end consumer. So when I talk about our teams internally, think about a graph chart where inflation was well above healthy. Now we're dealing with disinflation into deflation. And now that curve is going to come back to normal over the next period of time. And as we're thinking about fiscal '25, you would see more normal rates of inflation, and that should drive a tailwind in volume, and those 2 things together for 2025 would be favorable elements for Sysco. So how are we thinking about this to help our customers? As Kenny said, well, we're going to work our tails off to have best possible purchasing economics so that we can share in value with our consumers, things like discounts on appetizers. So that, in fact, that can be added to the purchase. Because when that center of plate cost goes up, what we tend to see is dessert and app purchases go down, and we want to help our end consumers and customers be successful by providing them with strong and compelling value through Sysco.Joshua C. LongThat's helpful. And then 1 follow-up, if I could. When we think about the $100 million in cost out that comes on the heels of some other great work over the last year or 2 coming out of COVID. Curious if you could dimensionalize that $100 million a little bit more and maybe not getting into the specifics of it, but just the visibility you have into maybe the timing or the realization of those? Is that relatively balanced across the year? Do you have -- do we think about this in terms of just maybe second or third round iterations of initiatives that you've had more experience with in the past and just as you have more time, you found new wins there, are these entirely new categories? Just any additional commentary you could provide there as we think about the ability to drive margins and pull costs out of the system would be very helpful.Kenny K. CheungThanks, Josh. This is Kenny. I'll take a couple of things, and I'll go a bit more detail. So for us, it's all about driving operating leverage in our business. And what does that mean? That means our GP growth will be faster than expense growth. Our EBITDA will be faster than sales, operating leverage in our business. As it relates to the $100 million, to your question directly, yes, it will be more balanced across the year. And why is that? Because we've started already, right? It started on day 1. So we -- all the actions have already been executing, meaning it's already baked into our guidance and all actions are underway. That's point number one. Point number two, this is incremental to the continued productivity gains and supply chain operations and efficiency that Kevin described earlier. The last thing I would say is that we're not stopping, right? We will continue to flex in line with market conditions. Now I know you asked for a bit more detail. Let me give you a tangible example. There are multiple parts to $100 million. But let me give you an example. We've been able to expand our Global [share] Support Center, GSC, into other markets, most recently in Costa Rica. I was there about a month ago, where we have access to great talent and to further build our scale advantage. So as our business grows, we're able to leverage a platform that scales accretively and effectively for earnings.OperatorYour next question will come from John Heinbockel at Guggenheim Securities.John Edward HeinbockelSo Kevin, 2 topics. I'll hit them both upfront. So number one, maybe update on wallet share, right? You talked about that in the past. Where is that opportunity today? And obviously, if you drive drop size, right, and that's the most efficient thing you can do. So where is that? And then two, I think you overtime is down to 0. So volumes were a little lighter. What lever do you now pull on, right? Because I don't think you guys want to -- you don't want to furlough folks, where do you go next if overtime is at 0?Kevin P. HouricanYes. Thanks, John. I'll do the second question first and then your first question second. I want to be crystal clear on what we meant by overtime at 0. It's excess overtime, was taken to 0. So the industry runs at a -- let's call it, an average rate of overtime because some overtime is good. Our employees desire some amount of overtime, a truck that leaves the warehouse and doesn't get back for 12 hours because that's the nature of the route. There's going to be some overtime, et cetera. So what we meant by that is that excess over time and during the worst of the supply chain disruption, we had meaningful, meaningful excess overtime. So we feel really good about that. Where can additional efficiencies come from? Retention improvement, John. So our turnover has dramatically improved, and it can still further improve to get back to historical levels of retention. And if you asked me 6 months ago, what's the single most important thing that we need to do more effectively, it was improved retention because that flows through in many different ways, lower hiring costs, lower training costs, higher productivity because a 2-year veteran is much more productive than a 2-day newbie. They're also a safer, fewer accidents occur because they're trained and know how to do their job. So retention improvement would be the #1 lever. But the second lever is just improving discipline to what we call Sysco's work standards. The Driver Academy, we have a Selector Academy, and our engineered labor standards keep getting better and stronger. We improve processes through leveraging technology, and that's the next wave of productivity improvement is to have better discipline to a standard work process. So we still have opportunity to improve. I'm really pleased, most particularly pleased with the improvement we made in supply chain, and we have factored continued improvement into our 2024 guidance. On the wallet share side of the business, I guess what excites me the most on our opportunity, and we're not going to quote a share of wallet percentage today. But Sysco Your Way and Perks are doing what we want and need for them to do, which is further penetrating additional categories of merchandise with existing customers. The Sysco Your Way model is through increased delivery frequency, a dedicated cells rep, a dedicated delivery driver and our consistent presence in that neighborhood 6 days a week with an afternoon recovery delivery, we are seeing what we would expect to see which is customers in those neighborhoods are adding specialty to the basket, eliminating another distributor from the purchase consideration and rolling up more with us. And Perks essentially does the same thing, but it's for a customer who happens not to be within a Sysco Your Way neighborhood. They could be 45 miles from the warehouse, but not within our current Sysco Your Way neighborhood. And by providing them with the Perks service capabilities and dedicated marketing support, we're seeing incremental purchases. Last but not least is specialty. We're doing a really good job in our SSMG, which is our meat business and our produce business. And now we have our next 10-year old specialty business with Italian. When we put those specialty businesses together, we're making a lot of progress on what we call total team selling, which is bringing that specialist into the account, along with the generalist, the SC generalist. And we're moving the needle on what we call total team selling. So it's those 3 things together, John, that are helping us with share of wallet, which as you said, is the most profitable case we can put on the [chart].OperatorYour next question will come from Kelly Bania at BMO Capital Markets.Kelly Ann BaniaI was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the centralized pricing tool and the price optimization work that you've been doing as particularly as we do transition here, it sounds like into some deflation for certain categories. And just how investors should think about modeling your gross margin as we move forward, given kind of not much disclosure at this point on how much of your business is on a percentage markup versus the dollar markup or how this centralized pricing tool can change that? And maybe included in that, can you just give us a little color on how the deflation that you're seeing right now is impacting the gross profit dollars?Kevin P. HouricanOkay, Kelly, thank you for the question. I'll start just with how we leverage the pricing tool, and then I'll toss to Kenny in regards to your questions on GP dollars and percent, and he'll handle that in whatever manner he deems appropriate. On the tool, this was what I tried to articulate during our prepared remarks. During a period of rapid inflation, it was extraordinarily helpful because we had discipline in regards to passing through what was an extraordinary increase in cost, especially in center of plate. I mean we had proteins going up 35%, as I mentioned a few moments ago. In the older manual world, it would have been unlikely that all 7,500 sales consultants would have passed that through, they would have put too much of a humanistic flare into it and said, you know what, I just know that they can't absorb this, and I'm not going to pass it through, and we would have not actually seen the GP dollars per case growth that we experienced past year. So I'm going to call it the discipline to perform within guardrails on the way up. Well, the exact same thing happens on the way down, but it's a different consideration. What I said in the prepared remarks is we will be very purposeful about when we are able to secure improved COGS, how we pass that value on to our customers. Our intention is to pass that volume on to our customers, and we need to be thoughtful, disciplined and pragmatic about how we do that. We have to be competitive with the market, and we have to understand the volatility of categories that went from 30% up to double digits down in a short period of time. So the tool provides structure and discipline and a performance within guardrails. I do want to be very clear about 1 point. It does not replace the importance of an SC in that relationship they have at that local restaurant in being what I call, again, right on price at the local level. And if we have a competitive pressure at the local level, our SCs have a process they can follow to ask for an exception and we have a RevMan team that manages and adjudicates those decisions with financial discipline. So it's a combination of 2 things. It's a tool that provides guardrails that we operate within with discipline and predictability and then we have the ability to respond at the local level through the sales force when, in fact, something unique is happening that the system can't see through data. And we're going to get better and better at that second point. We believe we can make that process faster, more agile and more efficient to give our SCs the ability to respond in the moment, and that's something that we're working on in fiscal '24. Kenny, I'll toss to you for any comments from a financial perspective.Kenny K. CheungYes. Thank you, Kevin. A couple of things I want to add, just to recap. In Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we did experience deflation rate in our U.S. market. And with that, we still expanded both GP dollars per case, GP margins as well as operating margins, both -- all 3 of them. Yes, to directly answer your question, the centralized pricing tool, it does help on the margin side. There is quite a few other levers that we have as an enterprise, right, besides pricing. So let me walk you through some of those other things that our enterprise is working on. This includes: one is strengthening our international segments, right? This obviously helps on the inflation side. They currently right now, international is close to double digit right now the spot on inflation. The second piece is strategic sourcing. Third, Sysco brand penetration, which we made immense progress this quarter. And then last is a growing specialty and the like. All these 4 things I just mentioned. In addition, to what you brought up, Kelly around pricing drives a higher earnings margin profile for our enterprise going forward.Kelly Ann BaniaAnd I guess just in terms of this lower pricing environment, do you expect your restaurant and all your customers to pass on these lower prices to consumers?Kevin P. HouricanKelly, on the national restaurant business, I would defer to the leaders of those companies to comment. I think they'll all make their own individual choices. I think at the local mom-and-pop independent level, it's an efficient market and center plate purchase costs will come down for them. And will some of them choose to lower the price point on the menu I think some will and they'll see volume benefit from that. So it's fungible to -- these things are levers that get pulled. But I'll defer to our large customer base to answer that question, especially the national chains.OperatorYour next question will come from John Ivankoe at JPMorgan.John William IvankoeThe question is on sales force compensation. I know there's been a couple of changes or enhancements in the past years, maybe 1 being in terms of new account generation, market share per account, Sysco brand product sales. I think there are a couple of different things, including, I think, most recently, the removal of some ceilings that certain sales force members are actually hitting in terms of total comp. So just wanted to get a sense of kind of what we should be focused on in '24, especially in terms of a stable comp plan? I mean how it works for both Sysco and the sales force members? And if you can make a comment in terms of the number of salespeople in the Sysco organization, does it make sense to add more? Or you give more responsibility to the best?Kevin P. HouricanYes, John, thanks for the question. I appreciate it. We are making some improvements to our compensation model this year. What John is referring to is we're actually in pilot right now with improved program. By the way, we like our current program. Our sales consultant retention is at all-time highs and we believe the program we have motivates behavior and motivates our colleagues on the right things. With that said, continuous improvement. You can always make something better and stronger. Feedback from our sales consultants has been what John just said, which is there is a cap that exists today. And people that do that type of work, don't like caps. Like, more I sell the more I should earn and the more Sysco can make. And we agreed with our sales consultants on that. So we are piloting a new structure, a new program which if they profitably grow their business, they continue to earn. And by the way, that's good for Sysco too. So it's a big company. It's a big machine. It's a big engine. As I said on my call today, it's more than 7,000 sales consultants. We need to make sure we get it right. We need to make sure it's clear, simple and understandable. And therefore, that's why we're doing a pilot. We're pleased with the results of the pilot. We're going to announce actually in August to our sales force the details of that compensation change. So with professional discretion, I'm going to choose not to comment on what it will be on this call because we haven't even told our colleagues yet. But in August, we're going to announce that worldwide sales meeting the change, it will be very well received because it's exactly what they've been asking for. And we're optimistic that, that will help us deliver the guidance that we covered today and to win more share profitably at the local level. So we're pleased with that change. We believe it will motivate even more the right behaviors, and it's good for the colleague and it's also good for Sysco, and it's good for the shareholder because it's profitable growth.OperatorYour next question will come from Alex Slagle at Jefferies.Alexander Russell SlagleI wanted to dive down a little more on the local restaurant business, and you touched on some of this with Kelly's question, but your views on the help of these independent restaurant operators, both for the Sysco customers and more broadly as you think about the traffic environment being a little bit more difficult, inflation pressures coming down, but if you're seeing any evidence of stress out there or closures or erosion in receivables, bad debt that you see on the horizon for that group of customers.Kevin P. HouricanOkay. Alex, thanks for the question. I'll start just on sentiment of that very important customer segment of ours, and then I'll toss to Kenny for any comments on receivables and bad debt. From the very beginning of COVID, I've said the following, that local mom-and-pop entrepreneur is just that they are an entrepreneur. This is their business. They're agile, they're scrappy. They're fighters, and they've dealt with a lot over the last 4 years. And this disinflation to deflation in aggregate will be a good thing for them because think about that curve I was doing, I wish we were on Zoom and you could see me, right? Like the 18% inflation followed by deflation will come back to a normalized 2% to 3% inflation once we've gotten through this transition period, and that will be good for the local operator. It would be good because it will help with volume and frankly, a little bit of margin has benefited from a little bit of inflation. So the environmental conditions are going to transition to more favorable for that local operator. As it relates to how we, Sysco, can help them, that is the core of who we are. Drive to the best possible cost for that operator through strategic sourcing, have a sales consultant who is an expert in their craft. You can help them with menu optimization, productivity improvement, Sysco brand conversion, which Kenny covered very well. We made tremendous strides in this past year or further penetrating Sysco brand. We expect for that to continue and to introduce innovation and newness to our customers through cutting-edge solution. So we believe in the independent customer. We believe there is a real reason they exist, which is people like local. They like to eat fresh and those local operators do a wonderful job of buying local product. And again, Sysco buys and sells more local produce than any other distributor despite our size. When I think about outlook for where we head from here, we have the ability to win more of those customers even if that overall customer base is going through this transition period. We serve roughly half of those independent doors, and we have a big opportunity to grow the number of doors we cover and increased share of wallet going back to John's question, with those customers. So independent customers will be a source of growth for us this coming year, which we built into our guidance. Kenny, I toss to you for any comment on AR and bad debt.Kenny K. CheungSure. Thanks, Kevin. With respect to AR and bad debt, we are not seeing any drag on working capital. If anything, it's the opposite. In fiscal year '23, we actually saw improvement in AR and AP and inventory DSO. All these few factors provided a tailwind for working capital, therefore, driving our record free cash flow and up in cash flow conversion from EBITDA.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for the question-and-answer session. So this will conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank everyone for their participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines.]"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $18.96 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Sysco shares have lost about 0.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.5%.What's Next for Sysco?While Sysco has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

Excluding items, it earned $1.34 per share, ahead of analysts' estimates of $1.33 per share.Surging inflation has begun to eat into consumers' disposable income, forcing shoppers to prioritize spending on necessities, making little room for demand for non-essential items.Even with supply chain constraints easing, Sysco is still grappling with cost pressures tied to raw materials like meat, dairy and seafood.While higher costs have pressured several companies including soda giants Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo to raise product prices, volatile and price-sensitive demand for food away from home products restricts Sysco from raising prices.The company's net sales rose to $19.73 billion in the fourth quarter ended July 1, from $18.96 billion a year ago, but still fell short of estimates of $19.99 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.(Reporting by Aatrayee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)]"

The beverage company is anticipated to have witnessed revenue and earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.87 billion, indicating growth of 12.8% from that reported in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for earnings of 39 cents per share suggests growth of 50% from the year-ago quarter’s actual. The consensus mark has moved up by a penny in the past 30 days.In the last reported quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 11.8%. However, it has delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.1%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseMonster Beverage Corporation price-eps-surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteMonster Beverage has been gaining from the continued strength in the energy drinks category and robust product innovation plans. It has been on track with price increases to wean the ongoing cost pressures. These are likely to have boosted the top and bottom-line performances in the second quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management was optimistic about the global energy drinks category. The company has been poised to gain from growth in the Monster Energy family of brands, and strength in Strategic and Affordable energy brands. Gains from these segments are likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter top line.We expect revenues for the company’s Monster Energy Drinks segment to increase 10.7% year over year in second-quarter 2023. Meanwhile, the Strategic Brands and Alcohol Brands segments are predicted to deliver sales growth of 25.1% and 15.3%, respectively.Monster Beverage has been committed to product launches and innovation to boost growth. The company has been introducing many products and expanding distribution in international markets, which have been aiding its performance.At the end of the first quarter, the company initialized the phased launch of Monster Tour Water, a pure unflavored water line in still and sparkling variants, in the United States. In EMEA, as part of an ongoing pan-EMEA launch, the company distributed Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar. It also launched Fury, its affordable energy brand, in Egypt. The company revealed plans to transition the Monster brand to the Coca-Cola distribution system in the Philippines in the second quarter. Gains from these product launches are likely to get reflected in the company’s second-quarter results.Monster Beverage has been implementing pricing actions to overcome the ongoing cost pressures. On its last reported quarter’s earnings call, it announced the implementation of additional price increases on a phased approach in the first half of 2023 in several international markets. Continued pricing actions are expected to have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage has been witnessing rising costs due to higher payroll expenses, as it is purchasing aluminum cans from local sources. MNST has been reeling under supply-chain headwinds due to the uncertain global environment.Monster Beverage has been witnessing a significant increase in the cost of sales due to elevated supply-chain costs, which has been leading to a decline in the gross profit and the gross margin rate. Additionally, the increased payroll expenses and aluminum cans’ sourcing costs have resulted in higher SG&amp;A expenses and operating costs. Our model predicts the cost of sales to increase 10.9% year over year in the second quarter, whereas operating expenses are estimated to rise 9%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Monster Beverage this time around.

HST is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug 3, after market close. While the quarterly results are likely to display year-over-year growth in revenues, funds from operations (FFO) per share might exhibit a decline.In the previous quarter, the Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a surprise of 14.58% in terms of adjusted FFO per share. The quarterly results reflected better-than-anticipated revenues, aided by continued strong leisure demand and growth in the city center markets.Over the trailing four quarters, Host Hotels’ adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average beat being 8.18%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseHost Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the second quarter, Host Hotels is likely to have capitalized on the improving lodging industry demand-supply fundamentals in the wake of the pandemic. The continued strength in the recovery of leisure travel demand has been driving the demand for HST’s well-positioned properties in markets with solid demand generators like central business districts of main cities, close to airports and in resort/conference destinations.Also, corporate demand from small and medium-sized businesses, representing a large share, is expected to have been healthy during the quarter, contributing to growth in rates.HST is expected to have witnessed occupancy growth at its properties, backed by this rebound in demand, aiding revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly RevPAR stands at $230.69, indicating an increase of 5.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $219.30. Our estimate is pegged at $229.92. The consensus mark for the average occupancy rate is pegged at 74.9%, suggesting an improvement from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure of 73.9%. We expect the average occupancy rate for the quarter to be 71.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HST’s second-quarter revenues is presently pegged at $1.42 billion, implying growth of 3.04% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.HST is likely to have continued with its acquisition and development activities during the quarter to bolster its external growth. Its capital-recycling efforts and solid balance sheet position are anticipated to have supported such activities.However, a tepid recovery in the business transient and group travel demand due to persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and high interest expenses might have impeded the company’s quarterly performance to some extent. We expect second-quarter 2023 interest expenses to rise 28.7% year over year.The company’s activities during the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to garner analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the FFO per share has been unchanged at 56 cents over the past two months. Moreover, the figure implies a year-over-year decline of 3.5%. Story continuesEarning WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Host Hotels this season.

101,aa81919c-8264-39ba-950f-6e6165a24da8,HST,2023-08-02,7 Stocks Getting a Huge Vote of Confidence From Wall Street Analysts,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-getting-huge-vote-100052985.html,1690452052,STORY,"['HST', 'META', 'BUD', 'CDE', 'HOG', 'ZS', 'BDX']","[While discrediting the acumen of experts seems to be a popular exercise on the Internet, investors can potentially gain handsomely from top analyst stocks. Of course, you’ll find some research on this topic that implies that celebrated market gurus don’t always get it right. However, it still may be worthwhile to follow stocks backed by analysts.For starters, not everyone plucked off the streets can be an analyst. Almost always, these folks have studied finance or accounting in college. If they haven’t, they certainly accrued significant real-world experience. Chances are, these experts have learned from handed-down knowledge, which offers confidence for the best Wall Street stocks.Second, targeting these analyst-endorsed high-confidence stocks enables efficiencies for the retail investor. Quite simply, the average market participant doesn’t have the time to dedicate the hours necessary to conduct deep due diligence. So, by trading with the experts, retail buyers can get some of their time back. On that note, below are the top 7 analysts’ favorite stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTop Analyst Stocks: Becton Dickinson (BDX)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA multinational medical technology firm, Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) – also known as BD – ranks among the top analyst stocks for good reason. By manufacturing and selling medical devices, instrument systems, and reagents, the business will never go out of style. Therefore, it enjoys insulation from various economic pressure points. Since the start of the year, BDX gained almost 11% of its equity value.Most recently, analysts from Piper Sandler, Stifel Nicolaus, and Raymond James pegged BDX as a buy. Among the three experts, Stifel’s Rick Wise issued the highest price target at $325, which implies nearly 15% upside potential. Overall, the consensus assessment over the past three months stands at moderate buy. Further, the average price target lands at $291.82, implying 3% growth.Story continuesAgain, it’s not the most exciting entity among stocks backed by analysts. However, BD enjoys consistent profitability, thus providing confidence. Also, BDX trades at a forward multiple of 20.79. As a discount to projected earnings, it ranks better than 72% of the competition.Meta Platforms (META)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7One year can make all the difference in the world as social media and technology juggernaut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) can attest. Throughout 2022, a troubling combination of economic headwinds (thanks to hawkish monetary policy), digital advertisement market erosion and struggling traction with the metaverse hurt META considerably. However, 2023 represents an entirely new paradigm, with shares up 136% since the Jan. opener.Most recently, analysts from Mizuho Securities and New Street assigned buy ratings on META stock. Both experts forecasted a price target of $350, implying nearly 19% upside potential. Overall, META carries a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 36 buys, three holds and zero sells over the past three months. On average, the experts believe META will hit $326.45, implying nearly 11% growth.Financially, it’s not difficult to see why the tech giant ranks among the top analyst stocks. Enjoying profitability year in and year out, Meta is also a growth machine. Specifically, its three-year sales expansion rate (per-share basis) clocks in at 20.6%, outpacing 71.48% of its peers.Zscaler (ZS)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comA cybersecurity firm, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) specializes in enterprise cloud security services. Fundamentally, Zscaler operates in a high-demand field. While digital connectivity fostered myriad positive innovations, it also sparked nefarious activities. Increasingly, data breaches and other forms of digital compromising events cost companies billions of dollars collectively. So, it’s no shock that ZS represents one of the top analyst stocks.Speaking of which, BTIG’s Gray Powell assigned ZS stock as a buy. Further, the expert forecasts shares hitting $185, implying over 19% upside potential. Overall, Zscaler carries a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 23 buys, seven holds and zero sells. On average, the experts’ price target lands at $172.41, implying over 11% growth.Financially, ZS presents a bit of a tricky argument. For example, it trades at a forward multiple of 72.52, which is quite rich. At the same time, ZS makes a case for best Wall Street stocks because of its enormous growth, specifically a three-year sales expansion rate of 46.7%.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum StocksSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comOne of the most contentious names among top analyst stocks, brewery Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) landed in hot water recently for a one-off promotion that deeply offended politically conservative buyers of Bud Light, one of Anheuser’s brands. Consistently, Bud Light ranked as America’s top-selling beer, although that’s no longer the case. Obviously, bad PR doesn’t help.However, BUD may still be one of the high-confidence stocks because eventually, controversies tend to blow over with time. I mean, it wasn’t too long ago that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick set off a fierce debate in America. Now, people don’t even talk about Kaepernick that much. I’m sure this, too, will pass.In the meantime, BUD symbolizes one of the top 7 analysts’ favorite stocks. A few days ago, Morgan Stanley’s Sarah Simon initiated coverage of BUD with a buy rating. As well, the expert believes shares will hit $68.50, implying 17% upside potential. Overall, BUD carries a moderate buy consensus view with an average price target of $69.05, implying 18% growth.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (HST)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comMoving onto riskier ideas for top analyst stocks, Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NASDAQ:HST) is structured as a real estate investment trust. As you might imagine from its corporate name, the enterprise invests in hotel properties. So far this year, HST performs okay, with shares gaining nearly 10%. That’s not remarkable considering that the benchmark equities index is almost double the performance.Still, HST happens to be one of the stocks backed by analysts. On the bullish side, Oppenheimer’s Tyler Batory upgraded HST to a buy. As well, the expert forecasts a $22 price target, implying nearly 26% upside potential. Overall, the consensus view for HST comes in as a moderate buy. The experts’ average price target lands at $20.25, implying almost 16% growth.Financially, it appears that analysts believe in the narrative of revenge travel more so than the objective data. For example, investment data aggregator Gurufocus warns its readers that HST may be a possible value trap. Still, with shares trading at 8.53X funds from operation (FFO), Host Hotels could be undervalued.Harley-Davidson (HOG)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comAn iconic motorcycle company, Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) riders probably won’t be caught dead with Bud Light at this juncture. Essentially a throwback to a more rugged time in American history, Harley may have some difficulty gaining traction with today’s youth. Still, Harley is evolving, with the icon moving into electric-powered motorcycles with its Livewire brand. From what I understand, these Livewire bikes are a real thrill.Perhaps that’s why this old HOG still ranks among the top analyst stocks. A few days ago, D.A. Davidson’s Brandon Rolle upgraded shares to a buy. Also, a few days before that, BMO Capital assigned a buy rating with a $57 price target, implying nearly 53% upside potential. Overall, HOG rates as a moderate buy with an average price target of $45.67, implying over 22% growth.What might appeal to speculators of the best Wall Street stocks is the value proposition. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 7.74. As a discount to projected earnings, Harley-Davidson ranks better than 79.53% of the competition.Coeur Mining (CDE)image of businessperson and bar graph with dollar signs to represent undervalued stocksSource: Wright Studio/Shutterstock.comFundamentally, the equation for precious metals mining firm Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) seems simple. With the Federal Reserve struggling to combat stubbornly high prices, it has a long-term hawkish view. That’s going to tighten the money supply, which in turn will hurt CDE. Perhaps to little surprise, since the Jan. opener, shares stumbled 5%. So, why is Coeur one of the top analyst stocks?A few days ago, Canaccord Genuity’s Dalton Baretto upgraded CDE to a buy. As well, the expert forecasted a price of $3.75, implying just over 16% upside potential. Overall, Coeur carries a consensus view of moderate buy. On average, the price target stands at $4, implying nearly 24% growth.Financially, Coeur presents a challenging framework to put it diplomatically. For instance, its Altman Z-Score sits at 1.24 below zero, indicating a distressed business. As well, the company carries too much debt. At the same time, the company is attractively priced against tangible book value. Further, economic uncertainty might spark the fear trade, which could help lift CDE.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:PM) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.7bUS$11.6bUS$12.2bUS$12.8bUS$13.3bUS$13.7bUS$14.1bUS$14.5bUS$14.9bUS$15.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Est @ 5.65%Est @ 4.59%Est @ 3.84%Est @ 3.32%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.70%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.40% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$10.0kUS$10.0kUS$9.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.3kUS$9.0kUS$8.6kUS$8.2kUS$7.8kUS$7.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$90bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.1%) = US$296bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$296b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$145bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$235b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$99.7, the company appears quite good value at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.886. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

PPG, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. AXTA and Livent Corp. LTHM.Industry: Specialty ChemicalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2129784/3-chemical-specialty-stocks-to-escape-industry-headwindsThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry is facing headwinds from sluggish demand, partly due to a slowdown in Europe and the lingering impacts of COVID-related restrictions on China's economy. Margins of companies in this space also remain under pressure due to elevated supply chain, logistics and input costs.Industry players like PPG Industries, Inc., Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. and Livent Corp. are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions to tide over a still-challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry consists of manufacturers of specialty chemical products for a host of end-use markets such as textile, paper, automotive, electronics, personal care, energy, construction, food &amp; beverages and agriculture. These chemicals (including catalysts, surfactants, specialty polymers, coating additives, pesticides and oilfield chemicals) are used based on their performance and have a specific purpose.Specialty chemicals can be single molecules or a combination of molecules referred to as formulations, and they provide a vast range of effects upon which various industries rely. Their compositions significantly influence the performance of the finished products. Specialty chemicals have applications in the manufacturing process of a vast range of products, including paints and coatings, cosmetics, petroleum products, inks and plastics.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemical Specialty Industry?Headwinds From Demand Slowdown: Companies in the chemical specialty space face headwinds from customer destocking and softness in building and construction and industrial end markets, especially in Europe and China, due to the economic slowdown. New lockdowns following a resurgence in coronavirus infections have taken a significant toll on China's economy.Story continuesMoreover, the ongoing geopolitical tension, elevated energy costs and high inflation have resulted in a decline in demand in Europe. A weak automotive market in China is also a concern. The demand slowdown is expected to weigh on volumes of chemical specialty companies over the short term.Input Cost Pressure a Worry: Specialty chemical makers are facing headwinds from raw material cost inflation, and supply-chain and freight transportation disruptions. The closure of a large swath of factories to stem the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted the global supply chain. This has affected the availability of key raw materials for the chemical specialty industry. Some of the companies are also facing challenges from elevated logistics and labor costs.The shipping bottlenecks have led to a surge in freight costs. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and new lockdowns in China have put further pressure on the global supply chain. The lingering impacts of supply-chain and logistic bottlenecks are expected to continue over the short haul and exert pressure on the margins of chemical specialty companies.Self-Help Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are executing a raft of self-help measures — including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, expansion into high-growth markets, restructuring, operational efficiency improvement, and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows — in a bid to stay afloat amid the prevailing headwinds. Notably, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to cut costs. The measures are likely to help the companies sail through the ongoing challenges.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Downbeat ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Specialty industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a bleak near term.

Economic Educator, Creator, and Author Kyla Scanlon outlines how consumers are paying upwards of $1,300 to see Swift in concert, ""showing us that the consumer is willing and able to spend."" When asked about the Barbie-Swift growth indicators, Fed Chair Jerome Powell even stated ""stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation"" in turn calling for necessary monetary policy.Scanlon notes the pent-up demand for travel and elevated savings as consumer spending searches for normalcy in the post-pandemic era: ""consumer sentiment is at an all-time high [and] it's a little confusing to figure out what people are going to do.""Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Have we entered a girl boss economy here? Interest rate hikes were expected to slow demand and rein in decades high inflation, but consumers have been defying all that recessionary talk and continue to spend on tickets for Taylor Swift, ""Barbie"", and Beyonce.Joining us now, we've got Kyla Scanlon, who is the author, educator, and creator. Kyla, have you been to all of these events? Have you already hit the hat trick on both ""Barbie"", Taylor Swift, and Beyonce?KYLA SCANLON: I actually haven't. No, I haven't achieved that quite yet.BRAD SMITH: Well, some people out there are trying to do it.[LAUGHTER]I am not in the camp that's achieved all of it either. But what is it telling us right now about the state of the consumer?KYLA SCANLON: It's showing that the consumer has some resiliency. So people are willing and able to spend on big events like this. People are spending about $1,300 on average to go to see Taylor Swift, which I think is really phenomenal and really impressive just in terms of what Taylor Swift can do. So I think it's showing us that the consumer is willing and able to spend.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah. I mean, well, obviously, ""Barbie"" and Beyonce, to your point also, part of that phenomenon there is that propensity to spend now. You put out a recent video where you also talked about kind of does it keep going? Are there other-- I mean, Taylor can't. She's not the Grateful Dead or Phish. She's not going to tour forever, right? So at some point, the tour is going to stop, and people won't be going to see her. So does that mean that we're going to see spending fall?KYLA SCANLON: Yeah. I mean, maybe. That's one thing that I talk about in the video. I think there's a lot of worries around student loan debt payments starting back up and if people will be able to finance those because that's going to be a big hit to a lot of people's incomes.And then I think Taylor Swift was definitely like a summer boost. And ""Barbie"" happening at the same time, people were just like, yes, I'll go and do all of these experiences. People really want to spend on experiences right now. So I think it'll be interesting in the post-Taylor Swift policy era to see what happens, but there are some headwinds that I think we should be paying attention to for sure.BRAD SMITH: What are those headwinds?KYLA SCANLON: I think the student loan debt repayments starting back up. I think credit card spend, you know that's always seemingly at a record high. Real wages are finally ticking up so that could be a bit of a tailwind, I suppose, if I'm using those two terms correctly. But yeah, I think we're just going to see consumers maybe not have as much discretionary income as they did. Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: Do you think that the sort of-- I also wonder like once you get the fix, I know if you're Swifty, the fix is never satisfied, right? Like if people can go see her multiple times, they will. But, you know, once you've done your international trip, for example, to just give another example of stuff that people are spending on, I just wondered like how long people's desires and wallets can sustain this kind of stuff?KYLA SCANLON: Yeah. I mean, I guess like people said that they would go and watch her again, and that they would spend $1,300 again to go and see her. So I think there's the willingness to do it. I do think that we'll probably see a little bit of a slowdown going back into school and going back into the fall.But I think yeah, once you kind of have that one experience, it might be enough for a while. But presumably consumers could go and spend on other things too like there's a lot of experiences out there. But I do think Taylor Swift was-- that whole concert series was just such a boost to local economies. It's really cool, I think, what she was able to achieve within each city that she visited.BRAD SMITH: I consistently loved your whiteboard behind you every time you join us here, and I can see that you map out a lot of things here. And so, when consumers eventually do trade down from the $1,300 Taylor Swift ticket or the $900, at least that's the price that I saw, Beyonce Renaissance Tour ticket, what do they trade down to, and who does that begin to benefit in other parts of the spending economy?KYLA SCANLON: Yeah, I think it'd be interesting consumers end up spending on. You know, people had more cash flow over the past few years because of the pandemic and just extra savings. And they weren't really contributing a bunch of that to paying off debt. They were just doing more experiences.So I think there's still-- you know we were-- the pandemic was sort of a long time, so I think that people were locked inside for a long time, and they're still probably going to be the desire to consume and go and have experiences. In terms of what people go and spend on, I'm not sure.But there seems to be a desire for travel. Like Southwest Airlines had record revenue. Hilton was talking about how many people are going and staying at their hotels, so I think that there's still going to be people doing all of these things as long as they're able to. Yeah.BRAD SMITH: And then additionally here, I mean, I'm just looking behind you. You've got travel, flights, airlines, all of this kind of travel and accommodation experience that many of us for the pent up demand that we've heard about from airline CEOs, from accommodation CEOs, that they say is still in place.How for the consumer do they start to think about, all right, where do we kind of pull back on some of that spending as well in order to monitor where else we've got to either carve down some of that debt that's being incurred on the credit cards or just ensure that household balance sheets are still healthy?KYLA SCANLON: I don't know. It's kind of interesting. Like consumer sentiment is at an all-time high. So it's a little bit confusing to figure out exactly what people are going to do because people are feeling pretty good. Real wages, as I said, are starting to tick back up. Obviously, credit card debt is at an all-time high. People are taking out loans and trying to finance different things.So I'm not sure what that spending will shift to or if it will just sort of stay in this entertainment category. We've seen people really choose to consume services over goods over the past few years since the world sort of reopened, so I think that trend will continue.I can't imagine anything that-- I mean, obviously there's a lot of things that could prevent that from happening. But I do think that is the way that the consumer tends to be going is consuming experiences right now.JULIE HYMAN: Kyla, good to see you. Kyla Scanlon, author, educator, and creator. Always good to catch up with you. Appreciate it.KYLA SCANLON: Yeah. Thanks for having me on.]"

LEG reported tepid second-quarter 2023 results wherein earnings and sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Furthermore, the bottom and the top lines declined on a year-over-year basis.

The metric also declined 8% from the prior-year quarter’s levels of $1.33 billion.Organically, sales were down 11% year over year. Raw-material-related selling prices ailed the results by 5%. Volume was down 6% due to continued demand softness in residential end markets, partially offset by growth in the Automotive, Aerospace, and Hydraulic Cylinders businesses. Currency impact on sales was flat year over year. That said, acquisitions contributed 3% to sales growth.Adjusted EBIT declined 36% from the prior-year quarter’s levels to $92.1 million. The downside was due to lower volume in residential end markets and lower metal margin in the Steel Rod business. This was partially offset by $3.6 million gain from net insurance proceeds from tornado damage at the company’s Home Furniture manufacturing facility.Adjusted EBIT margin contracted 320 basis points (bps) to 7.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.

Volumes are expected to decline mid-single digits at the midpoint. Raw-material-related price decrease and currency impact are likely to reduce sales by mid-single digits, while acquisitions are expected to aid the same by 3%.Sales are likely to be down mid to high-single digits in the Bedding Products and Furniture, Flooring &amp; Textile Products segments. Nonetheless, the same is expected to be up high single-digits in Specialized Products.Earnings are projected to be between $1.45 per share and $1.65 per share (previously expected in the range of $1.50-$1.90 per share).

122,421ed1b9-d647-3e86-a704-9df05cca1e1f,NTRS,2023-08-02,Northern Trust Pension Universe Data: Canadian Pension Plans Carve out Positive Q2 Returns Amidst Inflationary Headwinds,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-pension-universe-data-140000684.html,1690898400,STORY,"['NTRS', 'NTRSO']","[TORONTO, August 01, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Canadian Pension plan investment returns concluded the first half of the year in a position of strength, according to the Northern Trust Canada Universe. The median Canadian Pension Plan returned 1.0% for the quarter ending June 30 and 5.3% year-to-date.The Northern Trust Canada universe tracks the performance of Canadian institutional defined benefit plans that subscribe to performance measurement services as part of Northern Trust’s asset service offerings.The second quarter of 2023 witnessed a resilient global economy against a backdrop of sticky inflation, higher interest rates, concern about distress in the banking sector and a looming debt ceiling in the U.S. Although fears of banking problems subsided and a U.S. government borrowing resolution was achieved, persistent inflation and tight labor markets weighed on the minds of global monetary authorities. Many major central banks around the world continued a restrictive path, while in North America a recalibration effort appeared to be underway. The U.S. Federal Reserve took a pause in June from hiking rates only to assess the productivity of its tightening journey over the last year. The Bank of Canada (BoC) reinstituted an interest rate hike in the quarter following an abbreviated pause over the last three months, as it strives to relieve pricing pressures that have rippled across the economy. Resiliency held firm, enabling global developed equity markets to close the quarter on a higher note, while bond returns weakened as yields rose.""The first half of 2023 presented many challenges in the financial markets with the primary focus on the battle against inflation. In this environment, pension plans have benefited from a growing trend towards alternative investments, given the diversification and underlying hedging feature embedded in this asset class. As we wait for the inflation pendulum to swing back to more normalized levels, higher interest rates continue to provide a cushion for the funding health of Canadian Pension Plans,"" said Katie Pries, President and CEO of Northern Trust Canada.Story continuesThe strength of corporate and consumer balance sheets remained supportive of economic growth in the second quarter, enabling financial markets to look past the headwind of a lingering inflation cloud and restrictive monetary path. Global developed equity markets advanced higher for the period, generating positive returns for the quarter, while Canadian bond returns were dampened by the continued volatile movement in interest rates.Canadian Equities, as measured by the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, returned 1.1% for the quarter. Information Technology was the top performer for the quarter, followed by the Consumer Discretionary sector, while the Materials, Real Estate and Consumer Staples sectors posted the weakest results for the period.U.S. Equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500 Index, advanced 6.3% in CAD for the quarter with seven of the 11 sectors posting positive results. Information Technology, Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors led the way with double digit returns, while the Utilities and Energy sectors observed the largest decline for the period.International developed markets, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index, recorded 0.9% in CAD for the quarter. The stronger performers were the Industrials, Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary sectors, while the Communication Services, Real Estate and Materials sectors were the largest decliners for the period.The MSCI Emerging Markets Index declined -1.2% in CAD for the quarter, with four of the 11 sectors generating positive returns. The Energy, Financials and Information Technology sectors observed the strongest performance, while the Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary and Real Estate sectors witnessed the largest declines.The Canadian economy remained resilient during the period, however household debt in Canada is now the highest of any G7 country, representing 107% of GDP. The unemployment rate advanced slightly higher in June, to 5.4% from 5.0% in April. Inflation readings are trending lower versus previous quarters, however it remains above the Bank of Canada (BoC) target. Canadian CPI for June was 2.8% versus 4.3% for March.The U.S. economy continued on a forward march as fears of the looming U.S. debt ceiling and further banking failures receded. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked interest rates in May by 25 basis points taking the Federal Funds Target Rate to 5.0% - 5.25%. The Fed held rates steady in June as it continues to assess the impact of inflationary pressures and a tight labor market.International markets generated positive returns for the quarter despite the impact of tightening financial conditions. The European Central Bank (ECB) continued its restrictive path, raising rates by a total of 50 bps in an effort to combat inflation. The Bank of England (BoE) continued its aggressive tightening by raising interest rates 75 bps during the quarter, including a 50 bps hike in June. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) chose to maintain its current monetary policy and announced its strategy to continue with bond purchases to keep an anchor on interest rates.Emerging Markets witnessed a decline (in CAD terms) during the quarter, lagging developed market counterparts. The Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 bps for the first time since August of 2022. While China struggled with its manufacturing sector, Turkey’s central bank raised interest rates from 8.5% to 15% as it strives to tame inflation and return to more conventional monetary policy.The Bank of Canada (BoC) raised interest rates by 25 bps to 4.75% in June following a brief pause, bringing Canadian interest rates to a 22 year high. The BoC maintains a hawkish stance given the persistent demand in the economy and inflation remains above its 2% target.The Canadian Fixed Income market, as measured by the FTSE Canada Universe Bond Index, declined -0.7% for the quarter. Corporate bonds led with positive returns for the quarter, while Federal and Provincial bonds witnessed negative returns. Long-term bonds returned 0.6%, outpacing both the short and mid-term segments which declined for the period.About Northern TrustNorthern Trust Corporation (Nasdaq: NTRS) is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking to corporations, institutions, affluent families and individuals.

Analysts on average had expected $1.59, according to Refinitiv data.AIG's life and retirement unit saw a 42% jump in premiums and deposits, partly helped by record sales in fixed index annuities.Total consolidated net investment income rose 37% to $3.6 billion, helped by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loan portfolios due to the higher reinvestment rates.The New York-based company's general insurance underwriting income fell 26%, hurt by $250 million in total catastrophe-related charges mainly related to U.S. storms and Typhoon Mawar, which hit the Western Pacific Island of Guam in May.Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re preliminarily pegged global insured losses from natural hazards in the first six months of 2023 at $52 billion, while weather and climate events alone were expected to have driven an insurance bill of $46 billion.Last month, peer insurer Travelers Companies reported a 98% slump in quarterly profit, as severe storms in parts of the United States caused the insurer's catastrophe losses net of reinsurance to jump to $1.48 billion.AIG's general insurance accident year combined ratio was 88%, compared with 88.5%, a year earlier. The metric excludes catastrophe losses and a ratio below 100 signifies that the insurer earns more from premiums than it pays out in claims.AIG also said it increased its share repurchase authorization to $7.5 billion.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru)]"

(NYSE: AIG) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.AIG Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer Peter Zaffino said: ""In the second quarter, we continued to build on our momentum, delivering outstanding financial results as well as successfully executing on multiple strategic priorities. Second quarter adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders per diluted common share was $1.75, AIG’s highest adjusted EPS since 2007, representing another significant milestone on our path toward sustainable earnings growth over the long-term.""Our ability to continue to grow, manage volatility and improve profitability reflects our commitment to underwriting and operational excellence. In addition to our strong financial performance, our team executed on several transactions that will simplify AIG, reduce volatility, generate liquidity and capital efficiencies, and allow us to accelerate our capital management plans.""In General Insurance, continued accident year underwriting margin improvement and strong growth resulted in yet another quarter of excellent financial results. Net premiums written increased 11%† year-over-year and Commercial Lines net premiums written grew 13%† driven by strong growth in North America Commercial Lines of 18%†. North America Commercial rate increased 8% or 9% excluding Workers’ Compensation while International Commercial rate increased 9%.""The General Insurance combined ratio was 90.9%, inclusive of $250 million of catastrophe losses, or 3.9 loss ratio points, a tremendous result against the backdrop of a very challenging quarter for the industry. The second quarter accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT, was 88.0% and the lowest ratio recorded for the second quarter since 2007. This ratio improved by 50 basis points year-over-year and was driven by an excellent Global Commercial accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT, of 84.4%.""Life &amp; Retirement delivered very good results, with premiums and deposits of over $10 billion, a 42% increase year-over-year, benefiting from record sales in Fixed Index Annuities. Results included strong continued base net investment spread expansion.""With respect to capital management, we continued to execute against our balanced strategy. In the second quarter, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 12.5% to $0.36 per share, representing the first increase since 2016 and we returned $822 million to shareholders through $554 million of AIG common stock repurchases and $268 million of dividends.""In May, we announced the sale of Validus Re to RenaissanceRe for $3 billion, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we announced and successfully completed the sale of AIG’s Crop Risk Services business to American Financial Group, Inc. for approximately $240 million. We also launched Private Client Select as a Managing General Agency with our partner Stone Point Capital LLC that will serve as an independent platform for the high and ultra-high net worth markets.""In June, we completed a secondary offering of Corebridge Financial common stock. Furthermore, Corebridge issued a $400 million special dividend to its shareholders and executed the repurchase of $200 million of common stock from AIG and Blackstone. Including approximately $600 million in regular dividends, these actions resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of total capital returned to Corebridge shareholders since its initial public offering in September 2022. As a result of these actions, AIG received gross proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion and reduced its ownership in Corebridge to 65.3%.""The scale of what AIG colleagues accomplished in the second quarter is extraordinary. I am more confident than ever in AIG’s promising future as we continue our journey to be a top performing company delivering excellence in all that we do and creating sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders.""† On a constant dollar basis for North America and on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination for International. These measures are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (non-GAAP); definitions of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their closest GAAP measures can be found in this news release under the heading Comment on Regulation G and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.For the second quarter of 2023, pre-tax income from continuing operations was $1.9 billion, compared to $3.9 billion in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to AIG common shareholders was $1.5 billion, or $2.03 per diluted common share, compared to $2.7 billion, or $3.43 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The decline in pre-tax income was primarily driven by a decrease in net realized gains on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative as well as a decrease in net realized gains excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative, higher catastrophe losses, lower net favorable prior year development (PYD) and higher interest crediting rates at Life and Retirement. The decline was partially offset by higher net investment income and continued improvement in accident year underwriting margin. These pre-tax items were partially offset by lower income tax expense due to a decrease in income from continuing operations and lower income attributable to the noncontrolling interest (NCI) due to a decrease in net income at Corebridge compared to the prior year quarter despite higher income attributable to NCI as a result of lower AIG ownership in Corebridge.AATI was $1.3 billion, or $1.75 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $1.1 billion, or $1.39 per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter. The increase in AATI was due to higher Life and Retirement results, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and lower net favorable PYD.Total consolidated net investment income for the second quarter of 2023 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 37% from $2.6 billion in the prior year quarter, benefiting from higher income from fixed maturity securities and loan portfolios due to the higher reinvestment rates on new investments and floating rate securities. Total net investment income on an APTI basis* was $3.3 billion, an increase of $774 million from the prior year quarter.Book value per common share was $58.49 as of June 30, 2023, a decrease of 1% from March 31, 2023 and an increase of 6% from December 31, 2022. The decrease from March 31, 2023 was driven by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) due to increased interest rates and the increase from December 31, 2022 was driven by a decrease in AOCI as a result of the Corebridge secondary offering and share repurchases discussed above. Adjusted book value per common share* was $75.76, almost flat compared to March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Adjusted tangible book value per common share* was $69.99, an increase of approximately 1% from both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.In the second quarter of 2023, AIG repurchased $554 million of common stock, or approximately 10 million shares, paid $268 million of common and preferred dividends and repaid $388 million of debt maturities. AIG also received proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion from the Corebridge secondary offering, $264 million from the Corebridge special dividend and $180 million from the Corebridge share repurchase, contributing to parent liquidity of $4.3 billion as of June 30, 2023. AIG’s ratio of total debt and preferred stock to total capital at June 30, 2023 was 32.3%, down from 32.8% at March 31, 2023, primarily driven by repayment of $388 million of debt and the Corebridge secondary offering. Excluding AOCI, the total debt and preferred stock to total capital ratio* was 26.0% at June 30, 2023.On August 1, the AIG Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on AIG common stock of $0.36 per share. The dividend is payable on September 29, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2023.The AIG Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $365.625 per share on AIG Series A 5.85% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, which is represented by depositary shares (NYSE: AIG PRA), each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock. Holders of depositary shares will receive $0.365625 per depositary share. The dividend is payable on September 15, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on August 31, 2023.FINANCIAL SUMMARYThree Months EndedJune 30,($ in millions, except per common share amounts)20222023Net income attributable to AIG common shareholders$2,746$1,485Net income per diluted share attributable to AIG common shareholders$3.43$2.03Adjusted pre-tax income (loss)$1,543$1,890General Insurance1,2571,319Life and Retirement747991Other Operations(461)(420)Net investment income$2,604$3,571Net investment income, APTI basis2,5043,278Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders$1,111$1,282Adjusted after-tax income per diluted share attributable to AIG common shareholders$1.39$1.75Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (in millions)800.7730.5Return on common equity21.7%14.0%Adjusted return on common equity7.7%9.4%Book value per common share$58.64$58.49Adjusted book value per common share$73.78$75.76Common shares outstanding (in millions)771.3717.5GENERAL INSURANCEThree Months Ended June 30,($ in millions)20222023ChangeGross premiums written$9,581$10,3999%Net premiums written$6,866$7,53710%North America3,4013,97317North America Commercial Lines2,9183,41017North America Personal Insurance48356317International3,4653,5643International Commercial Lines2,0372,2239International Personal Insurance1,4281,341(6)Underwriting income (loss)$799$594(26)%North America406352(13)North America Commercial Lines416403(3)North America Personal Insurance(10)(51)(410)International393242(38)International Commercial Lines349216(38)International Personal Insurance4426(41)Net investment income, APTI basis$458$72558%Adjusted pre-tax income$1,257$1,3195%Return on adjusted segment common equity12.0%12.2%0.2ptsUnderwriting ratios:North America Combined Ratio (CR)86.389.02.7ptsNorth America Commercial Lines CR83.685.62.0North America Personal Insurance CR102.3112.910.6International CR88.592.64.1International Commercial Lines CR82.489.06.6International Personal Insurance CR96.998.01.1General Insurance (GI) CR87.490.93.5GI Loss ratio56.259.33.1ptsLess: impact on loss ratioCatastrophe losses and reinstatement premiums(1.8)(3.9)(2.1)Prior year development, net of reinsurance and prior year premiums2.91.0(1.9)GI Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted57.356.4(0.9)GI Expense ratio31.231.60.4GI Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted88.588.0(0.5)Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR):North America AYCR89.987.8(2.1)ptsNorth America Commercial Lines AYCR88.285.1(3.1)North America Personal Insurance AYCR99.7107.17.4International AYCR87.288.00.8International Commercial Lines AYCR81.483.11.7International Personal Insurance AYCR95.295.30.1General InsuranceSecond quarter 2023 NPW of $7.5 billion was a 10% increase from the prior year quarter, or 11% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination, driven by Commercial Lines. North America Commercial Lines delivered 17% NPW growth, or 18% on a constant dollar basis, from the prior year quarter, benefiting from positive rate changes, higher renewal retentions and strong new business production, particularly in Retail Property, Lexington and Validus Re, partially offset by continued selectivity in Financial Lines Director &amp; Officer and transactional products. International Commercial Lines delivered 9% NPW growth, or 6% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination, from the prior year quarter, attributed to continued positive rate changes and strong new business production, mainly in Property and Global Specialty, partially offset by headwinds from a lack of capital market transaction activity. Global Personal Insurance NPW decreased 0.4%, but grew 5% on a constant dollar basis and adjusted for the International lag elimination, from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by growth in Private Client Group resulting from changes in our reinsurance program, partially offset by a decrease in Travel and Warranty.Second quarter 2023 underwriting income was $594 million and included $250 million of total catastrophe-related charges, representing 3.9 loss ratio points, of which $159 million was in North America, mainly attributable to U.S. convective storms, and $91 million in International, mainly attributable to Typhoon Mawar, compared to $121 million, or 1.8 loss ratio points, in the prior year quarter. Second quarter 2023 also included lower favorable PYD of $115 million compared to favorable PYD of $202 million in the prior year quarter.The combined ratio was 90.9%, a 3.5 point increase from the prior year quarter, driven by a 3.1 point increase in the loss ratio. The AYCR improved 0.5 point from the prior year quarter to 88.0%, driven by a 0.9 point decrease in the accident year loss ratio, as adjusted* (AYLR) to 56.4%, reflecting continued earn-in of premium rate increases exceeding loss cost trends in Commercial Lines. The AYCR improvement also reflects business mix benefit, continued positive rate changes, focused risk selection and improved terms and conditions. The expense ratio was 31.6%, a 0.4 point increase from the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in the general operating expense ratio while the acquisition ratio remained flat.The North America Commercial Lines combined ratio was 85.6% and International Commercial Lines combined ratio was 89.0%, a 2.0 point and a 6.6 point increase, respectively, from the prior year quarter. The AYCR for North America Commercial Lines improved 3.1 points from the prior year quarter to 85.1%, with a 2.8 point improvement in AYLR. The AYCR for International Commercial Lines increased 1.7 points from the prior year quarter to 83.1% due to a higher general operating expense ratio driven by changes in business mix.The North America Personal Insurance combined ratio increased 10.6 points to 112.9% and the AYCR increased 7.4 points to 107.1% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher catastrophe losses, changes in business mix, reinsurance cessions and an increase in general operating expense ratio attributable to the decline in premiums earned. The International Personal Insurance combined ratio increased 1.1 points to 98.0% and the AYCR increased 0.1 point to 95.3% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher catastrophe losses and a higher expense ratio, partially offset by improvement in the AYLR from changes in business mix and reflecting earned-in rate exceeding loss costs.General Insurance return on adjusted segment common equity* for the second quarter was 12.2% on an annualized basis, compared with 12.0% in the prior year quarter.LIFE AND RETIREMENTThree Months EndedJune 30,($ in millions, except as indicated)20222023ChangeAdjusted pre-tax income$747$99133%Individual Retirement37058558Group Retirement18020112Life Insurance12078(35)Institutional Markets7712765Premiums and fees$1,846$3,23875%Individual Retirement246238(3)Group Retirement109106(3)Life Insurance946934(1)Institutional Markets5451,960260Premiums and deposits$7,099$10,05442%Individual Retirement3,6204,04512Group Retirement1,7721,9239Life Insurance1,1571,1762Institutional Markets5502,910429Net flows$80$(2105)NM%Individual Retirement628(359)NMGroup Retirement(548)(1,746)(219)Net investment income, APTI basis$1,989$2,47825%Return on adjusted segment common equity9.7%12.2%2.5ptsLife and RetirementLife and Retirement reported APTI of $991 million for the second quarter of 2023, up 33% from $747 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by higher base portfolio income, partially offset by a decline in alternative investment returns and fee income. Base net investment spreads in Individual and Group Retirement continued to widen with a 64-basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by higher reinvestment rates.Premiums increased 128% to $2.5 billion from $1.1 billion and premiums and deposits increased 42% to $10.1 billion from $7.1 billion in the prior year quarter. The second quarter saw record sales in Fixed Index Annuities and a higher volume of transactional businesses with $1.9 billion of pension risk transfer activity and $0.9 billion of guaranteed investment contracts.The balance sheet and the capital position of the business continue to remain strong. During the second quarter, Corebridge returned approximately $750 million to its shareholders (including AIG) through approximately $550 million of common stock dividends and $200 million in share repurchases.Life and Retirement return on adjusted segment common equity* for the second quarter was 12.2% on an annualized basis, compared with 9.7% in the prior year quarter.OTHER OPERATIONSThree Months EndedJune 30,($ in millions)20222023ChangeCorporate and Other$(494)$(414)16%Asset Management Group163(9)NMAdjusted pre-tax loss before consolidation and eliminations(331)(423)(28)Consolidation and eliminations(130)3NMAdjusted pre-tax loss$(461)$(420)9%Other OperationsOther Operations adjusted pre-tax loss (APTL) of $420 million improved $41 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), in addition to better results from Corporate and Other.Corporate and Other APTL improved $80 million, or 16%, from the prior year quarter, largely due to the absence of mark-to-market losses on a legacy investment portfolio that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as higher income from short-term investments as a result of high short-term yields on parent liquidity funds.Asset Management Group (AMG) APTL decreased $172 million from the prior year quarter largely due to lower net investment income associated with VIEs compared to the prior year quarter, which reflected gains on sales. AMG results in the second quarter also reflected the sale of our Collateralized Loan Obligations manager in the first quarter of 2023 and the subsequent deconsolidation of associated securitizations by the end of the second quarter, which resulted in lower investment income and an offsetting impact on interest expense with minimal impact to APTL.Changes in Consolidation and eliminations were attributed to realized capital gains associated with VIEs, which the insurance subsidiaries report as net investment income and are eliminated in Other Operations.CONFERENCE CALLAIG will host a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, August 2, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. ET to review these results.

Some of the measurements AIG uses are ""Non-GAAP financial measures"" under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures AIG presents are listed below and may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Regulation G are included within the relevant tables attached to this news release or in the Second Quarter 2023 Financial Supplement available in the Investors section of AIG’s website, www.aig.com.Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context indicates otherwise, we use the terms ""AIG,"" ""we,"" ""us"" and ""our"" to refer to American International Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.AIG uses the following operating performance measures because AIG believes they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of AIG’s business segments. AIG believes they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with AIG’s insurance competitors. When AIG uses these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis.Book value per common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets (DTA) (Adjusted book value per common share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per-common share basis after eliminating items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1) of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets held by AIG in support of Fortitude Re’s reinsurance obligations to AIG post deconsolidation of Fortitude Re (Fortitude Re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in these book value per common share metrics. Adjusted book value per common share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and DTA (Adjusted common shareholders’ equity), by total common shares outstanding.Book Value per Common Share, Excluding Goodwill, Value of Business Acquired (VOBA), Value of Distribution Channel Acquired (VODA), Other Intangible Assets, AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) (Adjusted Tangible Book Value per Common Share) is used to provide more accurate measure of the realizable value of shareholder on a per-common share basis. Adjusted Tangible Book Value per Common Share is derived by dividing Total AIG common shareholders’ equity, excluding intangible assets, AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets, and DTA (Adjusted Tangible Common Shareholders’ Equity), by total common shares outstanding.AIG Return on Common Equity (ROCE) – Adjusted After-tax Income Excluding AOCI adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and DTA (Adjusted return on common equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders’ equity. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, including changes in fair value (1) of AIG’s available for sale securities portfolio, (2) of market risk benefits attributable to our own credit risk and (3) due to discount rates used to measure traditional and limited payment long-duration insurance contracts, foreign currency translation adjustments and U.S. tax attribute deferred tax assets. This measure also eliminates the asymmetrical impact resulting from changes in fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio wherein there is largely no offsetting impact for certain related insurance liabilities. In addition, we adjust for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. We exclude deferred tax assets representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits as they have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included in Adjusted Return on Common Equity. Adjusted Return on Common Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity.General Insurance and Life and Retirement Adjusted Segment Common Equity is based on segment equity adjusted for the attribution of debt and preferred stock (Segment Common Equity) and is consistent with AIG’s Adjusted Common Shareholders’ Equity definition.General Insurance and Life and Retirement Return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity – Adjusted After-tax Income (Return on adjusted segment common equity) is used to show the rate of return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity. Return on Adjusted Segment Common Equity is derived by dividing actual or annualized Adjusted After-tax Income by Average Adjusted Segment Common Equity.Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to General Insurance and Life and Retirement is derived by subtracting attributed interest expense, income tax expense and attributed dividends on preferred stock from APTI. Attributed debt and the related interest expense and dividends on preferred stock are calculated based on our internal allocation model. Tax expense or benefit is calculated based on an internal attribution methodology that considers among other things the taxing jurisdiction in which the segments conduct business, as well as the deductibility of expenses in those jurisdictions.Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes) and income from elimination of the International reporting lag. Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our segments.Adjusted Pre-tax Income (APTI) is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following:changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits;net change in market risk benefits (MRBs);changes in benefit reserves related to net realized gains and losses;changes in the fair value of equity securities;net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;following deconsolidation of Fortitude Re, net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets;loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt;all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income and interest credited to policyholder account balances);income or loss from discontinued operations;net loss reserve discount benefit (charge);pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees;net gain or loss on divestitures and other;non-operating litigation reserves and settlements;restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization;the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain;integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses;losses from the impairment of goodwill;non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; andincome from elimination of the international reporting lag.Adjusted After-tax Income attributable to AIG common shareholders (AATI) is derived by excluding the tax effected APTI adjustments described above, dividends on preferred stock, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG:deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges;changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; andnet tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.See page 15 for the reconciliation of Net income attributable to AIG to Adjusted After-tax Income Attributable to AIG.Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every $100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios.Accident year loss and Accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT and Accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses (CATs) and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of $10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the $10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management’s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results.Underwriting ratios are computed as follows:Loss ratio = Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred ÷ Net premiums earned (NPE)Acquisition ratio = Total acquisition expenses ÷ NPEGeneral operating expense ratio = General operating expenses ÷ NPEExpense ratio = Acquisition ratio + General operating expense ratioCombined ratio = Loss ratio + Expense ratioCATs and reinstatement premiums = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – (CATs)] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes] – Loss ratioAccident year loss ratio, as adjusted (AYLR ex-CAT) = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums + Adjustment for ceded premium under reinsurance contracts related to prior accident years]Accident year combined ratio, as adjusted (AYCR ex-CAT) = AYLR ex-CAT + Expense ratioPrior year development net of reinsurance and prior year premiums = [Loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred – CATs – PYD] ÷ [NPE +/(-) Reinstatement premiums related to catastrophes +/(-) Prior year premiums] – Loss ratio – CATs and reinstatement premiums ratio.Premiums and deposits: includes direct and assumed amounts received and earned on traditional life insurance policies, group benefit policies and life‑contingent payout annuities, as well as deposits received on universal life, investment‑type annuity contracts, Federal Home Loan Bank funding agreements and mutual funds. We believe the measure of premiums and deposits is useful in understanding customer demand for our products, evolving product trends and our sales performance period over period.Results from discontinued operations are excluded from all of these measures.# # #American International Group, Inc.

HOLX reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents in third-quarter fiscal 2023, down 2.1% year over year. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.7%.The adjustments include charges and benefits related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain asset impairment charges and restructuring and integration/consolidation costs.The company’s GAAP loss per share was 16 cents in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter’s EPS of 90 cents.Revenues in DetailRevenues totaled $984.4 million in the said quarter, dropping 1.8% year over year (down 1.6% at the constant exchange rate or CER). The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%. Lower sales of COVID-19 assays dragged the top line.Segments in DetailIn the fiscal third quarter, U.S. revenues totaled $750.1 million and increased 2.1%. International revenues amounted to $234.3 million, which fell 12.6% year over year or 11.6% at CER.Revenues in the Diagnostics segment declined 21.5% year over year (down 21.3% at CER) to $439.7 million in the quarter under review. Excluding COVID-19 revenues, Diagnostics revenues increased 11.8% on both reported and CER basis.Cytology &amp; Perinatal revenues of $126.8 million were up 9.9% at CER. Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $302.2 million declined 30.4% at CER. Blood Screening revenues of $10.7 million rose 20.2% year over year at CER.Revenues in the Breast Health segment rose 27.4% from the year-ago period’s (up 27.5% at CER) levels to $311.5 million, primarily due to higher capital equipment revenue compared to the prior year period, as an improving semiconductor chip supply environment enabled more gantry deliveries.Revenues in the GYN Surgical business rose 13.9% year over year (up 14.5% at CER) to $144.8 million, driven by solid results from the Company’s hysteroscopic portfolio.Revenues at Skeletal Health increased 24.9% year over year (up 25% at CER) to $27.1 million.Story continuesOperational UpdateIn the fiscal third quarter, the company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) to 60.8%.

However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements included in this news release are based on management’s expectations, estimates and projections as of the date they are made. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and you should not unduly rely on them as they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include: the effects of any widespread public health crisis and its negative impact on commercial activity and demand for refined petroleum products; the inability to timely obtain or maintain permits necessary for capital projects; changes to worldwide government policies relating to renewable fuels and greenhouse gas emissions that adversely affect programs including the renewable fuel standards program, low carbon fuel standards and tax credits for biofuels; fluctuations in NGL, crude oil, and natural gas prices, and petrochemical and refining margins; our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the integration of DCP Midstream, LP (DCP) and our increased economic ownership of DCP; the diversion of management’s time on integration-related matters; the success of the company’s business transformation initiatives and the realization of savings from actions taken in connection therewith; unexpected changes in costs for constructing, modifying or operating our facilities; unexpected difficulties in manufacturing, refining or transporting our products; the level and success of drilling and production volumes around our midstream assets; risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions of actual or potential competitive suppliers and transporters of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels or specialty products; lack of, or disruptions in, adequate and reliable transportation for our NGL, crude oil, natural gas, and refined products; potential liability from litigation or for remedial actions, including removal and reclamation obligations under environmental regulations; failure to complete construction of capital projects on time and within budget; current or contemplated changes in governmental policies or laws that relate to NGL, crude oil, natural gas, refined petroleum products, or renewable fuels that regulate profits, pricing, or taxation, or other regulations that limit or restrict refining, marketing and midstream operations or restrict exports; the inability to comply with governmental regulations or make capital expenditures to maintain compliance with laws; limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets, which may also impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends; potential disruption of our operations due to accidents, weather events, including as a result of climate change, acts of terrorism or cyberattacks; general domestic and international economic and political developments including armed hostilities (including the Russia-Ukraine war), expropriation of assets, and other political, economic or diplomatic developments; international monetary conditions and exchange controls; changes in estimates or projections used to assess fair value of intangible assets, goodwill and property and equipment and/or strategic decisions with respect to our asset portfolio that cause impairment charges; investments required, or reduced demand for products, as a result of environmental rules and regulations; changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations (including alternative energy mandates); political and societal concerns about climate change that could result in changes to our business or increase expenditures, including litigation-related expenses; the operation, financing and distribution decisions of equity affiliates we do not control; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting Phillips 66’s businesses generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Phillips 66 is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information—This news release includes the terms ""adjusted earnings,"" ""adjusted pre-tax income (loss),"" and ""adjusted pre-tax costs."" These are non-GAAP financial measures that are included to help facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods and to help facilitate comparisons with other companies in our industry, by excluding items that do not reflect the core operating results of our businesses in the current period. References in the release to earnings refer to net income attributable to Phillips 66.This news release also includes the terms ""sustaining capital"" and ""adjusted EBITDA,"" which are non-GAAP financial measures. Sustaining capital is a component of total capital expenditures, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA, as used in this release, is a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure. EBITDA is defined as estimated net income plus estimated net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as estimated EBITDA plus the proportional share of selected equity affiliates’ estimated net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization less the portion of estimated adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the consolidated company and income before income taxes is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA estimates depend on future levels of revenues and expenses, including amounts that will be attributable to noncontrolling interests, which are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, we cannot provide a reconciliation between projected adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income or segment income before income taxes without unreasonable effort.Basis of Presentation— During the fourth quarter of 2022, we changed the internal financial information reviewed by our chief executive officer to evaluate results and allocate resources to reflect the realignment of certain businesses between segments and business lines. We determined this realignment resulted in a change in the composition of our operating segments. Accordingly, results in the second quarter of 2022 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2022, have been recast for comparability. The primary effects of this realignment included moving the results of certain processing assets at our Sweeny and Lake Charles refineries from the Midstream segment (NGL and Other) to the Refining segment. Additionally, commissions charged to the Refining segment by the Marketing and Specialties segment related to sales of specialty products were eliminated and the costs of the sales organization were reclassified from the Marketing and Specialties segment to the Refining segment. Additionally, we no longer present disaggregated business line results for our Chemicals and Marketing and Specialties segments.Millions of DollarsExcept as Indicated20232022*Q2Q1Jun YTDQ2Jun YTDReconciliation of Consolidated Earnings to Adjusted EarningsConsolidated Earnings$ 1,6971,9613,6583,1673,749Pre-tax adjustments:Hurricane-related costs————17Net (gain)/loss on asset disposition14(36)(22)——Alliance shutdown-related costs1———2626Regulatory compliance costs———7070Business transformation restructuring costs24135762525DCP integration restructuring costs3221234——Loss on early redemption of DCP debt53—53——Tax impact of adjustments4(22)(2)(24)(28)(32)Other tax impacts———2525Noncontrolling interests(39)(5)(44)——Adjusted earnings$ 1,7661,9653,7313,2853,880Earnings per share of common stock (dollars)$ 3.724.207.926.538.00Adjusted earnings per share of common stock (dollars)5$ 3.874.218.086.778.28Reconciliation of Segment Pre-Tax Income (Loss) to Adjusted Pre-Tax Income (Loss)Midstream Pre-Tax Income$ 6047021,306258470Pre-tax adjustments:Net gain on asset disposition—(36)(36)——DCP integration restructuring costs3221234——Adjusted pre-tax income$ 6266781,304258470Chemicals Pre-Tax Income$ 192198390273669Pre-tax adjustments:None—————Adjusted pre-tax income$ 192198390273669Refining Pre-Tax Income$ 1,1341,6082,7423,0963,269Pre-tax adjustments:Hurricane-related costs————17Net loss on asset disposition14—14——Alliance shutdown-related costs1———2626Regulatory compliance costs———7070Adjusted pre-tax income$ 1,1481,6082,7563,1923,382Marketing and Specialties Pre-Tax Income$ 6444261,0707391,035Pre-tax adjustments:None—————Adjusted pre-tax income$ 6444261,0707391,035Corporate and Other Pre-Tax Loss$ (330)(283)(613)(260)(509)Pre-tax adjustments:Business transformation restructuring costs24135762525Loss on early redemption of DCP debt53—53——Adjusted pre-tax loss$ (236)(248)(484)(235)(484)*Earnings and adjusted earnings for the second quarter of 2022 and the six-month period ended June 30,2022, have been recast to reflect a change in the composition of the company's segments made in the fourth quarter of 2022.

While light product inventories amid resilient consumption should continue to support the space, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings for the remainder of 2023.Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistent inflation continues to eat into profits. Nevertheless, the industry continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Murphy USA and PBF Energy.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.Story continues3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry???s FutureMargins Fall From 2022-Highs: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or the difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will push profitability down further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.    Substantial Recovery in Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Supply-Chain, Inflation Challenges: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198, which places it in the bottom 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has gone up 8.7% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 4.6%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 11.6%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.13X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 13.98X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.96X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.76X, as low as 1.84X, with a median of 4.24X.4 Stocks to WatchMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA's acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 60 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 7.1%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the average being 15.6%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of MUSA have gained 8.2% in a year.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.2%. Valued at around $55.9 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Marathon Petroleum has gained 42.1% in a year.Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength. The company buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.PSX beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the average being 13.5%. Valued at around $50.6 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 Phillips 66 has gained 27.4% in a year.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF's daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.PBF, based in Parsippany, NJ, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average being 18.5%. The Zacks #3 Ranked PBF's shares are up 42.3% in a year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Story continuesNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products.

Newmont, in consultation with Newcrest, has also determined that no premerger notification under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act will be required in the United States for the transaction to move forward.Newmont continues advancing other regulatory approvals and expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. Last month, the Canadian Competition Bureau issued a ""no action"" letter clearing the proposed acquisition.""We appreciate the ICCC in Papua New Guinea carefully reviewing and clearing our proposed acquisition of Newcrest,"" said Tom Palmer, President and CEO of Newmont. ""Lihir in PNG is one of the world's great gold mines and a Tier 1 operation by any measure. In addition to Lihir, we see profitable gold and copper growth through the world-class Wafi-Golpu project. We remain committed to building strong, mutually beneficial and long lasting relationships with PNG’s government and local communities. As part of this commitment, Newmont plans to establish PNG as a standalone fifth region in our portfolio with an in-country senior leadership presence and pursue a secondary listing of Newmont depositary interests on the PNGX.""Other regulatory approvals to be secured for Newmont’s proposed acquisition of Newcrest include the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australia Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC), and the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). Newmont and Newcrest also continue engaging with the PNG Government and regulators about other approvals and clearances for the proposed transaction.Story continuesOn May 14, Newmont announced its definitive agreement to acquire Newcrest. The combination would create a world-class portfolio of assets with the highest concentration of Tier 1 operations, primarily in favorable, low-risk mining jurisdictions. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company would deliver a multi-decade production profile from 10 large, long-life, low cost, Tier 1 operations, and increased annual copper production primarily from Australia and Canada. The combined business is anticipated to generate annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million, expected to be achieved within the first 24 months, while also targeting at least $2 billion in the first two years after closing through portfolio optimization.1_________________________1 See endnotes and cautionary statement for additional information.About NewmontNewmont is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.

My name is Rob, and I am your event operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to today's conference, Public Service Enterprise Group's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, August 1, 2023, and will be available for replay as an audio webcast on PSEG's Investor Relations website at investor.pseg.com.I would now like to turn the conference over to Carlotta Chan. Please go ahead.Carlotta N. ChanGood morning, and welcome to PSEG's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation. On today's call are Ralph LaRossa, Chair President and CEO; as well as Dan Cregg, Executive Vice President and CFO. The press release, attachments and slides for today's discussion are posted on our IR website at investor.pseg.com, and our 10-Q will be filed shortly.PSEG's earnings release and other matters discussed during today's call contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. We will also discuss non-GAAP operating earnings, which differs from net income or net loss as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP in the United States. We include reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures and a disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements on our IR website and in today's materials. Following Ralph and Dan's prepared remarks, we will conduct a 30-minute question-and-answer session.I will now turn the call over to Ralph LaRossa.Story continuesRalph A. LaRossaThank you, Carlotta. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us to review PSEG's second quarter results. This morning, PSEG reported second quarter 2023 net income of $1.18 per share compared to net income of $0.26 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter were $0.70 per share compared to $0.64 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP results for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022 exclude items shown in Attachments 8 and 9 provided with the earnings release.Results for the second quarter and year-to-date align with our full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share, which we reaffirmed along with our outlook for 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth through 2027 in this morning's earnings announcement. Dan will also discuss our financial results in greater detail, but this was a relatively straightforward quarter for both PSE&amp;G and PSEG Power &amp; Other results fully meeting our planning expectations and supporting full year segment guidance.We are focused on proving out the execution of our plans and grow PSEG while also increasing the predictability of our business. During the quarter, we completed PSEG's exit from offshore wind generation through the sale of our 25% equity stake in Ocean Wind 1 back to Ørsted, recovering our investment in the project. We also continue to implement the solutions we outlined to address pension variability. PSEG recently executed an agreement for a pension lift-out to further reduce prospective earnings variability. This transaction covers approximately 2,000 retirees and will transfer approximately $1 billion of related obligations and associated plan assets to the insurer.The transaction expected to be completed this month will result in no changes to the amount of benefits payable for the retirees and have no material impact on PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings in 2023. Turning now to PSEG's capital spending plans. The utility portion of $15.5 billion to $18 billion remains focused on system modernization of our aging distribution infrastructure, Last Mile support in preparation for EV and building electrification, climate mitigation aligned with New Jersey's energy policies and our clean energy investments.PSE&amp;G's investment program drives our expected compound annual growth rate and rate base of 6% to 7.5% from year-end 2022 to year-end 2027. The low end of this rate base CAGR assumes an extension of our gas system modernization program and our clean energy investments at their current average annual levels. While the upper end includes an extension of our Energy Strong II program, which is scheduled to conclude in 2024 as well as the remaining portion of our proposal for medium- and heavy-duty EVs and energy storage programs as well as a potentially higher amount of investment for GSMP and energy efficiency above current levels.With this robust capital program, we are ever mindful of customers' affordability. And on this front, PSE&amp;G continues to compare well to peers on a share of wallet basis, both in the region as well as nationally. I mentioned in the last quarter that our 2023 utility capital spending budget of $3.5 billion was the largest single year plan in our history. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $900 million, bringing us to $1.7 billion year-to-date and midyear.We are on schedule and on budget. In fact, PSE&amp;G just installed its 1 million smart meters out of 2.3 million that we have planned, and we continue to notice higher spend on electric -- new business related to electric vehicles and strong demand for our energy efficiency solutions. Speaking of energy efficiency, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities recently approved its second energy efficiency framework for the next 3-year cycle that will begin in July of 2024 and run through June of 2027.This past May, the BPU approved a $280 million 9-month extension of PSEG's first energy efficiency program to sync us up with the completion of the state's first cycle in June of 2024. You may recall that PSE&amp;G started its energy efficiency programs earlier than the other New Jersey utilities bid.The BPU's new framework sets up guidelines for the next round of energy efficiency plans, which are now due this October for implementation in July of 2024. The energy efficiency annual reduction goals of 0.75% for gas and 2% for electric for program years '26 and '27 remain unchanged. The BPU also approved the performance incentive mechanism to drive energy efficiency above the preset goals.On the gas side of the utility, PSE&amp;G filed the third phase of its gas system modernization program during the first quarter of 2023, which remains pending with the BPU. Through our gas system monetization program, we reduced methane release by approximately 22% system-wide. And assuming the extension at similar to current levels, we expect to achieve an overall reduction in methane emissions of at least 60% over the 2011 to 2030 period. There is also good news for customer bills for this coming winter.Following 2 basic gas supply service commodity charge reductions this past heating season, our recently filed BGSS rate proposes a reduction from $0.47 to $0.40 per therm. If approved by the BPU, the new rate will keep PSE&amp;G's monthly bill for typical residential gas customers among the lowest in the region for the upcoming 2024 heating season. The BPU's future of natural gas stakeholder proceeding will also start this month, and we expect to participate in the upcoming technical conference and on follow-up meetings as New Jersey achieves its emission reduction targets, which will also will be considering the impact on costs and jobs.Kim Hanemann, President of PSE&amp;G is already actively involved in the state's clean buildings working group that is considering various approaches to building electrification, including the development of Clean Heat Standard. Our overall approach to energy transition is to continue advocating for practical expansion of electrification in a manner which protects customer affordability, safety and reliability. We are having impactful conversations with PJM, our regional grid operator and our New Jersey stakeholders to increase the coordination and understanding of our relative perspectives on future load growth and the investment needed in existing T&amp;D infrastructure to meet even a diluted version of New Jersey energy transition.Now turning to nuclear operations. The PSEG nuclear fleet continues to safely generate the majority of New Jersey's carbon-free baseload electricity. During the first half of 2023, our nuclear units generated over 16 terawatt hours of electricity and operated at capacity factor of 95.8%. Charles McFeaters, who many of you met at our March investor conference, was promoted to Chief Nuclear Officer during the quarter in a seamless and well-planned transition that included the Salem 2 refueling outage completed on schedule and on budget.The Power &amp; other portion of PSEG's 5-year capital program is a significantly smaller amount of PSEG's total, mainly reflecting basic nuclear capital spending, but does include several low-cost, high-impact projects like the Hope Creek transition from 18 months to 24-month refueling cycles.So just to wrap up what I believe is a quarter that delivers on what we have committed to you, we are reiterating our full year non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Second, we continue to make progress on building our earnings growth platform by keeping our largest-ever capital program on track, financed with a strong balance sheet without the need for new equity or asset sales through 2027. And this financial strength gives us confidence in our long-term 5% to 7% growth rate in non-GAAP operating earnings through 2027 and supports our ability to pay a competitive and growing dividend, as we have for 116 years.Third, we increased the predictability of our financial results by streamlining the business with the completed offshore wind sale and delivering progress on reducing pension variability with the lift-out. Finally, we are working to keep our customer bills affordable during the energy transition with help from stringent cost controls and a culture of continuous improvement. Moving out the execution of our strategy and maintaining a safe and reliable network operations, that is what you can expect from this team.I'll now turn the call over to Dan for more details on the operating results, and I will be available for your questions after his remarks.Daniel J. CreggGreat. Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everybody. Earlier, Ralph mentioned that PSEG reported net income of $591 million or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share for the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the second quarter of 2023 were $351 million or $0.70 per share compared to $320 million or $0.64 per share for the second quarter of 2022.We've provided you with information on Slides 9 and 11 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings per share by business for the second quarter and year-to-date periods and Slides 10 and 12 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes for the quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date periods in non-GAAP operating earnings per share by major business.Starting with PSE&amp;G, which reported second quarter 2023 net income of $336 million or $0.67 per share. This compares to $305 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings were $341 million or $0.68 per share compared to $305 million or $0.61 per share in the second quarter of 2022. The main drivers for both GAAP and non-GAAP results for the quarter were growth in rate base reflected in higher transmission formula rate, recovery of infrastructure investments with roll-in mechanisms and a benefit from the reversal and timing of taxes, which we mentioned on the first quarter call, nets to 0 over the course of the year.These favorable items were partly offset by our anticipated lower pension income and OPEB credits, along with higher depreciation and interest expense from increased investment versus the year earlier quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, transmission was $0.02 per share higher, gas margin was $0.01 per share higher driven by the clause recovery of GSMP investment. Electric margin was $0.01 per share higher, reflecting investment returns from Energy Strong and other electric and gas margin added $0.02 per share based on a benefit from the tax adjustment credit and appliance service results.Lower distribution O&amp;M expense added $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily reflecting reduced weather-related corrective maintenance. Depreciation and interest expense increased by $0.01 and $0.02 per share, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting continued growth in investment. Lower pension income resulting from 2022's investment returns, combined with lower OPEB credits scheduled to end in 2023, resulted in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison to the year earlier quarter.Lastly, the timing of taxes recorded through an effective tax rate, which nets to 0 over a full year and other flow-through taxes had a net favorable impact of $0.06 per share in the quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter weather typically contains both heating and cooling sales. For 2023, winter weather during the second quarter was 23% warmer in terms of heating degree days than the second quarter of 2022, and summer weather was 34% cooler than second quarter 2022 as measured by the temperature humidity index.As we've mentioned, the SIP mechanism in effect since 2021, limits the impact of weather and other sales variances, positive or negative on electric and gas margins while importantly, enabling PSE&amp;G to promote the widespread adoption of its energy efficiency programs. Growth in the number of electric and gas customers, the driver of margin under the SIP mechanism continues to be positive and were each up 1% during the trailing 12-month period.On capital spending, PSE&amp;G invested $900 million during the second quarter and is on plan to deliver its largest annual capital investment program at $3.5 billion. The program includes upgrades to our T&amp;D facilities, Energy Strong II investments, last mile spend in the infrastructure advancement program and the continued rollout of the clean energy investments in energy efficiency and the Energy Cloud, including smart meters.Related to our pension, in February 2023, the BPU approved an accounting order authorizing PSE&amp;G to modify its method for calculating the amortization of the net actuarial gain or loss component for ratemaking purposes. This change is effective for the calendar year ending December 31, 2023 and forward. For the full year 2023, PSE&amp;G's forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings is unchanged at $1.500 billion to $1.525 billion.Moving on to Power &amp; Other. Just as a reminder, Power &amp; Other includes our nuclear fleet, gas operations, Long Island and parent activities, including interest expense. For the second quarter of 2023, PSEG Power &amp; Other reported net income of $255 million or $0.51 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $10 million or $0.02 per share. This compares to second quarter 2022 net loss of $174 million or $0.35 per share and non-GAAP operating earnings of $15 million or $0.03 per share.We previously mentioned that during the first quarter of 2023, PSEG Power realized the majority of the approximate $4 per megawatt hour increase in the average price of our 2023 hedged output, which rose to approximately $31 per megawatt hour with higher winter pricing driving most of the increase. For the second quarter of 2023, gross margin rose by a total of $0.05 per share reflecting the absence of certain full requirement BGS load contracts that remain following the sale of the fossil business in 2022 and resulted in a lower cost to serve compared to the prior year.The increase in gross margin includes higher generation of $0.01 per share from fewer refueling outage days in the second quarter of 2023, offset by lower capacity revenues of $0.01 per share compared to the year ago quarter. O&amp;M cost comparisons in the second quarter improved by $0.01 per share in 2023. Higher interest expense covering PSEG Power and parent financings were $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the year ago quarter from higher variable rates on term loans and refinancing maturing debt at higher rates. Lower pension income from 2022 investment returns and OPEB credits from the lower amortization benefit mentioned earlier were $0.03 per share unfavorable versus the second quarter of 2022.And taxes and other were $0.02 per share unfavorable compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting a partial reversal of the effective tax rate benefit from the first quarter and lower investment income.On the operating side, the nuclear fleet produced approximately 7.7 terawatt hours during the second quarter and 16 terawatt hours for the year-to-date period in 2023, running at a capacity factor of 91.2% for the quarter and 95.8% for the year-to-date period. For the full year 2023, PSEG is forecasting generation output of 30 to 32 terawatt hours and has hedged approximately 95% to 100% of this production at an average price of $31 per megawatt hour.For 2024, the nuclear fleet is forecasted to produce 30 to 32 terawatt hours of baseload output and has hedged 75% to 80% of this generation at an average price of $38 per megawatt hour. The forecast of non-GAAP operating earnings for PSEG Power and other is unchanged at $200 million to $225 million for the full year. This forecast reflects the realization of a majority of the expected increase in the average 2023 annual hedge price in the first quarter of '23, as we previously discussed.Touching on some recent financing activity. As of June 30, 2023, PSEG had total available liquidity of $4 billion, including $500 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of approximately $400 million at June 30, which is well below the levels experienced during 2022. Through the second quarter, we've repaid $2 billion of term loans, which were entered into during 2022 to support our collateral needs.In April, we entered into a $750 million 364-day variable rate term loan to support our liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2023, PSEG had $750 million outstanding of a 364-day variable rate term loan and PSEG Power had $1.25 billion outstanding of a variable rate term loan maturing March of 2025. As of the end of the quarter, PSEG had swapped $900 million of the power term loan from a variable rate to a fixed rate.And in May, PSE&amp;G paid at maturity $500 million of secured medium-term notes. As Ralph mentioned earlier, PSEG recently executed an agreement for a pension lift-out that will further increase the predictability of our financial results. This transaction covers approximately 2,000 retirees from PSEG Power &amp; Other, and will transfer approximately $1 billion of related obligations and associated plan assets. This transaction will have no material impact on PSEG's non-GAAP operating earnings in 2023.Upon completion of the pension lift-out, we anticipate taking a onetime noncash settlement charge in the third quarter of 2023 related to the immediate recognition of unamortized net actuarial loss associated with a portion of the pension involved in the transaction. After providing for the effect of this transaction, our pension plans remain well funded.As Ralph mentioned, we are reaffirming PSEG's full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.40 to $3.50 per share, with PSE&amp;G forecasted to contribute between $1.500 billion to $1.525 billion and PSEG Power &amp; Other forecasted at $200 million to $225 million.The settlement charge related to the lift-out is not included in the full year 2023 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for PSEG, PSE&amp;G or PSEG Power &amp; Other. That concludes our formal remarks. And operator, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Shahriar PourrezaDan, you talked about some uncertainties remaining with power and energy prices until we get that PTC guidance. Any update on conversations with treasury? There seems to be some delays, obviously, in other tax credit issues. So does that potentially push out like the PTC implementation. And does that change the calculus for power as you think about earnings hedging in any of the efficiency projects like refueling gas, et cetera.Daniel J. CreggYes. Thanks, Shahriar. I don't think it changes much for us. I think maybe an analogy, 2023, the corporate minimum tax kicks in, and there's still guidance that we're looking for that as well. So I think from a PTC perspective, it's a tax credit -- it applies under the existing law. It states it begins 1/1/2024. So I've heard nothing from the standpoint of any delay in implementation. I think what we may have the potential for is, we may not know on the 1st of January exactly how they will define gross receipts.If I think about it, technically that tax return will get filed until into '25. I still would love to have the information now to best plan what we do. But I don't think there's any question, nothing that I've heard of anyway that would tell you that the start date would be anything other than 1/1/2024, but I have also not heard anything with respect to the date with which we will get further guidance on (inaudible).Shahriar PourrezaAnd then just on the '24 case expectations, I mean, you guys have highlighted the need to recover base spending that's not in much mechanisms to the tune of $0.30 earnings in '25. As we're getting closer to a filing, can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should think about the revenue deficiency and the overall rate impact as we are seeing higher cost of capital? It's certainly a different inflationary environment in the last (inaudible).Daniel J. CreggYes, I don't think I would think about it any differently than we talked about it before, right? The filing date for the rate case remains fourth quarter. I think the nature of the capital that we still have in front of us to roll in all remains the same as what we've talked about before. And so it will be a part of the filing that we'll make. And again, most of that are items that we've been through proceedings with the BPU, whether it's stipulated base or whether it's some of the clauses that we've actually set up a deferral mechanism for those roll-ins.So I don't think that we're in a different place from that approach and where we'll go. I think we're just kind of moving forward in getting that filing ready to be submitted in the fourth quarter.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect, very clear-cut quarter. So that's all I had.OperatorThe next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.Jeremy Bryan TonetJust wanted to get into the pension lift a little bit more. Just wondering if you could provide some more details such as is there any cash changing hands here? And how does the equity fixed income mix and the lifted out portion compare to the rest? And any thoughts on the equity fixed income mix going forward with the strength in equity markets?Ralph A. LaRossaYes. So Jeremy, I'm going to have Dan give you some details and I will discuss much on the PIC or pension investment committee plans. But I just wanted to kind of preface it by saying a couple of things. One, really proud of the work that the entire team here did at PSEG. I mean there's a lot of hard work and we talked about this pension lift-out not too long ago and got to the point where we executed on it in a very timely manner.So just really happy with the work that they did. Really happy about the way that we were able to protect our retirees and the folks that have done so much for us over the years in the way that we transacted here and fill a lot of details, and we'll get out to those folks. But -- very happy about that part of this process as well and certainly happy about the results that we were able to achieve, which Dan will go into a little more detail here, but it's more and more of the execution that we've talked about and trying to build that confidence for you all that you expected from us.Daniel J. CreggYes. So Jeremy, to your more particular questions. So your first question about cash transacted. By its very nature of what the transaction is, is a liability for future pension payments that will move out of the company and that liability will be matched basically with cash that's going to go out with it. And so yes, there is a cash element to the transaction.However, you should think about that cash as coming out of the pension trust where those liabilities will be paid from. And so from more general corporate cash, don't think about any cash from that perspective solely from the trust. That said, and I think that is very a logical way to think about it, given your second question, which is where does that cash come from? And so we have investments across a bunch of different elements of spectrums of investments that we have made through different managers in the pension trust.And I think just the most natural way to think about it without putting too fine a point on it is, it's roughly 20% of the pension, and you could think of us as essentially taking about 20% of our investments across the board and moving them over. There's -- that won't be a perfect interpretation but pretty close to how to think about what it would look like on a go-forward basis from the remaining mix within the funds. So I think that's a simple way to think about it, but an appropriate way to think about it.Jeremy Bryan TonetGot it. That's very helpful. And then thinking about the pension lift-out here and thinking about kind of 5% to 7% growth CAGR. As previously communicated, is there any impact that we should think about here from this transaction?Daniel J. CreggNo, you should not -- I think the 5% to 7% you should think about as being intact. Really, Jeremy, this was all about looking to the potential variability and results that we could see corporately because of the size of the pension. And that was the driver behind the transaction. Ralph made a hugely important point. We've said all along, the first thing that we needed to do with our diligence wasn't sure that this was going to be a move that would protect the benefit to our retirees. We did significant diligence there, I felt very comfortable there.And then secondarily, it needed to ultimately come through in a way that made sense for the company as well. And so that's exactly what we did. I think that managing that variability going forward is what we have talked about for a while and what we wanted to deliver on. And you could see some very, very de minimis effects as we step forward within the plan, but nothing that's going to move us out of that range at all.OperatorThe next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.David Keith ArcaroQuick follow-up on the lift-out. What does that leave you in terms of a funding ratio post the transfer there?Daniel J. CreggYes. So we finished the year at 87% and the year has been pretty good as we work through. So you can kind of think about that as increasing into the low 90s. And so we're in a good position from a funding perspective with what remains still within that kind of a range as we go forward from here.David Keith ArcaroOkay. Got it. Perfect. And then on the Hope Creek fuel cycle extension, is that kicking off earlier here than you had anticipated previously? Or is that still on track toward the potential fall 2025 outage that you had mentioned previously in the Investor Day?Ralph A. LaRossaYes, 2 separate -- so good pickup, David, definitely on track for that date that we talked about in the Investment Day. But the work starts earlier, right, because it's just a lot of engineering work that needs to be done because some of those -- some of that fabrication starts years in advance. So the engineering is taking place and kicked off. We have a good idea, the costs are minimal as we had explained, and it's on target for that date that we had said. So again, more execution from the team down there.David Keith ArcaroYes. Great. And then just one other minor question related to that, just as a follow-on. Are you -- how are you thinking about hydrogen and the prospects of potentially producing hydrogen at your nuclear facilities. Do you have involvement or any perspective on the discussions going on now in terms of framing up that policy structure and how additionality might be considered. Just wondering if that's front of mind for you.Ralph A. LaRossaNo, it's not top of mind because it's not a big driver for us one way or the other, but it's something we certainly want to do for a couple of reasons. I mean one, it's the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, if we can help on the hydrogen development front. So that's one piece of it. Two, it's good for the region economically for New Jersey in the southern part of the state down there. If we could get some activities, additional construction activity, more jobs that southern area around our Salem plant has been challenged economically over the years. So another positive from that aspect. And then from the third, look, it is going to have some incremental financial impacts for us. I think additionality might make a lot of sense. But again, I think we're a small player in that, and we'll see where policymakers go with it.OperatorNext question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraJust I want to go back to the pension lift-out real quick, Dan, congrats for getting it done in short order here. Just if memory serves me right, the portion of the pension, which is not covered by rates, or on the regulatory side was around 30%, and this lift-out is for 20%. So I'm just wondering if -- what are you doing with the 10% that is not covered by rates? Just any thoughts there.Daniel J. CreggYes, your order magnitude is right there, Durgesh. And essentially, the transaction and the go-forward pension plans would have been more complicated to do this kind of a transaction with active employees because you kind of got a moving target, right? Your service cost continues to go forward. And those kind of elements come into play. And so right now, just think about what sits outside of this lift-out in Power &amp; other as just being status quo.Durgesh ChopraGot it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just any thoughts on potential for a settlement in the GSMP filing. You've had a nice track record here. Energy efficiency was a very constructive outcome. So any color you can share there?Ralph A. LaRossaDurgesh, I'll give you a couple of pieces. Yes, last night was the first public hearing that we had on the GSMP filing. 17 individuals spoke in favor of the filing, 1 against. So just in sheer numbers and conversation, it was a very positive outcome. 4 public officials spoke in favor of the project and the work that's been done so far by our folks out in the field. So really, really positive there. So I'm very optimistic that public sentiment is in the right direction. That should all lead to a continuation of our opportunity to settle. I would be surprised if we were in a situation that was anything about a settlement when we get to the end of this.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.Carly S. DavenportMaybe just to start, as you think about the regulatory environment in New Jersey, a couple of new commissioners have joined the commission there. Anything that you would highlight in terms of changes or expectations around the regulatory landscape there following the personnel additions?Ralph A. LaRossaYes. No, nothing that I would expect to change dramatically. Look, we've got some real good conversations that are going on. From what I can tell and what folks have had going from conversations would be aligned with the things that new commissioners are talking about, focus on environmental issues, focus on affordability. I think what we're doing on the GSMP program is completely aligned from that standpoint, especially with our -- with the methane reductions that are involved there and the work that we're doing, getting those pipes ready for whatever they may carry down the road.The electrification work is certainly aligned with comments that those new commissioners have made in other settings before they were in the commission. So I think that's a real good sign. And from an affordability standpoint, boy, I got to tell you, the more we dig into this in preparation for our upcoming rate case, the prouder I am of what New Jersey has done over the years. I mean we -- no matter which way you look at it, the rate increases for the entire state -- I'm not just talking about us, but for the entire state have really stayed below inflation rates.And with all the work that we're doing to electrify homes, electrify transportation and clean up the grid, it has really proved out in New Jersey that we can -- if you do it right, you can do it in an affordable way, and the numbers are proving that out. So I think everything we're doing is aligned with what those 2 new commissioners would expect and things that they have said in prior positions that they've held.Carly S. DavenportGreat. That's helpful. And then just on collateral postings, it looks like that was down to about $400 million at quarter end. Any thoughts on how we should think about the cadence of incremental hedges rolling off from here?Daniel J. CreggYes, Carly, I think if you think about us continuing to do what we've historically done it's probably the right answer. And maybe just for a little bit of a different reason, I answered the question earlier on the PTC timing and -- that Shahriar had asked. And we are still waiting, but we've also thought through what some of those potential outcomes could be from the treasury regs and we're taking into account, admittedly a little bit in the dark what they could look like as we're continuing to move forward.So I think until we know something different, I'd say it's an educated thought process, but maybe not as educated as we like with the guidance that we have and thinking about what to do. But we are layering on some incremental hedges as we go through time. I think you've seen within the material today over the last quarter, you've seen a little bit more and a little bit of a higher price. So we're just trying to be smart about it in a situation where we don't know everything we'd like to know. But hopefully, we'll get some information soon from treasury.OperatorNext question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithI just wanted to follow up on a few things that have been said here. First off, coming back to that pension lift-out, I just wanted to run this by you guys. Just with the $1 billion implying return on asset flipping the liability around conversely. I mean it sounds like that might be like maybe upwards of a nickel drag here. Again, it's difficult from the outside to run the math. But does that sound like ballpark? Is it a drag? Is there sort of a net drag on a run rate '24 basis, if you will? Or are there other offsets here to think about? Just to close out on that one.Ralph A. LaRossaYes. No, Julien, listen, I don't think those numbers you just quoted would be aligned with the words de minimis. So I think that would be a little bit more than what we would certainly expect and not aligned with what our expectations are.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. I appreciate it. And then separately, look, did I just hear you say additionality might make sense on the nuclear side? I just wanted you to -- if you might clarify your thoughts around that.Ralph A. LaRossaNo, I could understand why people would make that argument. So it might make sense in some circles to do that, right? It certainly would make the most sense from a -- if you just want to generate hydrogen and create hydrogen from the nuclear plants, but I could understand why people make that argument from a tax credit standpoint, right?Because if you're getting tax credits for providing clean energy into the grid and then you convert that to hydrogen, then you get both tax credits. And I could understand that, right? Just the legitimate argument to make. So is that something we're taking a position on one way or the other, but I could certainly understand why some people would approach it that way.And I could understand why other people would approach it, ""Hey, listen, we really have to kick start the hydrogen generation. And so therefore, we want to see that -- we want to see all those tax credits go to that angle. I think that's a -- it's a real policy call. It's -- some folks are going to need to make within Washington. So we'll see where it goes.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. All right. Excellent. And then just meanwhile, I mean, if not going down the hydrogen route, I mean, how do you think about parallel avenues of data centers or what have you, just to maximize your opportunity set around these nuclear plants. Obviously, we've seen some of your peers out there maximizing around some of these low carbon transactions, if you will.Ralph A. LaRossaYes. So again, I think what Dan has been saying from the beginning, and I'm just going to reinforce here is, we really need to understand what treasury is going to seem to be the revenues. And once we understand that, then we can optimize that for our shareholders. Everything that I've been saying up to this point is just respectful of the conversation that's been taking place. It's not meant to take sides on anything.So even whether it's data centers and I -- we try to do what's right for New Jersey and New Jersey customers. And so, hey, does that make sense? Is it a data center here? Where is that data center? Are we wheel in power. There's all sorts of things that are going to go into our thought process as we go forward. And the number one is what Dan has been saying, let's see what rule of treasury say as to how revenue is going to be calculated.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithRight. Got it. But the point is you'll come up with a -- or you could come up with a new strategy pro forma for wherever the IRS lands on some of these regs. Can we get an update from you.Ralph A. LaRossaYes, 100%. And -- but again, give us a week to digest the rules when they come out, and then we'll have a plan ready. We're -- those conversations are not -- they're already -- we're already looking at things inside. We'll figure it out.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithGot it. You're already working on things pro forma here with folks?Ralph A. LaRossaAlways. That's why we're able to move as fast than we did on pension. Yes.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.Paul PattersonSo just -- almost all my questions have been answered. But just on -- I apologize for missing this. What is the expected GAAP impact of the lift-out?Carlotta N. ChanGAAP. GAAP.Daniel J. CreggYes. So Paul, what we said is both -- as we look at 2023, de minimis impact, not even worth kind of including within any models, very, very small impact anticipated. And then going forward, I'd say the same, right? There's a very modest positive arbitrage. But by the same token, what we're -- what we've also talked about here is we will see a onetime charge come through from the standpoint of the unrecognized element. And so the absence of that going forward does provide somewhat of an offset. So I would not think about it as having much of an impact, '23 or going forward. So the main tracker that we talk about is mitigating the volatility.Paul PattersonOkay. But the charge itself is not going to be big either, is what you're saying?Daniel J. CreggNo, that 1 charge -- so if you take a look at our year-end 2022, that unamortized amount was about $2 billion. So we've disclosed that we would see something in the low 200s after tax from the standpoint that was in the release of the amortization of that charge. So think about the pension as a whole, having that unamortized balance. And if this is about a 20% impact you're seeing about that coming through on the onetime charge.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities.Anthony Christopher CrowdellYou may have addressed this in Durgesh's question, so I apologize. But if we think about from year-end to now, you had the approval from the BPU on the pension smoothing and now the lift-out. How much of your pension volatility have you reduced or removed from the end of 2022?Daniel J. CreggA little less than half, somewhere between 40% and 50%.Anthony Christopher CrowdellOkay. And then I appreciate you did go through that this is for the PEG Power employees unregulated. And in the fourth quarter, you're going to file the general rate case where I believe you're going to request a pension tracker. If the company is unsuccessful or the regulators do not approve the pension tracker, I mean, is this an option that you would look deeper into for the regulated employees? Or just structurally, it just makes -- it's very hard to do it for existing employees, this type of lift-out?Ralph A. LaRossaYes, Anthony. So we will absolutely have a conversation with the BPU about a mechanism to address pensions and the volatility around that. So -- they worked with us on the last mechanism. They worked with other companies. So we'll be in there having a conversation about it. It's good for ratepayers as well as also it create -- it reduces their volatility as well over a longer period of time as you are going from rate. So it makes sense for everyone.That said, we always will continue to take a look at things like we just executed on. But I would tell you that it's really tough to figure out for active employees what the right formula is for all the reasons that Dan mentioned, I think it was to Durgesh earlier, how long is somebody going to work? What's going to be their earnings trajectory and so on and so forth. So I think those pieces of the puzzle make it tougher when you have a group of employees like we just went through, it was a lot easier to have that conversation. And again, got us in a really good place.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.Ryan Michael LevineGiven the range of gross receipt treatment outcomes from treasury, what's the range of '24 hedges that you'd be considering adding on to your nuclear plate?Daniel J. CreggYes, I think, Ryan, it's a tough question to answer, given that we don't have what we need to have from treasury. We have been stepping into hedges as we've approached the year fairly similar to what we've done in the past to be as prepared to mitigate the market volatility as we can. And so I think the question is going to be best answered when we do have that guidance and as we continue to go through the rest of the year.Ryan Michael LevineJust a follow-up on that. I mean when I look back on where you were last year at this time from a hedge standpoint and you were meaningfully more hedged on a 1-year forward basis than you are today. Given that comment, what's driving the lower hedge profile?Daniel J. CreggWell -- and Ryan, the other thing I would add to that is we've said in the past that we've tended to work our way through a 3-year period within a range kind of a band of hedges across those 3 years. And so there are periods of time where we will try to take a look at what the market looks like within that range to take advantage of market opportunities. And so if you just think about where we've been historically from a price point perspective and where we are now, I think the opportunities led us to be a little bit higher within that band before and a little bit lower within that band compared to last year right now.Ralph A. LaRossaWhich at the end of the day is exactly the way Dan has managed this for years, and the team has managed it for years and they've looked for those opportunities. So absent really clear guidance from treasury, we're doing what we've done in the past.Ryan Michael LevineInteresting topics. How does the recently approved second energy efficiency framework impact the company's approach to energy efficiency into the next filing later this year?Ralph A. LaRossaYes. I don't think it impacted what's going to happen in the next filing. What really impact -- will impact what's going to happen in the next filing is what was just released by the Board of Public Utilities, which is their triennial report or direction that was an order that came out on energy efficiency. And we're still studying that, but that has a lot of upside for us there that we think will really encourage additional energy efficiency investments from companies like ours. So more to come on that, but that I would encourage you to take a hard look at that order because I think it really did provide a good road map for all the utilities in New Jersey to follow and provide some opportunity for us.Carlotta N. ChanRob, we'll take 1 last call and then we'll turn it back to Ralph for closing comments.OperatorThank you. That last call will come from Paul Freeman with Ladenburg Thalmann.Unidentified AnalystQuick question on generation gross margin year-to-date and how we should think about generation gross margin for your following your hedges?Daniel J. CreggYes. I think as you take a look year-to-date, one of the things we talked about upfront was the hedge price we saw most of that uplift within the first quarter. So we got more of the benefit from the timing of the hedges that were put on during the winter period. I think what you're more likely to see as you go through the balance of the year is a little bit of a change from the standpoint of looking back at '22 when we kind of rolled off our final load-serving contracts compared to where we are now without them is that we have a little bit higher cost to serve last year compared to what we're seeing this year because of those contracts.And so most of the top-line benefit has been recognized year-over-year if you take a look at where the hedge prices are, but the cost to serve will benefit as we go through the balance of the year, Paul.Unidentified AnalystSo if I look at next year, you would expect the gross margin to be roughly comparable in terms of how it's calculated or the differential to the hedge price as it is this year?Daniel J. CreggNo, we'll give you guidance next year for next year's results as we head in there. But I think next year, you're also going to have a situation where you'll have PTCs in place that will change things. So it's a more complicated structure that we can talk through as we go forward and to give next year's guidance.OperatorI would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. LaRossa for closing comments.Ralph A. LaRossaThank you. So I would just leave everyone with this. For the -- as we kind of put this new management team in place and talked about things, we said we weren't going to change much. We were going to continue our strategy. But I think this quarter kind of reinforced a lot of things that we've been telling you over the first 6 months here.Alignment with public policy, especially in the state of New Jersey is really important and the great work from the workforce that we have and our alignment with them on a regular basis. And the reason for that is that we were able to execute the way we did. 3 big wins, I'd say this quarter, our exit from offshore wind done in a way that really, I would say, we're very, very proud of. We entered. We took a hard look at that opportunity, and we exited in a way that both -- we were able to keep our heads up financially, policy-wise and with our -- with the labor workforce in the state of New Jersey as we did that.Second, we stayed aligned with public policy on our energy efficiency filing and took a good step forward. But as a result of that, we'll really be able to take some advantage of some new orders that came out from the Board that we just talked about. So again, really aligned with policy and a workforce that can deliver on that.Third piece was what we just talked about on the pension execution and the work that was done there. And again, I just want to reinforce how happy we are that we were able to accomplish all the things that we set out to accomplish through some great, great teamwork from a number of folks here on our team.And then I don't want to lose sight of the heat storm that we just had here in New Jersey. And the work that was done, again, by -- if I had a number of folks that have stepped up time and time again, whether it's our appliance service technicians out fixing air conditioners that have gone bad to our overhead line workers, making sure that the pole-top transformers are back in service and the underground folks making sure the networks here in Newark and other cities are up and running and the call takers answering any questions customers might have as far as timing of restoration for the few that did go out of power.It was just great work and really was seamless. And I -- it did identify some additional opportunities for us in that last mile, which we're going to learn from and continue to put into our plans, but I can't say enough about execution on that -- on the heat storm, but execution across the board on all the things that we've accomplished in the last quarter.

This compares to earnings of $0.64 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.75%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. Would post earnings of $1.21 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.39, delivering a surprise of 14.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.PSEG , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $2.42 billion for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 19.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.08 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.PSEG shares have added about 3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.5%.What's Next for PSEG?While PSEG has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for PSEG: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.81 on $2.46 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.45 on $10.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Ameren (AEE), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 2.This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.5%.

The bottom line surpassed estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, missed in two and met in the other. The company delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.23% in the same time frame.Shares of ZTS have gained 28.3% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s 0.6% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet's see how things might have shaped up in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Factors to ConsiderThe veterinary drugmaker derives most of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. Zoetis’ remaining revenues are derived from its non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritional and agribusiness, and products and services in biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health.The company reports business results under two geographical operating segments — the United States and International.Second-quarter revenues in the United States segment are likely to have increased from the previous quarter. based on increasing sales of livestock products and new approvals. The top-line estimate for this segment is pegged at $1.17 billion.Revenues from the International segment too have likely increased in the second quarter. The top-line estimate for this segment is pinned at $980 million.Improved sales of Apoquel and Cytopoint brands must have boosted the dermatology portfolio in the second quarter. In June 2023, the FDA approved Apoquel Chewable tablets in the United States for controlling pruritus related to allergic dermatitis and control of atopic dermatitis in dogs at least 12 months of age. Apoquel chewable marks the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs in the United States. This is likely to have increased sales of the product in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesZoetis’ livestock products sales witnessed a 15% rise in the United States, in the last quarter due to an increase in cattle products sales as a result of improved product supply and growth across the beef implant portfolio. This is expected to have increased sales of livestock products in the to-be-reported quarter.However, ZTS’ Companion Animal business suffered a decline in revenues in the previous quarter, owing to distributor de-stocking across the portfolio and higher purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022, ahead of expected price increases, in the United States. In the International segment, the Companion Animal business witnessed growth, fueled by its products, Librela, Solensia and the Simparica Trio. This trend is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.Early in May, Zoetis announced FDA approval for Librela, one of its mAb therapies, to control pain associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. The injection is the first and only injectable monoclonal antibody treatment for canine OA pain approved in the United States. This is expected to have contributed to the sales of the product in the second quarter.Sales of poultry products in both geographic segments gained on the back of increased sales of vaccines despite a challenging economic condition in the United States and market expansion in several key geographies internationally.

This compares to earnings of $0.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -7.41%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this utility would post earnings of $1.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.51, delivering a surprise of 4.14%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Unitil , which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, posted revenues of $103.4 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.40%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $98.9 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Unitil shares have added about 1.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.5%.What's Next for Unitil?While Unitil has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Unitil: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.06 on $118 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.78 on $595 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Utility - Electric Power is currently in the top 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, NRG Energy (NRG), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 8.This power company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +224.2%.

The report presents the diverse viewpoints expressed by the 350 participants from industry, government and civil society designed to unearth lessons from the recent energy crisis, which has had a profound impact on energy policies and energy transition priorities around the world.Hosted by Joseph McMonigle, IEF Secretary General, and Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of S&amp;P Global, the dialogues revealed a growing consensus that expectations of a linear transition of the energy system that adheres to a single net-zero path globally are not sufficient. Instead, a ""multidimensional"" approach is required, one that is inclusive of different situations in different parts of the world; reflects varied starting points and diversity of policy approaches; and is equitable, according to the report.""A series of shocks, crises and tensions in the global energy system have rendered the energy transition more complex as climate goals coexist with energy security, energy access and affordability and other priorities,"" said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman, S&amp;P Global and author of The New Map. ""Transitioning a $100 trillion global economy in a quarter century is a big challenge. This project seeks to respond to the challenge by capturing a wide spectrum of perspectives on the energy transition and what will be required to achieve it.""Story continuesReflecting concerns expressed by the roundtable participants, the report said that ""focusing on a singular pathway to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 could undermine achievement of other sustainable development objectives, constrain financing for critical energy projects and put at risk the necessary public support for climate policies.""The recent crisis in global energy markets and high energy prices have contributed to inflation. At the same time, global GHG emissions have reached new highs as economics and shortages forced many countries to pivot back to coal-fired power generation. Growth in renewable power has accelerated but has so far failed to keep pace with growing power demand.""Developments over the last two years demonstrate that the energy transition is more complicated than has been previously thought. While the transition proceeds, expectations of a linear global transition have been shaken as climate goals compete with priorities around energy security, energy access and affordability,"" the report said.The report noted significant policy moves in developed markets, with hundreds of billions of dollars of new funding and incentives expected to cut emissions in the United States, Europe, Japan and China and drive research into new decarbonization technologies, as well as expanding market share for electric cars. At the same time, participants in the roundtables noted that progress was uneven around the world.""The path to net-zero will have to travel via the Global South and therefore it is in everyone's interest to collaborate and cooperate for the shared goals to achieve net-zero,"" it said.Developing countries, which assert that they have little responsibility for the historical accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere, are expected to drive growth in energy demand for the next 30 years, the report said.Participants from the developing countries of the Global South argued that ""depending on their access to energy resources both indigenous and imported, financing needs and geography, many of these countries need access to hydrocarbons to raise their standard of living before their emission trajectories change.""There was much discussion in the roundtables about investment needs. Some roundtable participants observed that funding bans on areas of energy production raise the cost of energy, impede economic growth and threaten to undermine public support for the transition when competitive alternative energy sources are not yet available.""Although there is broad consensus on the need to reduce emissions, the dialogues that informed this report revealed that many in the Global South feel their voices have not been heard in the global climate discussions,"" said Atul Arya, Chief Energy Strategist, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights. ""No primary energy source has ever been largely or completely phased out, as proposed by some for the current transition initiatives and regulation. It was clear from the discussions that for many in developing countries, access to affordable and reliable energy to improve their livelihoods will also be priority and will be part of the overall equation.""About the IEFThe International Energy Forum is the world's largest energy organization, with 71 member countries accounting for 90 percent of the world's energy market. The IEF is the global home of energy dialogue promoting energy security, market stability and transparency.

166,cfc61dea-8d54-35b9-bb3c-3d188b8378e7,LMT,2023-08-02,Lockheed Martin’s $1.7 trillion F-35 fighter jet is 10 years late and 80% over budget—and it could be one of the Pentagon’s biggest success stories,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-1-7-trillion-100000423.html,1690970400,STORY,['LMT'],"[One Sunday in early 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz gave a speech that reversed more than 70 years of pacifist foreign policy in his nation. Vladimir Putin had just invaded Ukraine, and Scholz’s address to parliament was short, urgent, and written for the ages. Scholz announced that Germany would immediately invest about $100 billion in its military—more than doubling annual spending levels—and boost its defense budget to 2% of its annual GDP from then on. Scholz framed Putin’s invasion as the beginning of a new era of global tension, and he promised that Germany would meet the moment. But while his rhetoric was sweeping, Scholz took time to mention a specific product that he wanted Germany to buy: the ultraexpensive F-35 fighter jet, made by American defense contractor Lockheed Martin.This might seem puzzling to anyone who follows the news. Almost since the F-35 program was announced in 2001, it has been the symbol of America’s dysfunctional military-industrial complex. The jet is 10 years behind schedule for final approval and almost 80% over budget, its production repeatedly stalled by defects and miscalculations. Last fall, comedian Bill Maher captured the conventional thinking about the fighter during a monologue on his HBO show. “We spent $1.5 trillion on the F-35, which has never worked, and never will, and yet we still buy it,” Maher declared, concluding, to peals of laughter, “It’s the Yugo of fighter jets.” Maher’s critique was a little off: The estimated cost of developing, building, and maintaining the F-35 fleet over its anticipated life span of about 60 years is actually $1.7 trillion.Nonetheless, Germany ended up buying nearly 40 of the jets, at a reported cost of $8 billion. Soon after Scholz’s speech, Canada announced that it wanted 88 planes. As the war in Ukraine dragged on, Greece, the Czech Republic, and Singapore all expressed interest in the F-35. And this came on the heels of massive new orders in 2021 from Finland and even the famously neutral Swiss.Story continuesIf the F-35 is such a boondoggle, why are so many governments clamoring to buy it? The answers to this question are vitally important to America and its allies, and to every U.S. taxpayer.The F-35 is the largest program inside the Pentagon, by far, with an annual budget of about $12 billion. Taxpayers have invested heavily in the F-35 for more than 20 years, to the exclusion of other defense and domestic priorities. The opportunity cost is measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.The program is also a measure of the health of Lockheed Martin, the largest weapons company that has ever existed. Lockheed brought in about $66 billion in revenue in 2022, virtually all of it for arms. (The company makes missiles, missile defense systems, warships, and a host of other combat aircraft, among other products.) It sits at the top of an industry that’s more important to national security than ever: About 58% of the Pentagon budget went to private contractors in 2020, the highest share in 20 years, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Ultimately, the F-35 is a test case of Lockheed’s and the Pentagon’s ability to deliver results. Put simply, the calculus runs like this: Either the F-35 was a massive waste of resources—the worst-ever example of the defense industry overpromising and underdelivering—or it was a savvy long-term investment that gives America and its allies a substantial advantage over their enemies.Not surprisingly, Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon endorse the latter interpretation. Lockheed says the F-35 will be a central node of the U.S. war machine for years to come. “The F-35 is, without question, the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world. We continue to make advances to it, to keep it ahead of the threat,” says Bridget Lauderdale, Lockheed’s vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. Michael Schmidt, the Air Force three-star general who oversees the program for the Department of Defense, says the plane isn’t just a success, but a necessity. “These are investments that we’re making on behalf of our country and our allies to ensure that we own the skies,” Schmidt tells Fortune, in an office with sweeping views of the Pentagon and Capitol Hill. “That’s the only way you’re going to win in war.”FORT WORTH, TEXAS (Nov. 03, 2022) – F-35 Joint Program Executive Officer (PEO) Lt. Gen. Michael Schmidt stands elevated above the production floor at Lockheed Martin’s Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas, Nov. 03, 2022, with the F-35 assembly line in the background. This was Schmidt’s first visit to the facility since having assumed the duties of F-35 PEO. The F-35 Joint Program Office is the Department of Defense's focal point for the 5th generation strike aircraft for the Navy, Air Force, Marines, and our allies. The F-35 is the premier multi-mission, 5th-generation weapon system. Its ability to collect, analyze and share data is a force multiplier that enhances all assets in the battle-space: with stealth technology, advanced sensors, weapons capacity, and range. The F-35, which has been operational since July 2015, is the most lethal, survivable, and interoperable fighter aircraft ever built. (U.S. Navy Photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Matthew Olay/Released)Contrary to popular belief and Bill Maher, the F-35 does work. Lockheed has delivered about 960 of the jets so far, with about 630 going to the U.S. military—and the plane has performed effectively in combat multiple times. The F-35 has yet to face protracted battle against a sophisticated foreign military. But if or when it does, its design incorporates technological breakthroughs that could confer a huge edge in battle, enabling it to evade detection while linking U.S. and allied forces in a data-sharing network that could outmaneuver and overwhelm an enemy.The F-35 is indeed plagued by cost overruns and delays. But those problems are inextricably linked to the advances that have gradually won over pilots and governments—advances that until recently have, almost literally, flown under the radar.Newsletter-Gold-LineThe original point of the F-35, ironically, was to save money. In the 1990s, with the Cold War over, military budgets were being cut, and the Pentagon wanted to launch a cheaper, more efficient fighter jet program. The F-35 is called the Joint Strike Fighter because the objective was to build a single plane—lightweight, stealthy, heavily armed, and easy to fly—that could be slightly modified to work for the Air Force, Navy, and Marines, like a uniform car chassis that could be adapted for different models.Lockheed Martin itself was born from the cost-saving mindset of the 1990s, as defense contractors merged to survive leaner times. Daniel Tellep, then-CEO of Lockheed Corp., oversaw its merger with Martin Marietta in 1995. Long before then, Lockheed had become expert at winning enormous long-term contracts. Its core business was based on managing extraordinarily complicated projects, pushing the boundaries of the scientifically possible. Tellep said in a 2019 interview that Lockheed’s greatest strength was its ability to read where the Pentagon was headed, and to get there first. “We did not skimp on investing in advanced technology, research and development, and so forth,” said Tellep, who died in 2020. Lockheed’s famed Skunk Works research base built top-secret planes for the CIA, for example, and helped invent stealth technology, which enables aircraft to evade detection by absorbing or dispersing radar signals.Chart shows F-35 annual deliveriesIn the late 1990s, Lockheed won the Pentagon contract to build the Joint Strike Fighter. But the program was a fiasco almost from the start.Lockheed and the Pentagon immediately slammed into technological hurdles. The F-35 version for the Marines, which was designed to take off vertically rather than from a runway, proved to be exceedingly difficult to get right. (The program eventually abandoned the uniform-chassis idea.) By late 2009 Lockheed had delivered only four of 13 promised test aircraft. The number of labor hours it took to build each plane had ballooned by about 50%. The effort was also plagued by the Pentagon’s decision to make the program “concurrent,” which meant that Lockheed was contracted to keep building F-35s even as it invented capabilities that impacted their design—which in turn required the government to pay for constant upgrades to earlier versions of the jets.Things hit a breaking point in 2010. By then, the acquisition cost for each F-35 had nearly doubled, from $81 million to $156 million. Then–Secretary of Defense Robert Gates held a press conference during which he publicly fired Marine Corps Maj. Gen. David Heinz as the F-35 program director, while punishing Lockheed by withholding $614 million in performance-related payments. Gates imposed reforms across the program. But he didn’t fire Lockheed: Indeed, he pushed back deadlines and authorized more funding to address previous mistakes.Engineers at the Manufacturing Tech Lab in Fort Worth. The Lockheed lab occupies a government-owned factory that built bombers during World War II. Today, military and civilian staff work there side by side.Over the next decade, the F-35 continued to falter in very public ways. In 2015, it performed poorly in a dogfight against older F-16s. Its engine, made by subcontractor Pratt &amp; Whitney, burned so hot that it turned atmospheric sand and grit into glass inside the plane, hurting performance and requiring redesigns. And yet, as new capabilities were added to the F-35, it became apparent that the engine wasn’t powerful enough to provide energy to cool the plane’s internal systems. Maybe most frustrating, the F-35 required several million lines of software code to operate. That code, like all code, turned out to be buggy and in need of constant rewriting. By 2021, the cost of the F-35 had nearly doubled—overall outlays for the project, originally estimated at $233 billion for the first 20 years, had in fact reached $416 billion.By then, the F-35 seemed adrift, and so did Lockheed Martin. The U.S. had just withdrawn from Afghanistan in defeat, and the end of America’s “Forever Wars” there and in Iraq raised the prospect that there might be less need for a Forever Contractor as large as Lockheed. In October 2021, Lockheed warned that its sales outlook was diminishing amid flat-to-declining defense budgets. But Russia essentially solved Lockheed’s problems with the invasion of Ukraine. Military budgets swelled. And global defense dollars started to tell a story at odds with public perception of the F-35. Beneath the blizzard of terrible news, Lockheed had quietly built a revolutionary weapons platform.Newsletter-Gold-LineIn 2019, an Air Force squadron used the F-35 to attack an ISIS weapons depot and tunnel system in Iraq. This followed combat deployments of the jet by the Marines and the Israel Defense Forces in 2018. The Pentagon and Lockheed won’t discuss what happened on those missions, saying such details are classified. But Air Force Col. Yosef Morris led the squadron on the 2019 mission, and when he describes flying the jet, it’s like listening to someone who grew up in the age of radio describe seeing television for the first time.There are three things that make the F-35 so powerful. The first is its stealth technology. The plane was designed to penetrate the thick wall of air defense systems that Russia has been developing for years, especially its S-400 radar-and-missile suite. The S-400 can destroy anything it detects, but the F-35 can get through the wall.The second benefit could be called “the alliance effect.” Here, an analogy to Apple is inescapable. When a nation buys the F-35, it essentially buys the aeronautical version of the latest iPhone and gets access to the entire software and hardware ecosystem surrounding the product. American jets, for example, are designed to communicate seamlessly with the air defense systems of the U.S. and its allies to avoid getting accidentally shot down. It’s as if America and NATO run on iOS, while China and Russia run on Android—and nations must pick one system over the other.This alliance effect is also a key to the F-35’s third big advantage. When Lockheed and the Pentagon talk about the jet, they don’t talk about bombs and missiles. They talk about sensors, data, and instantaneous communication. It’s that infrastructure, pilots like Morris say, that is changing warfare.Up until 2012, Morris had been flying Lockheed’s F-16s. That meant he was using monitors and dashboards designed in the 1970s. Inside a F-16 cockpit, a pilot had a lot of mental work to do. Morris had to check his radar monitor for incoming threats; consult other monitors, like infrared sensors, that might detect a missile launch; look through the plane’s large glass canopy to spot threats his monitors might have missed; and, finally, make sense of it all. To make matters more complicated, F-16 pilots also must interpret signals beamed in from surveillance systems like AWACS or JSTARS, which are hyper-strong but so complex they need their own planes to host them.Being inside the F-35, Morris says, is completely different. The airplane carries a suite of sensors that are the equivalent of having an AWACS and JSTARS on board. The F-35 doesn’t listen to surveillance systems, it is the surveillance system. Its internal computer reads and analyzes reams of data collected by the sensors—a process called sensor fusion, designed by Lockheed—then displays the results on the pilot’s dashboard instantaneously. Morris could now spend much less time figuring out what was going on, and more time deciding what to do about it.“You have an extremely better picture of what’s going on in the battle space, at extremely long ranges, that you didn’t have in [older] fighters like an F-16,” explains Morris, who retired last year.Much of this technology was developed at a secretive shop run by Santi Bulnes, Lockheed’s vice president of engineering and technology for aeronautics. Bulnes has been at Lockheed for decades, helping to develop the original F-35 prototype in the 1990s. His shop has taken the lead role on the jet’s sensors and monitors—and, even more important, in networking the F-35s.Thanks to their sensors, F-35s present a much clearer picture of the battlefield. But Lockheed has also designed them to share this picture with one another, at ultrafast speeds. The jets have evolved to become the central nodes of a massive communication network, creating a giant field of awareness that can share information with all the elements in a military effort, including ground-based missile launchers, drones, older fighters like the F-16, battleships, and satellites.“Imagine you’re fishing. You could use one fishing line, or you can use a net and more easily collect everything,” Bulnes says. “Well, the F-35s are netted together. Whatever one person sees, everybody sees. And that is something that I don’t think folks really understood—how powerful it was going to be.”Infographic shows the F-35 Lightning II featuresIn modern warfare, where reaction times are measured in milliseconds, this information web offers a critical advantage. In the fog of war, when strategy and communications often break down, forces anchored by F-35s could stay connected and respond rapidly in ways that are effective and unpredictable—perhaps bombing a supply line during a wave of cyberattacks. Niccolò Petrelli, an Italian defense analyst, called the jets’ information systems a “quantum leap.”That leap has been a long time coming, and its course has been altered—and made more expensive—by myriad technological changes. But the system’s long, slow development illuminates the core of Lockheed Martin’s business strategy. The company is patient, quietly matching its engineering talent against the desires of the Pentagon until it achieves the right fit. It’s sort of like building a house when the client keeps asking you to add new rooms and, along the way, to invent a new kind of air-conditioning system. At the same time, Lockheed endures public humiliation in the town square of congressional hearings. One hangover from the F-35’s 2010 budget crisis: Every year, Congress’s General Accounting Office publishes an audit of the program, which inevitably (and accurately) reports that the F-35 is late and over budget—stoking more ugly headlines.It’s U.S. taxpayers who foot the bill, with interest. The cost overruns obey what is almost an iron rule of the military-industrial complex, says Norman Augustine, who served as CEO of Lockheed Martin in the late 1990s. Big programs follow the same cost curve, he explains: Initially, development costs are stratospheric and almost always higher than expected because there’s actual invention involved, and the innovation process is unpredictable. But then costs can decline as companies refine their production process and more units are sold to the U.S. and allies.The F-35 may finally have reached that second phase, where trial and error have brought it in line with the Pentagon’s—and taxpayers’—expectations. But Augustine notes that the cycle inevitably repeats itself, in part because national security imperatives always dominate. “I’m not arguing in favor of overruns and delays,” he says. “But it’s more important to get it right than to get it fast. There are no trophies given for fast failures.”Newsletter-Gold-LineIt can be difficult to tell sometimes where Lockheed Martin ends and the government begins. Lockheed’s aeronautics division is based in a giant government-owned factory in Fort Worth that was built to produce bombers for World War II. The Pentagon agency that oversees the F-35 program, meanwhile, occupies a private office building in a complex called Crystal City, in the Washington, D.C., suburbs. In both places, civilians in business-casual attire work alongside active-service military. When Lt. Gen. Schmidt walks past the cubicles outside his sixth-floor offices, soldiers in uniform stand up behind their desks at attention.Schmidt took over the F-35 program last year, inheriting a sprawling system of expensive and complicated subprograms. When critics note that the jet still hasn’t been “approved,” they’re referring to the milestone known as “final, full-rate production.” Approval at that level would move the F-35 out of the development stage and allow Lockheed to produce it as quickly as possible. (It currently builds about 125 planes a year.) But approval has been delayed repeatedly, for countless reasons. For one, the flight simulator needed to test the F-35 to Pentagon specifications doesn’t exist yet. This isn’t because Lockheed doesn’t know how to build a simulator; it’s at least partly because the F-35 keeps expanding the horizon of what needs to be simulated. The fighter sucks in signature emissions from radar, submarines, phone towers, other planes, and even visual cues like puffs of smoke. A simulator hasn’t yet been built that can imitate all this data in a fast-moving, interwoven way that would resemble a war zone.Every improvement, it seems, begets expense, delays, or both. The F-35 engine is being upgraded: The Air Force has requested $255 million just for design contracts, and hasn’t estimated how much the improvements will cost, according to the GAO. Schmidt is pushing forward “Tech Refresh 3,” a major upgrade to the F-35 computer infrastructure that will cost more than $1.6 billion. The first F-35 with the refresh came off the assembly line this summer, but the Pentagon could not accept delivery because more software testing needs to be done. The Pentagon expects that issue to be resolved by April 2024, while Lockheed thinks it might happen sooner, but regardless, the planes will sit idle until testing is completed.Whether the program eventually becomes a financial success for Lockheed may depend on America’s allies. The U.S. is seeking to buy the same number of F-35s as it wanted more than 20 years ago—about 2,500. Any additional sales would come from overseas partners, and that demand seems to be growing. Schmidt estimates that within 10 years, the U.S. will operate 60 F-35s in Europe, while European nations will operate 600. The prices reported for recent foreign sales have averaged out to between $150 million and $200 million per plane, including service and maintenance. That may seem steep, but in a sense, it’s a bargain: Those nations’ taxpayers haven’t paid additional billions for the plane’s long development. And the money from those additional foreign sales ultimately goes back to Lockheed.Criticism of the F-35 remains strong, and it has been stoked by the conflict in Ukraine, where a shortage of basic munitions has endangered the war effort. Such shortfalls highlight concerns that the U.S. overinvests in “gold-plated” weapons systems despite the fact that most warfare is defined by long, grinding fights that eat up equipment, says Richard Faulkner, a military historian who teaches at the Army’s Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kans.“The biggest problem, of course, is the damn [F-35s] are almost handmade,” Faulkner says. “So if you lose one, you’re not getting another one for two to three to four years. If you get yourself stuck in attritional war—and warfare is inherently attritional—you start losing these things, you’re going to have a problem finding anything to replace them.”It’s hard to gauge how vulnerable the F-35 is. J.R. McDonald, Lockheed’s vice president of business development for the jet, suggests that the world’s two other superpowers, or at least their equipment, are the bar against which the plane will be measured. “While it’s unlikely that we fight Russia and China, it is 100% likely that we will fight Russian and Chinese weapons,” McDonald says.It’s noteworthy that American pilots have flown in Syria, where Russian-made air defense systems are active, and in the Pacific region, where Chinese systems operate. The F-35 has not been shot down in either arena. Active-duty pilots say that’s a meaningful sign. “I have guys who I’ve served with for 25-plus years tell me: ‘Without this jet, we lose the fight,’ ” said Navy Capt. Scott Buchar, who works at the Pentagon’s F-35 office.Even as the F-35 seems to be ironing out its problems—and even before it has faced full-scale warfare—decision-makers are thinking about its replacement. The Air Force has announced a competition for a new class of combat aircraft, a project that it calls Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD. The project calls for a sensor-rich, tightly interlinked system—not unlike the F-35—that will rely at least partially on unmanned aircraft. It’s not clear which companies have submitted bids for the project (that’s classified), but Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein says Lockheed is almost certainly in the running. “It’ll be astonishing if they don’t get some sort of position, if not the lead position on NGAD,” he says. “Why? That’s what they do.”Lockheed’s position seems secure because it’s still America’s foremost workshop of war, despite its stumbles. Just as important, nearly $500 billion in spending has put the F-35 where it was intended to be—at the heart of the evolution toward networked, data-heavy warfare. “F-35 is absolutely in the middle of the game. Today it’s the quarterback,” says Lauderdale, Lockheed’s general manager of the F-35 program. “And as the game changes it will continue, for decades to come, to be exceptionally relevant.”This article appears in the August/September 2023 issue of Fortune with the headline, “The fall and rise of a $17.7 trillion fighter plane.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

KlappaWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.92 a share. After a down first quarter marked by one of the warmest winters on record, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and we're firmly on track for a strong 2023. Today, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. The range is $4.58 to $4.62 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather going forward. As always, we're focused on the fundamentals of our business: Financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. During the second quarter, we also continued to move forward on our major initiatives, including the investments outlined in our $20.1 billion ESG progress plan. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. We expect to quadruple the amount of renewable generation for our regulated customers, add highly efficient gas field capacity to ensure reliability and continue to harden our delivery networks. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in just a moment. As a reminder, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive growth in earnings per share of 6.5% to 7% a year. And as we've discussed, there is no need to issue equity for this $20.1 billion 5-year plan. Now over the past few months, many of you have asked about the trajectory of our next 5-year plan. Our updated plan will cover the period 2024 through 2028. Of course, if growth in demand for capacity and energy drives our next capital plan significantly higher, then we'll evaluate all our financing options. In addition to incremental debt and refinancing opportunities, our options could include accessing the equity market through our dividend reinvestment plans, employee benefit plans and at-the-market programs. I would stress that at this point, we do not see the need for any block equity offering. Again, as a reminder, any equity need would be driven by growth and would support our long-term growth projections. As you would expect, we're on schedule with the development of our next 5-year plan, and as usual, we'll share the details with you in the fall. Now let's take a brief look, we'll switch gears and take a brief look at our regional economy. We're still seeing a very strong labor market in Wisconsin. In June, the state added 7,000 private sector jobs. The unemployment rate came in at 2.5%, well below the national average, and the labor force participation rate rose for the fourth straight month in Wisconsin to 65.3%. Very solid numbers. We're also encouraged by the pipeline of economic activity in our region. Last quarter, you heard that Microsoft plans to make an initial investment of $1 billion to create a new data center campus. This new complex will be built south of Milwaukee, in the Wisconsin Innovation Park where Foxconn is located. Microsoft has purchased 315 acres in Area 3 of the park and is moving full speed ahead. In fact, earthwork at the site began just a few days ago. So along with American Transmission Company, we're working closely, in fact, on a weekly basis with Microsoft to determine the full extent of the energy infrastructure that will be needed to serve this development. We're excited about supporting Microsoft as the company moves forward with a major technology investment, and we'll update you as the planning proceeds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments and on our operations. Scott, all yours.Scott J. LauberThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. In May, we filed a limited reopener to set 2024 rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The filings address the recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into Service this year and in 2024. These are renewable facilities, RICE generation and LNG reliability investments. The projects have already been approved by the Wisconsin Commission. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. We expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year. And as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. After 9 years without a base rate case at Peoples Gas, we're making these requests for 2024 to support our investments in critical infrastructure. In mid-July, the staff filed its rebuttal testimony, recommending a 9.83% return on equity and an equity layer of 50.83% for Peoples Gas. This was consistent with the initial recommendations from the staff. We expect a final decision by the end of the year. And moving to the other states, we are very pleased that we have reached a settlement agreement in our rate reviews at both Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. The Minnesota Commission is considering a settlement that would provide a 7.1% increase in base rates. As a quick reminder, that's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. And we're pleased to update you that in Michigan, we have reached a unanimous settlement, and the details will be made public later this week. We expect final commission approval by the end of the year. Meanwhile, we're continuing progress on a number of regulatory -- regulated capital projects. At the beginning of June, we closed on our first option of West Riverside Energy Center for $95 million. This adds 100-megawatt of efficient and combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. As you recall, this plant is in operation and the purchase price was based on book value. And in the next few weeks, we plan to file a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option. We also put 128 megawatts of new natural gas generation online last month. As you recall, we invested $170 million to build this generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The facility uses 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. Elsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris and Darien Solar Battery Parks. The Badger Hollow II site has begun receiving panels using non-Chinese polysilicon. Also, we continue to work on securing custom release of panels from a bonded warehouse in Chicago, and we're still expecting Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year, with Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work has begun on the Darien solar facility, which is planned to go into service in 2024. We'll keep you posted and update on future developments. With that, I'll turn you back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaScott, thanks very much. As you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. We believe this continues to rack our dividend growth in the top decile of our industry. We're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and unveil our third quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.Xia LiuThanks, Gale. Our 2023 2nd quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Our earnings from utility operations were $0.04 above the second quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.05 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These negative variances were more than offset in the quarter. Rate based growth contributed $0.11 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. Additionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.05, and lower day-to-day O&amp;M taxes and other items resulted in a $0.02 improvement. Before I turn to earnings at the other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine , was down 0.6% on a weather-normal basis. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage, again, on a weather-normal basis was flat quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with our forecast. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.4%, which is ahead of forecast. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the second quarter of '23 compared to the second quarter of '22. This was largely driven by higher production tax credits as a result of the acquisition of renewable projects. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.05, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. This was partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&amp;M. Overall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.01 per share compared to last year and by $0.08 per share compared to the midpoint of our Q2 guidance. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat compared to the prior year, and total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion during the first half of 2023, an increase of more than $1 billion from the first half of 2022. This was primarily driven by acquisitions of generation projects in our regulated and infrastructure segment. Now, let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We're expecting a range of $0.88 to $0.90 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.96 per share in the third quarter last year, which included a positive $0.02 from weather and a $0.05 pickup related to the resolution of a MISO ROE complaint. As Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. As a reminder, largely due to timing of O&amp;M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in Q4 to be materially better than Q4 of 2022. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.Gale E. KlappaGreat, Xia. Thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.Gale E. KlappaJulien, before we start, I know -- before we start, I know a great puppy trainer, so just let me know Julien, are you still with us?Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithCan you hear me now?Gale E. KlappaWe can, I thought I heard a dog barking in the back there.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithYou can , I am sorry about that. I don't know what happened. I thought I was on mute there, but go figure.Gale E. KlappaI was just saying Julien -- Julien, I was just saying that I know a great puppy trainer, so let me know.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithAll right. I'm going to put it duly noted, sir, duly noted. I appreciate it. And by the way, congrats guys on all the updates here. Really nicely done. . And to that effect, when you think about the settlement here in Michigan, how do you think about Illinois here and the ability to settle that out at least in part here, as you get through the bulk of the hearings here in the near term? Any opportunities? And also any thoughts here on the legislative side going into 2024 for gas in Illinois as well?Gale E. KlappaOkay. I appreciate the questions, Julien, very much. Tackle the first 1 first, and that's any potential or possibility for a rate settlement in our Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas cases in Illinois. So as many of you know, the way the process really unfolds during normal rate reviews in Illinois. Historically, settlement windows really don't occur, really don't open until the administrative law judge has prepared a draft order. And if I remember correctly, the schedule for that administrative law judge draft order probably looks like late October, early November. Scott is agreeing that that's the case. So if there's a settlement opportunity, I think those discussions would take place probably in the November time frame, so we'll see. Again, as Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, the staff has reiterated its position with a 93% return on equity recommendation and an equity layer higher than what we have at Peoples Gas today. So I hope that responds to your question. And then as far as legislation related to gas in Illinois, we just have to see what takes place. And -- but first things first, we continue to work on a positive resolution of the cases currently pending before the Illinois Commerce Commission. I hope that helps, Julien.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithCertainly does. And then just quickly, if I can. Any thoughts about converts here? I mean I heard your opening comments, Gale. I'm just curious if open to following the trend across the space?Gale E. KlappaYes. As we look at our financing package that we needed to support our new 5-year capital plan, I mean we'll look at it. It could be part of mix. But again, I think it really depends upon the circumstances at the time. We haven't ruled it out. We followed the companies that have used this particular financing. And I think you saw one announced today, as a matter of fact. So we haven't ruled it out. We haven't ruled it in, but it certainly will be part of what we look at going forward.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.Gale E. KlappaShar, you didn't do any permanent damage to those Porsches, did you?Shahriar PourrezaYou have to ask Southern company that, not me.Gale E. KlappaWell, I noticed they're taking a charge this quarter, so I was a little worried about what you did down there.Shahriar PourrezaWe'll have to wait for that one, but ... I know you mentioned the Microsoft facility could be in service by late '24, early '25, which obviously that overlaps with your existing 5-year plan through '27. Should we be thinking about Microsoft-related investment as something that's separate and incremental to the current 5-year plan? Or is the focus on maintaining that 7.7% asset-based growth as you manage customer affordability? So in other words, so could other base spending be pushed out to make room for Microsoft-related spending?Gale E. KlappaWell, great question, Shar. And first off, I don't think really, just given the magnitude of the construction, that Microsoft seems to be planning. My own belief is we won't see the Microsoft campus in operation in 2024. I think that's just too much of a stretch. My guess, although the company is still very much in its -- refining its plans, my guess is fourth quarter '25, early '26 would be my guess for the first element of the plan that Microsoft is putting together to be operational. And then secondly, to your question about would the Microsoft investment that we need to make to support their energy needs and reliability, would that investment be incremental to the plan? Absolutely incremental to the plan. I don't think there's any question about that, because it was not in our current 5-year plan. Although there are many moving pieces at this stage of the game, but I would just say this is a really positive, exciting opportunity for a major new high-tech investment in our state.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. So we shouldn't look at it as crowding out other base-related spending as you're managing rates in the [vehicle]?Gale E. KlappaNo, absolutely. I mean think about -- it's a great question, Shar, but I would think about it this way. I mean, clearly, with the way our customer rates are set, demand from Microsoft, I mean essentially, I mean given the rate charges that Microsoft would receive, they will pay their fair share of whatever additional capacity and energy is needed. So it wouldn't be a crowd out type of a factor at all, in my opinion.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. And then just on the equity comments, Gale, I just want to get a little bit of a better sense on timing and the trigger. Is it like would it be Microsoft-related spending? Because I have to imagine if the facility is whatever, '25, '26 facility, the generation needs would be -- before that, transmission and distribution needs would be before that. So what's the trigger for incremental equity? Is it Microsoft? Or is there other things we should be thinking about?Gale E. KlappaI think it's both. I mean certainly, if we need to add significant capacity to support Microsoft's operation here, but there are other things going on. The other economic developments that have occurred for example, I mean, we talk a lot about Haribo but they are now up and running. And they've told us they will produce 132 million pounds of gummy bears in the next 12-month period, so there's a good bit of economic activity going on. So if you think about transmission, and we're going to start to see in the next 5-year plan the impact of trough one from the MISO planning process, so I think we're going to see an uptick in transmission investments. I think we're going to see clearly some additional capacity needed. We need to continue to harden our distribution networks. There are a lot of moving pieces, and all of them moving in a direction of a stronger capital budget. And as Scott and I have talked about, stronger for longer in terms of our continuing growth projections.Shahriar PourrezaOkay. Perfect. I guess we'll wait for EEI. Should be an interesting update. And for the record, Gale, I did not crash Porsches.Gale E. KlappaRock and roll, Shar.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.Durgesh ChopraJust -- Xia, sorry if I missed it, but what drove the $0.08 variance versus guidance? Like what are the kind of the tailwinds you had which then drove the [Beat] versus your guidance in the quarter?Gale E. KlappaXia told me it was superior management, but she probably has a more granular answer.Xia LiuIt was a little better fuel and quite a bit better O&amp;M, and weather was actually slightly negative compared to normal with better fuel, better O&amp;M and a couple of other items.Durgesh ChopraGot it. So I mean I guess in terms of the guidance for back half of the year, I'm just thinking about like how are you positioned versus your guidance there. I mean, it's better O&amp;M versus your plan, correct?Xia LiuYes. We see quite a bit of O&amp;M tailwind coming in the fourth quarter, so we'll expect to see O&amp;M to be much better than Q4 last year. We expect fuel to be better and additional PTCs and other items, but quite a bit of O&amp;M fuel tailwind in the fourth quarter.Gale E. KlappaAnd Durgesh, just to add on to what Xia's saying. If you recall, there were a number of very significant items in Q4 last year that will not repeat in Q4 this year, so there's a very major difference as we compare the comps for Q4 of 2022 and what we expect to happen in Q4 of this year.Xia LiuAnd remember, we guided 2% to 3% higher on day-to-day O&amp;M this year compared to last year. So you see some quarter-to-quarter variances, but for the year, we still expect that to be 2% to 3% higher than last year.Durgesh ChopraUnderstood. Maybe just, Xia, just -- I know we recently talked about transferability and the implications to FFO, and there was a lot of discussion amongst your peers on how that needs to be -- how that should be treated. Maybe just any additional color or thoughts there or progress you're making with other stakeholders on how are you going to treat the transferability as cash flow?Gale E. KlappaWe'll ask Xia to give you the detail on this, but I would say one very important point to kind of kick off the answer is that our entire industry is really aligned around what we believe is the proper treatment of these ongoing transfers that will happen across the industry, the ongoing sale of production tax credits. And that alignment across the industry has really resulted in I think, Xia, a very thorough and very solid white paper.Xia LiuYes. We -- I developed a very comprehensive white paper. Really outlined the views from FASB from the big 4 accounting firms, from the -- over, like Gale said, the industry. So they shared the white paper with the rating agencies and all that is to say, I think everybody is aligned in terms of we plan to follow GAAP and the transferability will go through income tax provision on income statement, therefore, would be picked up as FFO. So we are looking forward to continuing to work with the rating agencies on this issue. I will say, though, is we would not issue equity just to address that transferability item. So that's something we'll continue to work with rating agencies.Durgesh ChopraGot it. So it sounds like discussion is underway there. I appreciate that color as well.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGale, Xia and Scott, No dogs, no Porsches, but plenty of gummy bears here. Just maybe 2 housekeeping items I had on the PDF Page 12 of your release. Just curious if you could give us some more color. The decline in large commercial industrial sales, and maybe I have the wrong view, I typically view them as maybe like weather agnostic, but yet they've come in 3%. Just thoughts on that?Gale E. KlappaYes. A couple of thoughts, and we'll ask Xia to give you some chapter and verse on some specifics. But 2 things that as we've looked at the data, and again, we have a very granular breakdown of the major industrial sectors that we serve. So let me first say, most people, just as you mentioned, Anthony, look at large commercial and industrial as fairly weather insensitive. Fairly, as you said, fairly weather agnostic. I will say, though, and you've heard me say this a gazillion times, that the weather normalization is more -- it's more precise and accurate. And as we look at kind of backdrop of the economy in Wisconsin, as we look at the jobs that have been added and as we kind of look at the industrial sectors, I would describe the industrial economy in Wisconsin for the first half of 2023 is really fairly flat. There were a couple of major customers who had outages, planned outages, et cetera, that affected the numbers. But the 3% seems, on a weather-normal basis, seems a little draconian to me. I think Scott and I and Xia have already worked through this, and we kind of look at it as kind of first half flat. But having said that, the most recent data is pretty encouraging. Xia?Xia LiuYes. Just to put it in perspective, in Q1, we saw a minus 3.9% quarter-over-quarter. Q2, that number became better to minus 3.1%, like you pointed out, Anthony. I think if you look at Q2 by month, June was fairly close to the forecast. If you look at the last 4 weeks compared to the last 13 weeks or even the prior 4 weeks, we're seeing lots of green. Actually, everything was picking up. So we are very cautiously optimistic that the large C&amp;I will come back in the second half of the year, so nothing to worry too much about. And I would just say that on residential, it's pretty flat year-over-year, and -- but it's fairly better than prior to COVID, and that's the sticky point on the residential usage. Small C&amp;I, actually year-to-date, is on par with last year. So those are higher-margin segments.Anthony Christopher CrowdellGreat. And then just lastly, you've been very clear on what would cause you to issue more equity. Xia, you had said it's not so much to -- if it was to -- I don't want to say, put the words in your mouth, but like the credit agency, it's more for growth. Is it fair to say that if you got to the point where there was more growth that had to be financed that you would finance that -- a cap structure that's probably equal to what you have at the regulated utilities? Or is there an opportunity that you would look to over-equitize, I guess the term some are using, if you had the additional to get some growth going on?Xia LiuI think the first and foremost is we're still developing the capital plan. So the numbers are -- we're still developing it. But like Gale said in his prepared remarks, if growth, capital growth is significantly higher, we wouldn't mind turning on the employee benefit plans, the dribble plans and rely on maybe ATM, but we don't see any block sales at this point, number one. Number two, we are very confident in our long-term EPS growth forecast. We don't expect any equity sales to dilute the long-term EPS growth. And I'll also say that we're very mindful about the rating agencies and we want to work with them, but the equity would be to support growth.Gale E. KlappaAnd a very good description that Xia just made. I will say, she also mentioned and I would just reiterate, for the one item on FFO to debt that might affect our rating at one particular agency, we wouldn't issue equity simply to chase that particular item.Xia LiuThat's the transferability. That's transferability. Yes.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.Gale E. KlappaRock and roll, Michael.Julien Patrick Dumoulin-SmithWanted to just circle back to the Microsoft, and just what you're seeing in terms of long-term sales growth potential there? And then maybe if you could just compare and contrast what this looks like relative to -- there was a lot of excitement around the Foxconn build out a couple of years ago. I know different companies, different situations. But just in terms of how you think about that from a planning standpoint, with another big name company coming to your service territory?Gale E. KlappaYes. Great question, Michael. Let me just phrase it this way. I think we will certainly know by the fall and certainly in time for our new 5-year capital plan, what the next -- what the time period between now and say, 2030 will look like in terms of Microsoft's capacity and energy needs. I mean they are -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks, they are full speed ahead. I mean they purchased the 315 acres in a very short period of time in that technology park, earthwork has already begun, they are still refining their plans. .But everything we're hearing from Microsoft would indicate that they're planning a very major investment here, and they need to do it in a relatively short time frame. So there's really no question in our minds about how strong the intention and how strong the momentum is from the Microsoft development. As it relates to Foxconn, well, back in 2017, they announced a long-term, very, very significant plan. They were talking about 10,000 jobs over 10 to 12 years or 10 to 13 years. They were talking about $10 billion of investment. At this stage of the game, Foxconn, which is working in Area 1 of that park, Foxconn has invested over $1 billion and has over 1,000 employees. So while they have been slower to ramp up and their business plan has changed almost completely from the original thinking, they are still growing in that area. But Microsoft, I think they're really not talking at the moment about a long-term 10 to 15-year plan like Foxconn was. They're talking about, at least at the beginning here, they've called it an initial investment that they really want to get moving on, and that would affect our next 5-year capital plan. Does that respond to your question, Michael?Michael P. SullivanYes. Super helpful. And just as a follow-on, I think someone asked earlier or there's been a couple of questions around new capacity needs and new generation that you might have to build. And given the quick turnaround time, is further delaying any currently-planned retirements contemplated at all if things were looking kind of tight from a time frame perspective?Gale E. KlappaWell, that's a great question, and we're looking at all of that. I'll let Scott give you his view on that.Scott J. LauberSo we're going -- it's a great question. We're going through the planning process right now. We're evaluating what our capacity needs are. And you know MISO has changed is capacity needs over the seasonal approach too, which will also affect our capital plans as we look at it this fall. So right now, nothing to announce. We're just going through the analysis.Gale E. KlappaScott has made a really good point that we shouldn't gloss over though, and that is as MISO has looked at its responsibility to ensure reliability, they really are changing their capacity rules that all of us need to abide by. And it will have a -- we believe it will have a particular effect on our winter capacity reserves. That's all being factored into our new 5-year capital plan.Michael P. SullivanGot it. Okay.OperatorWith that, I will turn the call back over to Gale Klappa for any closing remarks.Gale E. KlappaTerrific. Well, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for being with us. If you have any additional questions, feel free to call Beth Straka. She can be reached most days, no, everyday at (414) 221-4639. Thanks, everybody.

170,652ce47d-1b9d-3048-94e0-73fd76834089,JNJ,2023-08-02,10 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-recent-ipos-2023-consider-050832348.html,1690952912,STORY,"['TSLA', 'NXT', 'JNJ', 'CAVA', 'GNLX']","[In this piece, we will take a look at ten recent IPOs in 2023. If you want to skip background activity in the sector this year, then head on over to 5 Recent IPOs in 2023 to Consider. Most companies don't list their shares on the stock market. While big ticket names such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla get all the attention, the fact is that only 0.1% of companies in the U.S. have more than 500 employees. Yet, as any fan of the stock market would point out, the biggest companies are often the most valuable or have the most value. And, most of the biggest companies are often either state backed or publicly traded as back of the envelope estimates show that the top ten largest companies in the world in revenue terms are publicly traded.Going public brings a multitude of benefits for both the firm and the investors that buy its shares. For the firm owners, if the initial public offering (IPO) is successfully executed and a strong business plan generates interest, then their shareholdings can significantly appreciate in value. As a simple example, consider the fact that Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Mr. Elon Musk became the company's majority shareholder in less than two years after it was incorporated by just pitching in $6.5 million in a Series A funding round. Now, Musk's current stake in America's largest electric vehicle manufacturer is worth a rather sizeable $190 billion. On a side note, Tesla has also limited the ability of shares that have been pledged for loans and can be collateralized to less than 25% of the stock unless less than $3.5 billion, interesting considering the fact that Musk has pledged almost 58% of his Tesla stock.So, back to IPOs. Tesla went public in 2010 and since then the stock is up by more than 20,000% - which turns a dollar invested back then to more than $200. Not bad considering that only a few companies can beat or match this performance. For instance, the most expensive share on the stock market is Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), whose gains on the market since stock started trading turn a dollar back then into more than $500 now, similar to the shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but significantly less than Apple's.Story continuesWhile new firms tend to thrive in an open credit environment with low inflation and stable growth rates, the rapid shifts in the U.S. economy have not deterred a lot of firms from making the plunge and listing their shares for trading. Data shows that as of end July 2023, nearly 91 firms have gone public, and the group has shown modest performance on the market after listing. Out of these, only 53% are trading higher than their listing price. The percentage of firms demonstrating positive returns grows when only the second quarter of 2023 is considered. During the three months between April and June, 34 firms listed their shares for trading and 19 are in positive territory. July continues to extend this trend, as between May and July, an impressive 21 firms out of the 32 that have listed their stock have seen positive buying activity from investors.One rockstar on the stock market that IPO'd earlier this year is the biotechnology firm Genelux Corporation (NASDAQ:GNLX). Genelux listed its shares in January, and the stock is up an impressive 286% year to date with the biggest share price gains taking place between February and mid-June. It develops treatments for ovarian cancer and has reported some positive data since listing the shares.A share price pop after an IPO doesn't have to last only a couple of days. After all, the biggest pops take place over the years, decades perhaps. Going long on the right stocks is quite rewarding, with one of the most successful investors of all time Warren Buffett smartly using this strategy. Our own research of some firms that started trading in pennies at the time of their public listing shows that a few have literally turned a dollar into a grand. Consider the story of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), one of the world's largest electronic commerce retailers. Amazon's shares IPO'd at $15, which translates into $0.075 after adjusting for four stock splits that split the shares 27 to 1. They currently trade at $128, which marks a stunning gain of 170,600%. In short, a dollar put in Amazon's stock in 1997 would be worth $1,706 today - a fact that has turned the firm's founder and former CEO Mr. Jeff Bezos into one of the richest men on Earth.So, what are some IPOs that have taken place recently that rank high in terms of market capitalization? We took a brief look and narrowed down some firms.10 Recent IPOs in 2023 to ConsiderPixabay/ Public DomainOur Methodology To compile our list of IPOs to consider, we gathered firms that have listed their shares for public offering this year and ranked then by market capitalization.

Non-COVID segments saw 5% growth, but that isn't enough for the company to maintain a strong 2023 outlook.The company reduced the upper end of its guidance by $1 billion, for a new range of $67 billion to $70 billion for 2023, and reduced from 7%-9% growth (non-COVID) to 6%-8%.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla acknowledged the uncertainty of waning demand for COVID products but said it wouldn't last.""We are all almost in agreement that the uncertainty of COVID — which is there and it is real and it is quite significant — will disappear by the end of the year,"" he told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday.""Whatever will be the vaccination rates this fall ... and whatever will be the treatment and infection rates for COVID this fall, there is no reason to think that that will not be repeated in the years to come,"" Bourla added.""When we come to some certainty of what COVID will be ... even if it is very little, still remains a strong product in our pipeline,"" Bourla said.CFO David Denton said he knows analysts have been waiting to see how the company performs outside of the pandemic, which is why it didn't get a boost in recent years despite the COVID windfall.""Our cost structure and our investment focus will be aligned to the revenue going forward, so that people can get comfort that we have levers to pull financially so that we ... can make sure we deliver financially on our promise to investors,"" Denton said.Men walk by Pfizer headquarters, Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Beyond COVIDBeyond COVID, the company is working on building up its pipeline as it faces patent cliffs for some of its products. That is what drove its acquisition of Seagen (SGEN), which is still in the works awaiting Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance. Denton said once that deal closes it should also help with investor confidence.Story continuesPfizer has received six FDA approvals so far this year and expects another half dozen through the rest of the year.One of those approved is its RSV vaccine for adults ages 60 and older, the demand for which will be tested in the upcoming cold and flu season.That, in addition to mixed revenue on some of Pfizer's top products, is why JPM analysts called Tuesday's report ""mixed.""""Overall, we view today’s update as a mixed one for (Pfizer). On one hand, new product guidance is coming in below expectations for 2023, and (Pfizer) is acknowledging a highly uncertain COVID outlook. On the other, the company appears willing to adjust its cost base to better match its revenue output in the event COVID sales do not live up to expectations,"" the firm said in a note to clients.Medicare drug negotiationsPfizer's focus on its pipeline comes at a time when the industry is awaiting a list of target drugs that Medicare will negotiate prices for as part of its new powers under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).Big pharma firms like Merck (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) have independently sued the US Health Department, calling the law unconstitutional. They claim the law is an unfair way for the government to set prices. In addition to the companies, the US Chamber of Commerce and lobbying firm PhRMA have also filed separate suits.Pfizer has not filed on its own but is a member of some of the other organizations. Bourla said he agrees with the other companies that the law is going to hurt innovation — a common refrain among critics.""They will hurt innovation and they are already having a damaging impact on some of the decisions companies are making,"" Bourla said. ""It's going to kill a lot of small biotech companies,"" he added.While Pfizer hasn't filed a suit independently, the option is still on the table.""We retain all our rights to do what we think is appropriate,"" Bourla said.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhem.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Revenue from its COVID-19 treatment molnupiravir declined 83%. Revenue from other products grew 14%, and Merck upgraded its guidance by $800 million for the year.Though its acquisition of Prometheus is a long-term positive, having to declare the transaction all in the second quarter was what resulted in the negative impact, according to the company.But the quarter was boosted by sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, up 19%, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil, up 47% due to strong demand in China— which accounted for 39% of the total growth. Both results beat Wall Street expectations for the quarter.Keytruda is a key driver for Merck's continued growth, even as it faces patent expiry in 2028.The company is preparing for competition from biosimilars, but doesn't expect it will grow at the current pace. Merck, like other big pharmaceutical companies, has been dealing with the impact of patent expirations in the past few years.The company sees upside for two new drugs in 2024: sotatercept, a drug it gained from its $11.5 billion acquisition of Acceleron Pharma in late 2021, and a second approval attempt for gefapixant, a chronic cough treatment. Both are in various stages of FDA review.A Merck scientist conducts research on Feb. 28, 2013, in West Point, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)IRA litigationMerck is one of a handful of large pharmaceutical companies that have independently sued the US Health Department (HHS) over the Medicare drug pricing powers in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).Merck called the law unconstitutional, citing similar concerns as other plaintiffs: that the government is setting prices without allowing any recourse for companies.During the earnings call Tuesday, CEO Robert Davis addressed the lawsuit saying the company isn't entirely against the law itself.Story continues""We’ve consistently communicated our support for elements of the law that improve patient affordability and access, such as the Medicare Part D reform, but which do so without damaging the very promising long-term innovation potential of the biopharmaceutical industry,"" Davis said.He added that Merck believes the drug pricing negotiations ""amount to unconstitutional price setting that violates several provisions of the US Constitution. This misguided policy does not strike the right balance between incenting investment in innovation and improving affordability and access.""Davis ended his comments saying that Merck is willing to work with the US government to find a better approach.Merck was the first to file a lawsuit, followed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY). The US Chamber of Commerce as well as lobbying group PhRMA have also filed separate suits.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

In the year-ago period, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.87. The reported loss was due to a one-time charge incurred by the company to acquire Prometheus Biosciences, completed in June.Including acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities and certain other items, loss per share was $2.35. In the year-ago period, Merck reported earnings of $1.55.Revenues rose 3% year over year (7% on a constant currency basis) to $15.04 billion. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.39 billion.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $13.46 billion, up 6% (8% excluding Fx impact) year over year, as higher sales of oncology drugs and vaccines more than offset the lower sales of Merck’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) and diabetes medicines. Excluding Lagevrio, Pharmaceutical sales grew 14%.Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, generated sales of $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19% (21% excluding Fx impact) year over year. Keytruda sales gained from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers, and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.87 billion and our estimate of $5.69 billion.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima also boosted oncology sales in the quarter. Merck has a deal with British pharma giant AstraZeneca AZN to co-develop and commercialize PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, and a similar one with Japan’s Eisai for its tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima.Alliance revenues from AstraZeneca-partnered Lynparza increased 13% (15%, excluding Fx impact) year over year to $310 million in the quarter, driven by increased demand. Lenvima alliance revenues were $242 million, up 5% from the year-ago period’s levels.Story continuesIn the hospital specialty portfolio, neuromuscular blockade medicine, Bridion injection generated sales of $502 million in the quarter, up 18% year over year, driven by increased demand and market share.In vaccines, sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 47% year over year to $2.46 billion, driven by strong demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. Gardasil sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 billion and our estimate of $1.71 billion.Proquad, M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines recorded combined sales of $582 million, up 1% year over year. Sales of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotateq were down 25% to $131 million while Pneumovax 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) vaccine sales declined 40% to $92 million. Sales of Vaxneuvance, Merck’s new pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, were $168 million compared with $106 million in the previous quarter, driven by continued uptake in the pediatric group.Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales were down 30% year over year to $864 million. The drug sales were hurt by lower demand and pricing in the United States and generic competition in certain international markets. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China and the European Union last year.The company’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) generated sales of $203 million during the second quarter, down 83% year over year. Lower sales in Japan and no sales in the United Kingdom hurt Lagevrio sales. Lagevrio sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million but missed our estimates of $221 million.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.46 billion, down 1% year over year (up 2% excluding Fx impact). Animal Health segment sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 billion.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin was 76.6%, up 190 basis points year over year, driven by the favorable impact of product mix and lower sales of Lagevrio, a low-margin product.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.6 billion in the reported quarter, up 8% year over year due to higher administrative costs and higher promotional spending.Adjusted research and development (R&amp;D) spending was $13.3 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, due to a one-time charge of $10.2 billion related to theacquisition of Prometheus Biosciences.2023 Guidance UpdatedMerck raised its sales outlook for 2023. The company expects revenues to be in the range of $58.6-$59.6 billion in 2023 compared with $57.7-$58.9 billion previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $58.7 billion.Lagevrio is expected to generate $1.0 billion in sales in 2023, a significant decline from $5.7 billion in 2022.The adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 77% (maintained).Following the completion of the $10.2 billion acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences in June, the company updated its operating expense and earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the full year.Adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $2.95 and $3.05 after accounting for a charge of $4.02 per share incurred by Merck for the Prometheus acquisition. Prior to the acquisition completion, the company expected adjusted EPS to be between $6.88 and $7.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.89 per share.Adjusted operating costs are expected to be in the range of $34.0 to $34.6 billion versus the prior expectation of $23.3 to $24.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be approximately 30.5% to 31.5% (previously: 17% to 18%).Our TakeMerck’s second-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. Strong sales of key products cancer drug, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine drove the top line in the quarter. Merck also raised its full-year sales profit outlook, citing strong global underlying demand for its key products.Merck also expects that charges related to the Prometheus acquisition and the slightly higher impact of currency should be partially offset by a better operational performance. In this regard, management also raised the EPS guidance by 24 cents, attributable to additional business growth.Shares of Merck were up 1.4% in pre-market trading, supported by the better-than-expected earnings results and the guidance increase.In the year so far, the stock has lost 3.9% against the industry’s 2.6% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck has also made meaningful progress in its pipeline in the past year. Alongside partner Moderna MRNA, Merck initiated a phase III study last month evaluating its personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157/V940in melanoma indication. The initiation of this study was based on positive data from a phase IIb study, which previously achieved its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival. This June, Moderna/Merck reported that additional data from this study which showed that treatment with mRNA-4157 led to a statistically significant and clinical improvement in distant metastasis-free survival, a key secondary endpoint of the study.Following the Prometheus acquisition, Merck added PRA023, a humanized monoclonal antibody, to its pipeline. PRA023 is currently being developed in mid-stage studies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and other autoimmune conditions.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the value created by our differentiated capabilities and the execution of our strategic priorities. We continue to successfully grow our business, both organically and through acquisitions while enhancing profitability. During the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 9%, including more than 4% from acquisitions. Generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 10.5%, expanded EBITDA margin by 40 basis points, reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41 and produced $1.26 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 10% increase over the prior year.We continue to effectively allocate capital by investing in acquisitions to create long-term value. Year-to-date, we invested $927 million of acquisitions. All transactions were in the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste space, including the acquisition of assets in Colorado and New Mexico from GFL. The M&amp;A environment remains active with opportunities in both the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste and Environmental Solutions businesses. We now expect investment in value-creating acquisitions to exceed $1 billion for the year.We are making great progress on the integration of US Ecology and increasing the profitability of our Environmental Solutions business. Pricing realization in this business remains strong. Customers value our complete set of products and services. We have achieved over $110 million in new sales to date as a result of cross-selling our products and services. The sales pipeline is robust with opportunities for organic growth and expansion of services within our existing customer base. We achieved more than $40 million of annualized cost synergies and EBITDA margin in the Environmental Solutions business improved to more than 22% in the quarter.The strong results we achieved through the first half of the year, along with the positive momentum in our business, supports a full year financial outlook that exceeds our original expectations. We now expect revenue in a range of $14.775 billion to $14.85 billion, adjusted EBITDA in a range of $4.34 billion to $4.36 billion, adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.33 to $5.38 and adjusted free cash flow in a range of $1.9 billion to $1.925 billion.Our updated financial guidance includes the contribution from acquisitions closed through June 30. The results we are delivering are made possible by executing our strategy, supported by our differentiated capabilities, customer zeal, digital and sustainability.Regarding customer zeal. Our efforts to deliver industry-leading service continues to drive sustained customer loyalty and organic growth. Our customer retention rate remained over 94%, and we continue to see positive trends in our Net Promoter Score supported by improved service delivery. Organic revenue growth remained strong during the quarter and simultaneously increases in both price and volume. Core price on related revenue was 8.8% and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. This includes landfill MSW yield of 6.2%, this is the highest level performance in company history in this category.Organic volume growth on related revenue was 50 basis points. Turning to digital. We have reached a milestone in our efforts to create digital tools to enhance our customers' and employees' experience and deliver meaningful financial benefits. The deployment of RISE tablets in our Recycling &amp; Solid Waste collection business was completed during the second quarter. The next phase of our digital operations is expected to drive additional productivity savings through route adherence, improved safety performance, and provide more predictable service delivery for our customers. In total, we believe the benefits of our digital initiatives are worth approximately $100 million with $50 million already achieved and $50 million to be captured over the next 3 years. Moving on to sustainability. We continue to invest in differentiating capabilities to leverage sustainability as a platform for profitable growth. Earlier today, we announced a joint venture with Ravago called Blue Polymers. This groundbreaking partnership further supports our efforts to lead in plastic circularity. Blue Polymers will utilize recycled olefins for our polymer centers to create blended pellets for use in manufacturing sustainable packaging. We expect to open 4 facilities beginning in late 2024 with earning contribution beginning in 2026.Development of our polymer centers in Las Vegas and the Midwest remain on track with the centers becoming operational in late '23 and late '24, respectively. Demand for recycled plastics remains strong as the consumer goods industry continues to work toward achieving their sustainability goals. For example, we are partnering with the Coca-Cola Company to supply recycled PET from our polymer centers for use in sustainable packaging. The 57 renewable natural gas projects being codeveloped with our partners are advancing. We expect 4 of these projects to be operational by the end of the third quarter.Finally, we continue to believe that creating a more sustainable world is our responsibility and a platform for growth. We recently published our latest Sustainability Report, highlighting the progress we are making on our 2030 goals. These goals are supported by investments we are making in polymer centers, the Blue Polymers joint venture, renewable natural gas projects and fleet electrification.I will now turn the call over to Brian, who will provide details for the quarter.Brian M. DelGhiaccioThanks, Jon. Core price on total revenue was 7.3%. Core price on related revenue was 8.8%, which included open market pricing of 11% and restricted pricing of 5.3%. The components of core price on related revenue included small container of 12.3%, large container of 8.8% and residential of 8.3%. Average yield on total revenue was 5.9%, and average yield on related revenue was 7.1%. We continue to price new and existing business ahead of cost inflation to drive margin expansion in the underlying business.Volume on total revenue increased 40 basis points while volume on related revenue increased 50 basis points. The components of volume on related revenue included an increase in small container of 1.4%, an increase in residential of 80 basis points, and an increase in landfill of 3.7%. Landfill was primarily driven by an 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. Volume growth was partially offset by a decrease in large container of 1.3%, primarily due to a slowdown in construction-related activity.Moving on to recycling. Commodity prices were $119 per ton during the quarter. This compared to $218 per ton in the prior year. Recycling processing and commodity sales decreased revenue by 1.1% during the quarter. Current commodity prices are approximately $115 per ton. We believe commodity prices will remain relatively flat with current levels in the second half of the year. And we now expect average recycled commodity prices in a range of $110 to $115 per ton for the full year.Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business. Second quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $104 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. On a same-store basis, Environmental Solutions contributed 20 basis points to internal growth during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the Environmental Solutions business was 22.5%, a sequential increase of more than 150 basis points. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 30% during the quarter. Margin performance included a 50 basis point decrease from recycled commodity prices and a 30 basis point decrease from acquisitions, which was fully overcome by a 100 basis point increase from net fuel and margin expansion in the underlying business of 20 basis points.Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $1.26 billion. Our performance through the first half benefited from the timing of capital expenditures and cash taxes. Year-to-date capital expenditures of $550 million represents 33% of our projected full year spend and year-to-date adjusted cash taxes of $99 million represents 40% of our projected full year spend. Total debt was $12.2 billion, and total liquidity was $2.1 billion. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter returned to approximately 3x.With respect to taxes, our combined tax rate and effects from solar investments resulted in an equivalent tax impact of 26.8% during the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. We expect an equivalent tax impact of 25% in the second half of the year resulting in a full year equivalent tax impact of approximately 25.5%.With that, operator, I would like to open the call to questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bryan Burgmeier of Citi.Bryan Nicholas BurgmeierOn the Blue Polymer announcement this morning, is that something that's already captured in the pro forma earnings from polymer centers that you've spoken about previously? Or is this going to be incremental? And if it is incremental, could you give us a sense of the potential earnings impact?Jon Vander ArkNo, it's incremental. So think about that polymer center producing 2 things, PET on one side and olefins on the other side. The PET, we take into a flight, basically, a hot wash Queen flake that's food grade that can go right back into water bottle manufacturing or other types of PET applications. On the olefins, it takes a slightly different path. So we sort, get full collection of that olefins and then we feed the polymer center. So this basically guarantees the demand on the back end of our polymer center for the olefin side of it.And then Ravago was world-class at compounding and blending olefins to create unique products. And so that's why we partnered with them. We think we can provide the right applications to the market. We get to participate -- not only do we get the supply, so it's a supply agreement on one side, we get to participate in the benefit and the upside as a 45% minority JV partner.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. From an economics perspective, we look at our equity pickup, that one line pickup, beginning in '26 2 centers somewhat contributing in that year with about $15 million. So you can think $7 million to $8 million per center. And then getting $7 million to $8 million incremental in both '27 and '28. Ultimately, we see $30 million to $32 million worth of EBITDA for all 4 at run rate in 2029.Bryan Nicholas BurgmeierAnd if I can just maybe follow up on the recycling business. I think your filings say your volume is about 80% fiber. Once the polymer centers are online, do you think that 80% fiber exposure drops a bit? Or is there may be a different way we should start to think about value versus volume?Jon Vander ArkYes. Look, initially, it won't drop much, at least from a volume standpoint, because what we're really doing with polymer center is taking things that are down cycle today and some material along the way in that down cycling is lost and landfilled to get full volume recovery out of that plastic and get much higher yield because they're driving true circularity.Now these polymer centers are built actually to take third-party product over time. So over time, we'll flow third-party product in there. That will put more plastic into the system and then dilute the fiber percentage right at a certain level, but you're probably talking more like going from 80 to 75 versus a major change in the mix.OperatorYour next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.Toni Michele KaplanYou mentioned a couple of comments on volume, and I was just wondering if volume was sort of in line with what you were expecting or if it was a little bit lighter. And I know you mentioned the construction activity and the special waste was something mentioned by one of your competitors is slowing. I know here, you got the 8.3% increase in special waste revenue. But just anything on volume trends and where things are above or below what you were expecting and how you think for the rest of the year?Jon Vander ArkYes. I'd say broadly kind of in line with expectation, probably slightly ahead in certain areas. So construction, we anticipated that being down. We saw residential and commercial starts obviously start to soften the second half of last year. And there's a lag effect as we have jobs that are getting completed. And so we're down 3.8%, but we have really strong pricing there. So we've taken the opportunity there to stay disciplined on price and making sure that we're getting a positive mix even in that environment.And then other special waste, right, is attractive. Part of that special waste clearly is our cross-sell initiatives with the US Ecology acquisition. But we have now a unique offering in the marketplace, and we're seeing customers demand to that unique offering. So that's certainly helping us. Small container was a bright spot, right, in terms of volume growth for the quarter. So I feel really good about that as well. And again, I'd say broadly in line with what we expected.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. And Toni, if you remember, in our original guidance, the range on volume was 50 basis points to 1% positive. And now we're thinking it's at that -- still within the range, but at the lower end. But at the same time, we increased our guidance on average yields, right? So the flow-through and the contribution of a 50 basis point increase on yield is much more significant to the enterprise in our results than the 50 basis point decrease on the volume side.Toni Michele KaplanAnd then you mentioned the partnership with Coca-Cola. Can you talk about potential impacts from that? It might be a little bit longer term, but just any thoughts on how to quantify how you're thinking about that partnership and the benefits to you?Jon Vander ArkYes, Coca-Cola has been a great partner. I would say this, demand for our product out of the polymer center outstrip supply by a lot, right? So we were able to talk to a number of parties. We could have sold the Las Vegas center out 3 or 4 times over without challenges because the market is so short supplied for this type of ARPA that's food grade. And we're taking it right now, the single site over time, we'll take the Midwest side. And then these partnerships will evolve, and I'm certain they'll grow, right, as we expand the network, but that's all we're disclosing at this point.OperatorThe next question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James.Patrick Tyler BrownBrian, just real quick from a modeling perspective, what is the expected contribution from M&amp;A in the new revenue guidance? I think it was supposed to be maybe a 3% contributor coming into the year. Is it may be closer to 3.5% to 4%? And then how much rolls into '24 based on what we know today?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. So the in-year contribution rollover from '22 transactions as well as the in-year impact from '23 transactions, we're thinking 4.25%, right? And the rollover impact into '24, right, from the deals that were completed in '23, we think adds 50 basis points to our '24 revenue growth.Patrick Tyler BrownAnd then -- so I just kind of want to think about the EBITDA a little bit. So it looks like you raised EBITDA by, call it, $50 million. But if I'm not mistaken, you actually lowered your commodity assumption, but then you added in some M&amp;A. So basically, I'm trying to bridge that change. How much of the EBITDA change was basically core versus some other moving pieces, if that makes sense at all.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Let me answer the question. The short story is that the entire increase is essentially the underlying business. So let me go through some of the puts and takes. So to your point, right, we've added EBITDA associated with acquisitions, but most of those acquisitions were completed midyear. So you're going to half the contribution. We've also got deal and integration costs. Two of these deals require regulatory filings, so we had heavy legal costs. We also have a fairly significant integration costs just because one of those deals requires that we re-brand the trucks within the first 6 months. So the contributions from acquisitions in here is still positive, but it's somewhat muted. To your point, that's been further offset by the reduction in recycled commodity prices. So if you think about taking all those things I just mentioned relative to our original guide, it's a relative push. The $50 million increase in EBITDA at the midpoint is essentially the increase in price flowing through to the bottom line.Patrick Tyler BrownPerfect. Okay. That's what I thought. Just real quick on the last one here. So if we just exclude Blue Polymer and we just look at the Vegas facility, what is the expected EBITDA impact of that facility in '24? And then how dependent will it be on recycled plastic prices because we have seen some weakness there recently. And basically, sorry, does this Blue Polymer JV, does it kind of inoculate that offtake risk longer term? Am I thinking about all that right?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Let me go ahead and start. You had a couple of questions there, so we'll kind of unpack some of those. So the expected contribution from just the polymer center, right, so this is the one in Vegas in '24 is $15 million, right, of EBITDA contribution in '24. You can then think of about an incremental $20 million per year thereafter, right, as we bring other centers online, ultimately getting to about $80 million worth of EBITDA at run rate in 2028.To your other point, right, on the Blue Polymers, yes, we are going to be selling all of the olefins coming out of the polymer center 2, the Blue Polymers JV, right? So -- and when you start thinking about the offtake agreement there that guarantees, right, a contractual rate for all of those units leaving Blue Polymers on the olefin side -- or I'm sorry, polymer center on the olefin side.Patrick Tyler BrownOkay. Perfect. So it kind of helps inoculate the offtake longer term, if I read it right.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Correct.OperatorThe next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.Jerry David RevichJon, I'm wondering if you could just expand on comments you recently made to the Wall Street Journal. You spoke about having visibility on double-digit top line growth here in the medium term. I'm wondering if you could just unpack what gives visibility on that between polymer, M&amp;A yield, other moving pieces? And in that type of top line environment, do you think you can still deliver the 2x leverage between revenue and earnings that Republic has done over the past decade?Jon Vander ArkYes. We're certainly starting with price, right? That's always the first component, right? We have to price ahead of our costs. You've seen the organic growth picture. And the underlying solid waste and recycling business is a slow growth business, right? And we expect to grow slightly faster than the market, only slightly because it's a highly contracted market and shares don't move easily. And again, we're always going to stay disciplined on price first.As we've expanded into Environmental Solutions, the underlying growth from an organic standpoint is certainly a little stronger. So that's a tailwind. On the growth side, we're doing more M&amp;A than we ever had. It was 6 or 7 years ago, we talked about spending $100 million a year in M&amp;A, right? And then that's been ramped up to $500 million to $700 million, and obviously, we had announced last year the US Ecology acquisition and got to $3 billion. But even outside of US Ecology, it's $800 million of deals outside of US Ecology. And this year, we've said more than $1 billion, and we're already sniffing up against that number. So M&amp;A is certainly contributing.And then our other sustainability investments, right, are nice contributors and probably a little less on the top line in terms of really moving the needle given the scale of the business. But on the bottom line, right, these are kind of high EBITDA margin investment opportunities, very high return. So we feel great about that over time.Jerry David RevichAnd Brian, can I ask separately? In the quarter, really strong margin performance. Your COGS per unit were up just 3%. Any -- in terms of lumpy items that contributed to the results in the quarter? Or were the results pretty clean? It sounds like attrition was pretty low, but I'm wondering, were there any other moving pieces that helped margins or costs in the quarter that we should keep in mind before run rating the really strong results?Brian M. DelGhiaccioLook, I would say there's always some puts and takes. But I would say if you aggregate those from a net number perspective, it was a fairly clean quarter.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel.Michael Edward HoffmanBrian, could we walk through a dollar reconciliation of last year's EBITDA to this year's EBITDA on a dollar basis, so not just the aggregate change, the 50, but what are all the puts and takes? Because I think have the sense that we're understating the power of solid waste by just saying 50. This is on the guide. Sorry, I meant the guide.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes, the guide. So Michael, as I mentioned, I mean, we're not going to get into the individual components of the EBITDA contribution of our acquisitions and other things. But what I can tell you is, as I just said with Tyler on the phone, if you take a look at the in-year acquisition contribution net of those deal and integration costs, right, that is a positive number, which is almost entirely offset by the reduction in recycled commodities. That reduction in recycled commodities is about $15 million to $20 million negative compared to our original expectations.So if you look at guide to guide right at the midpoint, our EBITDA is up $50 million, which is the underlying business made up primarily of relatively higher price. We took our yield from 5.5% on total revenue to 6%. We took it from 6.5% on related to 7%. So that's that 50 basis points as well as just outperformance within the Environmental Solutions business. That's what's contributing, right, to the overall increase in EBITDA.Michael Edward HoffmanCould we then talk about Environmental Solutions, and would you talk about the price volume mix there because I think it's important for everybody to see that there's a combination of both in that the pricing of a scarce asset continues.Jon Vander ArkYes, let me start there, Michael. We're working through that. Obviously, it's a little bit like special waste in terms of there's a mix issue that there's a lot of unique products and services. So we haven't nailed yet what we might report externally in terms of price or yield metric there, certainly our aspiration over time, whether that's large parts of the business, like yield per drum or things like that, work through it. But a huge portion of the outperformance there is price. We've taken multiple double-digit price increases, and we will lead from a pricing standpoint. And that's caused a few units to be shed in certain places. So we found the ceiling, but we're unafraid. These are valuable assets, impossible to replicate and customers are valuing what we're offering. So we're going to continue to push on that front. And that, also combined with the cross-sell, which is where we're driving a lot of the volume, has been a really good story and picture for that business.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. I mean just to put some numbers on that, Michael. If you take a look at the Environmental Solutions business, this time last year, was 17.1% EBITDA margin, this quarter, 22.5%. So that 540 basis points of margin improvement is essentially most of that being price driven but also just better overall utilization as well. And we're becoming more efficient, and we're optimizing from a labor perspective. So when we do get those units, not just because of the price alone, but as far as the overall profitability of each one of those jobs, we're just becoming overall more efficient as we have better utilization of the assets and the resources that are providing those services.Michael Edward HoffmanIf I could just tease that one thing. We've had negative trends in ISM PMI, we're below 50 on the index. It looks like it's floor bottoming. But is there a positive volume even if I don't get the split, there's positive volume plus a lot of price?Jon Vander ArkYes. I think, yes. And so we look at all those indices, too, Michael. And I think what we're not fully accounting for is a lot of the infrastructure spend and the government spending is flowing through. And we're certainly getting a lot of opportunity there.Brian M. DelGhiaccioAnd I think the other thing, too, Michael, that we're also seeing right now as well is the benefit of the cross-sell. As we said, we've now increased -- or reported more than $110 million in new sales, which is positively impacting both the Environmental Solutions business as well as the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste business. But more of that positively impacting the Environmental Solutions business just because when you take a look at the revenue per customer tends to just be higher than we see in Recycling &amp; Solid Waste.Michael Edward HoffmanLet me squeeze one more, if I can. You raised price in 4Q, you raised it in 1Q. Did you raise it in 2Q as well?Brian M. DelGhiaccioWe are actually in the process of raising prices here early in 3Q.OperatorThe next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.Walter Noel SpracklinJust on the volume, good job on growing that volume amid some of your peers seeing it contract a little bit. But I'm just curious as to whether we're hearing a little bit on the price competition from smaller players that are somewhat less disciplined in that regard and some of your peers walking away from that business. Are you seeing any evidence that smaller players are acting a little bit more aggressive here? And do you suspect that this will ultimately translate in either pressure on pricing or on volumes for your business going forward?Jon Vander ArkNo, we haven't seen it. Now again, there's always an ankle biter and a market here or there who's going to take advantage of try to grow volume and figure out pretty quickly, right? That's a tough way to make a business and earn your cost of capital. With a small container, right, 9.5% yield, 1.4% volume. Really, really strong numbers for us this quarter. And that's a place we often see the price competition come in. That's where they try to attack because that's a profitable part of the business and people try to build their business there. They might start out on resi script or start out and temporal off and then they quickly get into that because that's the higher margin stuff. And so we've not seen the market broadly turn into a negative direction at all.Brian M. DelGhiaccioAnd the other thing, too, you have to remember is that there are still supply chain constraints on getting new trucks. So in order to sit there into, again, have that type of behavior, you'd have to have capacity in your system or be able to secure a new truck in order to service those new accounts. And we are not seeing those supply chain constraints easing anytime soon.Walter Noel SpracklinRight. Being a little bit of a natural limiter there. On the CapEx spend, we saw a few of your competitors, again, increase CapEx a little bit unexpectedly in certain cases. And just curious how you review your CapEx spend is -- and new projects as they develop? Are you -- have you looked at your budget for this year? Is that something you do on an ongoing basis? Is it upcoming? Are you seeing evidence of projects that perhaps weren't on the horizon or perhaps not in your purview that are starting to pop up? Just curious as to, on a time frame, when you might update your CapEx budget based on what projects might -- may or may not have come into the fold.Jon Vander ArkYes. No, we're doing that on an ongoing basis, right? We're looking at opportunities and polymer centers and Blue Polymer are good examples of things that we think if they're value-creating, sustainable investments over time, we're going to make those investments. But we think also about, hey, normal course of business, what is the budget and not having any big CapEx bubble. So in this year, for example, the supply chain is challenged on the truck side. And so we're able to pull forward a little bit of spend on heavy equipment this year and some of that truck spend then will flow into next year. So across the 2 years, it will be relatively balanced. So there's always a little bit of push, pull on the margin, but we're looking at it all the time. And then thinking about into next year, if there's things that are really value creating, we'll put those into the budget next year. But we're kind of giving you what we see in terms of Blue Polymer and polymer centers in terms of investments outside of that, including the landfill gas energy projects we've already talked about.Brian M. DelGhiaccioAnd if you look in the details of the guidance, when we do the reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow, included in that is a guide for the capital expenditures. And the number that's in there in the revised guide is exactly the same as what we guided back in February.Walter Noel SpracklinAnd last question here is on acquisitions. You had a couple of lumpy -- chunky ones in the quarter. Is it your intention now to digest a little bit as you go into 2024? Or is this something that you think you could keep up a fairly solid clip that even ex those chunkier acquisitions you would have done otherwise?Jon Vander ArkNo, pipeline remains strong, both on the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste and the Environmental Solutions side of the business. We're mindful of not loading up a specific geography, right, if they've done a big deal. We want to make sure that they can digest that and get that operational. But we've got a good pipeline of deals of all sizes, and we look forward to a strong second half and then into '24 as well.OperatorThe next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.Sean D. EastmanSo particularly in light of the way the EBITDA guidance raise was framed in terms of that pricing falling through to the bottom line and relative to the comments in response to Michael's question about raising prices successively each quarter. Just in light of those -- with those as context, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the underlying inflation in the business, how those trended through the quarter, how you're responding, how these pricing programs are responding to those trends?Jon Vander ArkSure. Yes. Different picture obviously. Labor has been a really good story for us in terms of we brought the turnover down, starting to see that inflation certainly modulate. Maintenance has been a little more of a challenge and it's twofold. Some of it's just the underlying tires or things and true inflation. The other is the challenge of the supply chain, right, while we're growing the business, right, and we're not getting the replacement trucks or the growth trucks we need at the exact clip, that's causing us to drive older trucks, and we're going to do that to service our customer and capture the opportunity. So it's still value creating, but it is going to show up in that maintenance line in terms of older trucks at higher maintenance cost on that front. But we expect broadly all the cost categories, we're starting to see that inflation modulate in the second half of the year. And so we should see pretty good price cost spread throughout the remainder of the year.Sean D. EastmanAnd then maybe taking that a little bit further. The -- just trying to think about the jumping off point for margins into next year, just assuming kind of status quo on some of the commodity-related inputs. I'm trying to think about the typical 30 to 50 basis points. Should we be building that number off of the second half outlook? As much information or thoughts as you can provide on that bridge would be really appreciated.Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Look, we're not providing guidance right now for '24. But again, if you -- when we talk about that kind of 30 to 40 basis points per year, we're doing if off a full year number. So again, if you take a look at the midpoint of the EBITDA and the midpoint of the revenue, you can get a baseline adjusted EBITDA margin and think of it off of that because we're saying this year is a relative -- we're expecting a relatively normal level of seasonality. We always expected it to follow the normal seasonal pattern from a margin profile perspective by quarter. So I think if you look at the full year number, that's a good baseline.OperatorThe next question comes from Lydia Young of Oppenheimer.Noah Duke KayeSorry, this is Noah Kaye on. Maybe we -- can just to make sure we understand, to put a finer point on the last question, how you think about kind of the yield and margin cadence for the back half. There's some odd comps, obviously, last year to consider versus what feels this year. As you said, more like normal seasonality. So can you maybe help us put a little bit of a finer point on it for modeling purposes?Brian M. DelGhiaccioWell -- and again, I would say it had more to do with the prior year than the current year. We always said this year, we expect more of a normal seasonality sequentially. And so again, when you take a look at -- in a normal year, your 2 best quarters tend to be Q2 and Q3 because you're capturing those summer months, right? And then again, you start pulling in some of the -- in the colder climates where some of the units start to step down, and that's why you see comparably lower margin performance, lower revenue, lower EBITDA in Qs 4 and 1. But as you kind of see this year and you kind of do the math, it looks like second half will be slightly more contribution than first half, kind of a 49.5%, 50.5% type contribution. And again, we would say that that's relatively in line with our original expectations.Noah Duke KayeAnd I think -- by the way, I take your point around higher flow-through on price versus volume and agree with it all day. And so part of just trying to better understand because I think there's been a theme to this earnings around what the volume environment actually looks like. So I just want to make sure I can reconcile something. I think that the guide basically implies flat volumes, right, for the back half. And as you said in your commentary, you're not really looking at a flat volume environment, you're still looking at growth. So just how do I reconcile those? Are you maybe just being a little bit conservative given some of the indicators? Just help us to make sense.Jon Vander ArkYes. It's just caution and conservatism, given the construction market, given obviously the manufacturing industry we talk about and just there's some general uncertainty out there have we really stuck the soft landing or not. So we want to be cognizant of that. Listen, we're still raising, right? We've got a great story to tell and very, very positive. But on the volume standpoint, we're just being conservative.OperatorThe next question is from David Manthey of Baird.David John MantheyQuestion on Environmental Solutions. In broad strokes, can you outline what that segment might look like in 5 years based on your strategy today?Jon Vander ArkYes, we expect to keep growing. And this question comes up often, what percentage of the mix is going to be, right? We don't have a target percentage mix. I can tell you that we also plan on growing the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste side of the business. And so whether that is 12%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 1 year might be outsized one or the other, but we expect it to contribute. And the most important thing for us is it's related, right? It's the thing that's helping us drive cross-sell and stickiness with our customers, not just on the ES side of the business, but in the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste side of the business.So same formula there. We're going to start with price, right? We're going to look to gain organic growth, right, and grow some basis points ahead of the market, but not wildly ahead of the market. And then have a strong M&amp;A pipeline, but stay very disciplined in terms of double-digit returns and make sure that any deal we do there fits our strategy.David John MantheyAnd second, I guess someone has to ask about PFAS. So with your current Environmental Solutions capabilities, is PFAS remediation a net positive opportunity today for Republic? Or do you need other pieces to make it that way?Jon Vander ArkSo we see it as a positive. And again, this is not -- there's -- laws are still evolving here and the regulations are. And so we're actively having discussions at a federal, state and local level, right, to make sure that we're not -- and the industry broadly, right, isn't the one holding the bag or they should want us to take care of PFAS because we're the one collecting it. We didn't generate it or create it. So we're going to be mindful that we're not penalized because we're doing the right thing from the environment. And then you flip that on the ES side of the business, lots of opportunities already emerging and lots of customer discussions for how we remediate. We have some solutions today, that portfolio is going to grow. So we think this is a net positive for us.OperatorYour next question comes from Tobey Sommer of Truist Securities.Tobey O'Brien SommerCan you keep this pace of margin expansion in ES into 2024? And where is the ultimate end goal? Maybe speak to the drivers from this low 20% range.Jon Vander ArkYes. The ultimate end goal is to harmonize the financial profile of this business with the Recycling &amp; Solid Waste side of the business. We think we first will get their free cash flow conversion because over the cycle, this side of the business has a little less capital intensity and then ultimately margin. We're going to get there in a very disciplined way, right? You won't see the pace of the margin expansion, right, 540 basis points, that's leaps and bounds. We're not going to keep this pace. But I think you're going to see steady progress on that front.And listen, there will be some movement in this business like there is as the economy ebbs and flows, but we're going to take a through-cycle mindset, continue to serve customers, stay disciplined, focus on people who are generating recurring revenue over time. And I think you'll see the financial profile harmonize over time in the 2 sides of the business.Tobey O'Brien SommerHow much higher can you drive retention above the 94% level and still have it sort of be economically advantageous? And what's driving service delivery improvement now?Jon Vander ArkI'll start with the end of your question. Certainly, technology is helping us on that front. As we put in the RISE platform is just allowing -- positioning our frontline people to succeed every day. All the information with the customer is in front of them. When things come up like a block stop, they can immediately communicate digitally to our logistics department through our customer service. So we've got a full visibility and can communicate with the customer quickly. Turnover coming down is certainly helping that, and we feel good about that on the front line of the business.And I don't think we can drive loyalty to 100 because at some point, that's unattractive for certain customers who aren't willing to go or want to go from a price increase. And there is some natural movement of homes, closures of business, et cetera. But we don't think we're done yet. We aspire to take that 94 up higher.Tobey O'Brien SommerLast one for me. What are the puts and takes of multiple price hikes per annum as opposed to larger, less frequent price hikes?Jon Vander ArkWell, one would be test and learn, right? So when you put out the price increase, right, you can understand exactly how customers react and are we able to retain that work? And so that's the flexibility we have. Over time, you're not going to see us do that. Our normal case and recycling solid waste business is typically annual increases when extraordinary things happen like the commodity issue 4, 5 years ago, multiple price increases in a year, but that's not normal course. So over time, the ES business will matriculate to that model as well.OperatorThe next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreSticking on the move to the ES side and particularly the US Ecology deal. I mean, I think kind of everything that was laid out tonight kind of speaks to the strength you've seen, whether it's pricing or the cross-selling. So suffice it to say, is that $75 million to $100 million revenue synergy target, presumably, we've blown past that at this point? Do you have a new target? Or how would you think about kind of ultimately the opportunity you can continue to garner from a cross-selling and pricing standpoint and what that means for that original target?Jon Vander ArkYes. Listen, the pipeline is strong. Ultimately, this will manifest itself in our guidance for 2024, which we're not talking about today, but that will roll, right? And again, US Ecology, which was a great company. We were lucky to acquire, most importantly, the people, but also those assets. They're now part of the Republic Services in the Environmental Solutions business, so we've anniversaried that going forward. And so you'll see that roll through our volume numbers as we forecast 2024.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreAnd then maybe switching gears. Can you provide us an update on the joint venture with the BP and on the RNG front, maybe any updates or how it's progressing thus far?Jon Vander ArkYes. It's progressing about 57 projects and partnership. The largest chunk of that is with BP. It's 40-plus projects of those are with BP. And listen, we're hitting our marks broadly. Now there's certainly been some push-pull across individual locations where we've had some capital delays in being able to get facilities built. But then we've had other places where we've been able to redirect and pull forward faster and get that permitting in place.So ultimately, we're meeting our expectations for what's going to come online by the end of this year. And I think that's a helpful part of our portfolio, given the number of sites where you have 1 or 2 sites that might run into a little bit of delays. You've got the opportunity to look to accelerate other places.Stephanie Lynn Benjamin MooreSo maybe any volatility we've seen with RINs this year and nothing -- that really doesn't have any in impact with kind of your expectations for this year and next just given the structure of the JV? Is that kind of a fair assessment? Or how would you talk about company volatility?Brian M. DelGhiaccioFrom a long-term planning, and we talked about how we were valuing these investments, we assume $2 RIN prices through cycle. So the more recent uptick in RINs prices will actually be upside to our original expectations.OperatorThe next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America.Michael J. FenigerJust, Brian, the M&amp;A rollover you said next year is 50 basis points. I think typically, M&amp;A ends up being margin dilutive, but some of the acquisitions look like nice assets like Colorado. Just on that 50 bps next year, is there any chance that M&amp;A isn't margin diluted that it could be neutral or even accretive based on some of the assets you guys were able to purchase?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. On a majority of that 50 basis point rollover, we would expect that to be at the margin plus.Michael J. FenigerAnd I guess just for my second question, free cash flow is tracking well. I think the conversion is going to be that 44% range in line with last year. I guess with all the conversations about sustainability investments and these projects, just do you think that free cash flow conversion is going to plateau? Or is there an opportunity for next year, for '24, to see that break out a little bit and step up? What are some things that we should consider that might maybe hold that back or potential upside for that into next year?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. Well, a couple of things. So I mean your observation of relatively flat with '22. Be mindful though that we're overcoming over 300 basis points worth of headwinds between higher cash interest rates, commodity prices and the impact of bonus depreciation. So the underlying business is actually offsetting all of that to drive a result that looks relatively flat. That said, the contribution as we start thinking about the RNG plants and we think about polymer centers, Blue Polymers, all of which would be accretive to current company performance, that should all be additive. And as long as we don't continue to experience these year-over-year headwinds like we did this year in those 3 areas I just mentioned, you should start to see that flow through.Michael J. FenigerAnd Brian, just maybe just the last one. Just when I look at the open versus restricted pricing, obviously very healthy. How do we kind of think of those moving parts as we go into second half? And any visibility we kind of have in the first half next year just based on how we do the look backs?Brian M. DelGhiaccioYes. So again, when we think about open market pricing, and we've said this all along that we expected relatively higher pricing in the first half as compared to the second half, not really a function of what we're doing in the current year, it just we'd start getting into tougher comps. And again, it's a year-over-year comparison, so expressed as a percentage. You start to see that modulate a little bit. But again, all staying within, call it, 50 basis points of the full year guide. So it steps down a little bit.Within the restricted, as we look forward, depends really on the pricing mechanism. So while we see potentially some of the CPI escalators, right, sequentially start to step down, water sewer trash and garbage track are doing the exact opposite. Each month, they tend to improve. So again, we see it being relatively consistent in the restricted portion of the book just because what we see in step downs in CPI being offset again by those alternative indices.OperatorThe next question comes from Kevin Chiang of CIBC.Kevin ChiangMaybe just one for me. I'm just wondering when you think of ES margins from the low 20s to eventually 30%, it sounds like pricing is tracking well. You've got the cross-selling opportunities. Just you had good success rolling on technology, automation, a bunch of things that have helped improve your solid waste margins. Just wondering how many of those initiatives you've rolled into ES. Or maybe how many of those initiatives would be applicable in the ES segment that could help bridge that gap? And is there a way to maybe quantify how much that could be to margins if you roll out some of that technology to the Environmental Solutions business?Jon Vander ArkYes. No, it's a great question. Right now, that's all costs, no benefit. So we're investing a lot in IT and doing a lot of hard integration work. US Ecology, but also ACV and a lot of the legacy assets we have all in the common platform, starting with a customer, how do we make that service offering even more compelling by getting digitally integrated with them. And then there's certainly some things on the operating side of the business, which will also help us drive labor utilization, more efficiency in terms of material flow, et cetera. We haven't quantified exactly what that's worth yet, but that will be part of the path to get to the 30. And when we get a little further down the road, we'll talk about those initiatives in more detail.OperatorThe next question comes from Stephanie Yee of JPMorgan.Stephanie L. YeeI want to ask about the polymer centers. So the Las Vegas, Midwest and the 2 others that you're planning to build, is 4 kind of the gating factor because of how much plastics you're actually collecting in your recycling routes? Or if there is a lot of demand, would you consider investing in more than 4 facilities?Jon Vander ArkYes. Four was -- the business case we based it off of was all the maturity we collect today. So we don't have supply risk, which is great. Now we built those centers with a capacity to take third-party volume, and we're already getting some of that. So we've created a broker that's already starting to capture some third-party volume, and it's a great value proposition. For example, if you have a municipally owned recycling center, we can take labor out of your facility, right, give you a few more -- penny for that load, and it's part of your sustainability story as well. So you share in the environmental benefits of that.Over time, right, as that demand for third party continues to grow, we could imagine 5 or 6 centers. it's regionally based, all hub-and-spoke model. So we've got the flexibility in the network over time that if the demand outstrips the capacity of the 4, that we'll continue to invest.Stephanie L. YeeAnd just on the Blue Polymers JV, can you give us an idea of the CapEx spend that would be coming from Republic? Or is it too early at this point?Brian M. DelGhiaccioRemember, it's more -- we're a minority owner, so it's more an investment then it will come through CapEx. But we're thinking that our allocable share would be about $40 million per facility or $160 million in total over the next 5 to 6 years.OperatorAt this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jon Vander Ark for any closing remarks.Jon Vander ArkThank you, Andrea.

(NYSE:RSG) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.535 on the 13th of October, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.4%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Republic Services Republic Services' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Based on the last payment, Republic Services was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 30.7%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 34%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendRepublic Services Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.94 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.14. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 8.6% per annum over that time. Dividends have grown at a reasonable rate over this period, and without any major cuts in the payment over time, we think this is an attractive combination as it provides a nice boost to shareholder returns.The Dividend's Growth Prospects Are LimitedSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings has been rising at 3.9% per annum over the last five years, which admittedly is a bit slow. The company has been growing at a pretty soft 3.9% per annum, and is paying out quite a lot of its earnings to shareholders. This isn't necessarily bad, but we wouldn't expect rapid dividend growth in the future.Story continuesRepublic Services Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Republic Services is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For instance, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Republic Services that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Non-COVID segments saw 5% growth, but that isn't enough for the company to maintain a strong 2023 outlook.The company reduced the upper end of its guidance by $1 billion, for a new range of $67 billion to $70 billion for 2023, and reduced from 7%-9% growth (non-COVID) to 6%-8%.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla acknowledged the uncertainty of waning demand for COVID products but said it wouldn't last.""We are all almost in agreement that the uncertainty of COVID — which is there and it is real and it is quite significant — will disappear by the end of the year,"" he told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday.""Whatever will be the vaccination rates this fall ... and whatever will be the treatment and infection rates for COVID this fall, there is no reason to think that that will not be repeated in the years to come,"" Bourla added.""When we come to some certainty of what COVID will be ... even if it is very little, still remains a strong product in our pipeline,"" Bourla said.CFO David Denton said he knows analysts have been waiting to see how the company performs outside of the pandemic, which is why it didn't get a boost in recent years despite the COVID windfall.""Our cost structure and our investment focus will be aligned to the revenue going forward, so that people can get comfort that we have levers to pull financially so that we ... can make sure we deliver financially on our promise to investors,"" Denton said.Men walk by Pfizer headquarters, Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Beyond COVIDBeyond COVID, the company is working on building up its pipeline as it faces patent cliffs for some of its products. That is what drove its acquisition of Seagen (SGEN), which is still in the works awaiting Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance. Denton said once that deal closes it should also help with investor confidence.Story continuesPfizer has received six FDA approvals so far this year and expects another half dozen through the rest of the year.One of those approved is its RSV vaccine for adults ages 60 and older, the demand for which will be tested in the upcoming cold and flu season.That, in addition to mixed revenue on some of Pfizer's top products, is why JPM analysts called Tuesday's report ""mixed.""""Overall, we view today’s update as a mixed one for (Pfizer). On one hand, new product guidance is coming in below expectations for 2023, and (Pfizer) is acknowledging a highly uncertain COVID outlook. On the other, the company appears willing to adjust its cost base to better match its revenue output in the event COVID sales do not live up to expectations,"" the firm said in a note to clients.Medicare drug negotiationsPfizer's focus on its pipeline comes at a time when the industry is awaiting a list of target drugs that Medicare will negotiate prices for as part of its new powers under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).Big pharma firms like Merck (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) have independently sued the US Health Department, calling the law unconstitutional. They claim the law is an unfair way for the government to set prices. In addition to the companies, the US Chamber of Commerce and lobbying firm PhRMA have also filed separate suits.Pfizer has not filed on its own but is a member of some of the other organizations. Bourla said he agrees with the other companies that the law is going to hurt innovation — a common refrain among critics.""They will hurt innovation and they are already having a damaging impact on some of the decisions companies are making,"" Bourla said. ""It's going to kill a lot of small biotech companies,"" he added.While Pfizer hasn't filed a suit independently, the option is still on the table.""We retain all our rights to do what we think is appropriate,"" Bourla said.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhem.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Revenue from its COVID-19 treatment molnupiravir declined 83%. Revenue from other products grew 14%, and Merck upgraded its guidance by $800 million for the year.Though its acquisition of Prometheus is a long-term positive, having to declare the transaction all in the second quarter was what resulted in the negative impact, according to the company.But the quarter was boosted by sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, up 19%, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil, up 47% due to strong demand in China— which accounted for 39% of the total growth. Both results beat Wall Street expectations for the quarter.Keytruda is a key driver for Merck's continued growth, even as it faces patent expiry in 2028.The company is preparing for competition from biosimilars, but doesn't expect it will grow at the current pace. Merck, like other big pharmaceutical companies, has been dealing with the impact of patent expirations in the past few years.The company sees upside for two new drugs in 2024: sotatercept, a drug it gained from its $11.5 billion acquisition of Acceleron Pharma in late 2021, and a second approval attempt for gefapixant, a chronic cough treatment. Both are in various stages of FDA review.A Merck scientist conducts research on Feb. 28, 2013, in West Point, Pa. (Matt Rourke/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)IRA litigationMerck is one of a handful of large pharmaceutical companies that have independently sued the US Health Department (HHS) over the Medicare drug pricing powers in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).Merck called the law unconstitutional, citing similar concerns as other plaintiffs: that the government is setting prices without allowing any recourse for companies.During the earnings call Tuesday, CEO Robert Davis addressed the lawsuit saying the company isn't entirely against the law itself.Story continues""We’ve consistently communicated our support for elements of the law that improve patient affordability and access, such as the Medicare Part D reform, but which do so without damaging the very promising long-term innovation potential of the biopharmaceutical industry,"" Davis said.He added that Merck believes the drug pricing negotiations ""amount to unconstitutional price setting that violates several provisions of the US Constitution. This misguided policy does not strike the right balance between incenting investment in innovation and improving affordability and access.""Davis ended his comments saying that Merck is willing to work with the US government to find a better approach.Merck was the first to file a lawsuit, followed by Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY).

In the year-ago period, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.87. The reported loss was due to a one-time charge incurred by the company to acquire Prometheus Biosciences, completed in June.Including acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities and certain other items, loss per share was $2.35. In the year-ago period, Merck reported earnings of $1.55.Revenues rose 3% year over year (7% on a constant currency basis) to $15.04 billion. Sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.39 billion.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $13.46 billion, up 6% (8% excluding Fx impact) year over year, as higher sales of oncology drugs and vaccines more than offset the lower sales of Merck’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) and diabetes medicines. Excluding Lagevrio, Pharmaceutical sales grew 14%.Keytruda, the largest product in Merck’s portfolio, generated sales of $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19% (21% excluding Fx impact) year over year. Keytruda sales gained from continued strong momentum in metastatic indications, including in some types of NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC and MSI-H cancers, and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Keytruda sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.87 billion and our estimate of $5.69 billion.Alliance revenues from Lynparza and Lenvima also boosted oncology sales in the quarter. Merck has a deal with British pharma giant AstraZeneca AZN to co-develop and commercialize PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, and a similar one with Japan’s Eisai for its tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima.Alliance revenues from AstraZeneca-partnered Lynparza increased 13% (15%, excluding Fx impact) year over year to $310 million in the quarter, driven by increased demand. Lenvima alliance revenues were $242 million, up 5% from the year-ago period’s levels.Story continuesIn the hospital specialty portfolio, neuromuscular blockade medicine, Bridion injection generated sales of $502 million in the quarter, up 18% year over year, driven by increased demand and market share.In vaccines, sales of HPV vaccines — Gardasil and Gardasil 9 — rose 47% year over year to $2.46 billion, driven by strong demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. Gardasil sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.99 billion and our estimate of $1.71 billion.Proquad, M-M-R II and Varivax vaccines recorded combined sales of $582 million, up 1% year over year. Sales of the rotavirus vaccine, Rotateq were down 25% to $131 million while Pneumovax 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent) vaccine sales declined 40% to $92 million. Sales of Vaxneuvance, Merck’s new pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine, were $168 million compared with $106 million in the previous quarter, driven by continued uptake in the pediatric group.Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales were down 30% year over year to $864 million. The drug sales were hurt by lower demand and pricing in the United States and generic competition in certain international markets. The drugs lost market exclusivity in China and the European Union last year.The company’s COVID-19 drug, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) generated sales of $203 million during the second quarter, down 83% year over year. Lower sales in Japan and no sales in the United Kingdom hurt Lagevrio sales. Lagevrio sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $155 million but missed our estimates of $221 million.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.46 billion, down 1% year over year (up 2% excluding Fx impact). Animal Health segment sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 billion.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin was 76.6%, up 190 basis points year over year, driven by the favorable impact of product mix and lower sales of Lagevrio, a low-margin product.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $2.6 billion in the reported quarter, up 8% year over year due to higher administrative costs and higher promotional spending.Adjusted research and development (R&amp;D) spending was $13.3 billion, compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago period, due to a one-time charge of $10.2 billion related to theacquisition of Prometheus Biosciences.2023 Guidance UpdatedMerck raised its sales outlook for 2023. The company expects revenues to be in the range of $58.6-$59.6 billion in 2023 compared with $57.7-$58.9 billion previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $58.7 billion.Lagevrio is expected to generate $1.0 billion in sales in 2023, a significant decline from $5.7 billion in 2022.The adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 77% (maintained).Following the completion of the $10.2 billion acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences in June, the company updated its operating expense and earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the full year.Adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $2.95 and $3.05 after accounting for a charge of $4.02 per share incurred by Merck for the Prometheus acquisition. Prior to the acquisition completion, the company expected adjusted EPS to be between $6.88 and $7.00. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.89 per share.Adjusted operating costs are expected to be in the range of $34.0 to $34.6 billion versus the prior expectation of $23.3 to $24.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is now expected to be approximately 30.5% to 31.5% (previously: 17% to 18%).Our TakeMerck’s second-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales. Strong sales of key products cancer drug, Keytruda and Gardasil vaccine drove the top line in the quarter. Merck also raised its full-year sales profit outlook, citing strong global underlying demand for its key products.Merck also expects that charges related to the Prometheus acquisition and the slightly higher impact of currency should be partially offset by a better operational performance. In this regard, management also raised the EPS guidance by 24 cents, attributable to additional business growth.Shares of Merck were up 1.4% in pre-market trading, supported by the better-than-expected earnings results and the guidance increase.In the year so far, the stock has lost 3.9% against the industry’s 2.6% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMerck has also made meaningful progress in its pipeline in the past year. Alongside partner Moderna MRNA, Merck initiated a phase III study last month evaluating its personalized cancer vaccine mRNA-4157/V940in melanoma indication. The initiation of this study was based on positive data from a phase IIb study, which previously achieved its primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival. This June, Moderna/Merck reported that additional data from this study which showed that treatment with mRNA-4157 led to a statistically significant and clinical improvement in distant metastasis-free survival, a key secondary endpoint of the study.Following the Prometheus acquisition, Merck added PRA023, a humanized monoclonal antibody, to its pipeline. PRA023 is currently being developed in mid-stage studies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and other autoimmune conditions.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

The results got a lift from surging profits from name-brand drugs. Pfizer, on the other hand, reported a decline in revenues due to falling demand for COVID-19 vaccines. Yahoo Finance Health Care Reporter Anjalee Khemlani breaks down the earnings data from the two pharma giants.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]- We have earnings from pharmaceutical giants Merck and Pfizer here this morning. So let's talk about what they reported with our Anjalee Khemlani, who covers health care. Anjalee, what stands out to you from these two companies?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, definitely a lot on the table for both companies. As you mentioned, both really big, but I think what's really interesting is the impact of the COVID decline in demand on both companies.Let's start off with Merck, which reported a 3% increase in revenue, but that is-- ex-covid is 14% increase, which is pretty huge. They've also upgraded their guidance by about $800 million for the year. And let's not forget they also acquired Prometheus, so that has had an impact on their quarter. And in addition, for the rest of the year, they did bring in $15 billion in revenues.Interesting to see that decline, like I mentioned, on the COVID product. They specifically only have the treatment, which saw an 83% decline. Meanwhile positives are Keytruda and Gardasil really driving the profits there. Gardasil is that HPV vaccine. They actually saw strong demand XUS. So you're looking in China, for example, a really strong market for them. And then their blockbuster, of course, Keytruda.They do have that LOE in 2028, so that loss of exclusivity that they're expecting. And they are prepared for that generic competition then, and that sort of is where Prometheus fits into that pipeline. So that small amount of impact from both the COVID part and the acquisition is kind of what's weighing on them today.Meanwhile Pfizer-- we know they are the number one for that COVID vaccine and as well as the treatment. A lot of impact there, 53% revenue decline, again, because of such a strong year last year based on just the COVID product. So without that, they've seen a bit of an increase there in the revenues. And they did have to reduce the outlook for 2023, so that has been something that the analysts have looked at when it comes to what that means.Story continuesIt's a reduction, of course, based on COVID, but also we saw them kind of trying to boost their pipeline for the short term with CGEN and that big acquisition. So they're also looking at long term what their pipeline is going to look like.So all told really-- a mixed quarter for Pfizer. A strong quarter for Merck, broadly speaking. And also another note for Pfizer, they did get their approval for their RSV vaccine for 60 and older, but they're seeing possibly a little bit less of a market than they expected based on what they think the CDC is going to guide for it.So while they do see more approvals anticipated for the second quarter, it's still looking, like you saw on your screen just now, a little bit mixed for Pfizer, but good news for Merck.- Yeah, definitely we'll continue to watch them. Anjalee Khemlani, Thank you so much for giving us the big picture on those two stocks.]"

So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.Story continuesBlake D. MoretThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We saw good double-digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter as component shortages continue to ease. Lead times also continued to reduce across our product lines with recovery to pre-pandemic lead times expected for all products by the end of the calendar year. We did miss almost a week of planned shipments in May because of a longer-than-expected changeover to a new third-party logistics supplier at our North American distribution center. Shipments from this distribution center recovered in June and we now have higher capacity in place for Q4 fiscal year '24 and beyond. Both total and organic sales grew over 13% versus prior year with currency and acquisitions roughly netting each other out. Currency translation decreased sales by less than 1 point and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up 8% versus prior year. The changeover in our distribution center had the biggest impact on this segment in the quarter. Within the Intelligent Devices segment, Independent Cart Technology continues to be a disruptive technology, and we had several more strategic material handling wins in the U.S. this quarter. The recent launch of our On-Machine ArmorKinetix motion control products adds to our innovative material handling portfolio. We also had an important win in Europe with SIDEM, one of the world's leading desalination companies where our PowerFlex drives and services expertise are helping this customer deliver economical and sustainable drinking water to millions of people in developing regions. Software &amp; Control organic sales grew over 24% year-over-year. Logix sales were almost 40% this quarter, reflecting the strong differentiation of our control platform and the continued benefits from supply chain resiliency investments we've made over the last year. Another example of our many ways to win within Software &amp; Control is recent success at a well-known global parcel delivery company, where the combination of our awesome industrial PCs ThinManager and View software unseated a long-standing competitor as the customer standardizes its North America facilities on a Rockwell visualization platform. Lifecycle Services organic sales increased 8% versus prior year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.08, led by strong orders in Sensia and our services business. Sensia had another good quarter of orders and sales with multiple large deals across EMEA and Asia. We also delivered higher sequential margins in Lifecycle Services this quarter. Information Solutions &amp; Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. We had multiple wins across our entire Information Solutions portfolio in Q3 and including both our on-prem and cloud-native software. This quarter, one of the world's top tire manufacturers located in Asia Pacific, selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk production center to develop its new global MES platform. Another important IS win in Asia was with a Japanese global leader in HVAC where our cloud-native Plex platform is being deployed on Microsoft Azure at one of their greenfield plants. The customer chose our SaaS solution to quickly start up a manufacturing execution and quality management system without the need for extensive on-premise hardware, software and support. We saw Plex synergy wins continue to ramp up in the quarter as our strong market access machine is contributing to new SaaS logos. In the quarter, we saw the benefits of our software partnership with PTC with numerous recurring revenue wins through a combination of our Digital Services business and PTC's ThingWorx visualization platform. Also regarding PTC, we continue to monetize the investment we made in 2018. We now own less than 5% of total shares outstanding and in accordance with the terms of our agreement, I am stepping off of their Board. Our commercial relationship remains strong and was extended in June. In Connected Services, we had an important cybersecurity win with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. This customer is leveraging our network of security services and expertise along with an intrusion detection system from our partner, Dragos, to help secure its network infrastructure and comply with cyber governance regulations. Our total annual recurring revenue grew a very strong 17% year-over-year this quarter. Segment margin of 21.1% was flat to last year and in line with our expectations despite the shipment shortfall. Adjusted EPS grew over 13% year-over-year. Backlog is beginning to reduce as lead times improve. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. Our discrete sales were up about 10% versus prior year. Within discrete, automotive sales grew mid-teens year-over-year. One of the notable customer wins here this quarter was with the Korean Tier 1 supplier working on an EV battery project for a European brand owner. This customer is using our core automation offerings, including motion control to provide tooling for battery thermal management. Another automotive win this quarter was with Jaguar Land Rover, where Rockwell was selected to support the JLR electrified architecture for 3 of their EV body shops in the U.K. Semiconductor sales grew high teens this quarter. Building on strength over the last few quarters, we continue to see broader adoption of our wafer transport solutions by the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers. This quarter, we also had an important Plex win in semiconductor at SOC, Saudi Arabia as the customer implements our smart manufacturing platform at its site in Riyadh. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, sales were down high teens versus prior year, driven by continued delays and some cancellations at our e-commerce customers. Moving to our hybrid industries segment. Sales in this segment grew 15% year-over-year. led by strong growth in food and beverage and tire. Food and beverage sales were up mid-teens versus prior year. We continue to see both greenfield and brownfield investments in this vertical with one of our most important multiyear wins this quarter focused on a customer's global fleet modernization program. A leading global food processing company is standardizing over 50 of its sites on our Plant PAx control platform. This competitive DCS win is a testament to our progress in process control applications in both technology and domain expertise. Life Sciences sales grew mid-single digits versus prior year. This industry continues to see strong investments in CapEx and OpEx projects across all regions both in traditional pharmaceuticals and newer advanced therapy medicinal products. We had a strategic win with Biosero, a member of the BICO Group in North America, where our combined technologies increase the speed and accuracy of new drug development. Biosero selected our Independent Cart Technology to automate lab workflows for a cell and gene therapy program. Tire was up over 35% in the quarter. Turning to Process Industries, Process sales were up 15% year-over-year, led by growth in oil and gas and mining. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. As I said earlier, our growth by region this quarter and for the full year fiscal year '23 reflects the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew about 2% year-over-year against higher comps. Latin America was up 7%. Through Q3, our orders in the Americas are outpacing the rest of the world. EMEA sales grew 34% and Asia Pacific was up over 44%. We did see an uptick in order cancellations in China this quarter. Let's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We are confident that shipments in the fourth quarter will recover the shortfall in Q3 caused by the distribution center change. Shipments in July were in line with our forecast for the full year. Our fiscal '23 guidance assumes a total reported sales growth range of 14% to 16%, and we continue to expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We now expect the impact from acquisitions and currency to offset each other. Nick will cover this in more detail later. We have said all along that we expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and constrained products improve, and that's what we are seeing right now. With improving lead times, machine builders do not need as many months of products on order and are no longer placing unusually large advance orders. Their incoming orders and frontlog remains strong and improving component lead times will help them improve their cash flow. We also expect distributor restock orders will pick up as they receive the last constrained items that allow them to clear their committed inventory and complete customer orders. Our order cancellation rates remain low. We now expect our full year fiscal year '23 orders to be in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range. Given this updated order outlook, we now expect to finish the year with about $4.5 billion to $5 billion in backlog, with about 80% of that backlog shippable in fiscal year '24. We expect organic ARR to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by 160 basis points year-over-year. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to grow 25% versus prior year. And we now expect 80% free cash flow conversion due to higher working capital. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?Nicholas C. GangestadThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 13.7% over last year. Q3 organic sales were up 13.2% and acquisitions contributed 120 basis points to total growth. Currency translator decreased sales by 70 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.1% and was in line with our expectations as improved productivity offset lower-than-expected sales. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price cost, partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and other expense was $32 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was below our expectations due to our shift in shipments from Q3 to Q4. Adjusted EPS grew 13% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.1% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow of $240 million was $87 million lower than prior year, driven by increases in working capital and income tax payments, partially offset by higher pretax income. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory. Inventory grew by 6 days, primarily in finished goods as a result of the shift in planned shipments from Q3 to Q4. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 220,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $62 million. On June 30, $1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales growth was led by Software &amp; Control, which grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin decreased by 290 basis points year-over-year due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by positive price cost. Segment margin for Software &amp; Control increased 340 basis points compared to last year, and higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher investment spend. We continue to accelerate top-line growth and profitability from acquisitions in the past few years, including Plex, Fiix and ASEM. Lifecycle Services margin was similar to last year and improving sequentially through the year as planned. Our focus on productivity is yielding benefits now and into the coming quarters. We continue to expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4. The next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal '22 to Q3 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $0.90 excluding increased investment spend of $0.35 on a 13.2% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher expected bonus payout this year versus a below normal payout last year. The year-over-year impacts from tax, interest expense, currency and share count were each immaterial to EPS this quarter. Before we turn to our fiscal '23 guidance, let's spend a few minutes talking about our orders trends on Slide 11. We think it will be helpful to provide more color on our orders progression over the last couple of years and going forward. First, in fiscal 2020, we saw reduced orders caused by the constraints on customers' operations and uncertainty that the pandemic created. Then, in fiscal '21 and fiscal '22, we saw increased orders driven by the combination of three things: first, historically high levels of investment in certain verticals like EV and semi as well as an increasing need for more automation to address workforce shortages and business resiliency. Second, catch up on projects that many of our customers deferred during fiscal year '20. And three, large advanced orders due to extended lead times caused by component shortages. In fiscal year '23, we are continuing to see strong underlying demand but we are now seeing the long-anticipated moderation in orders driven by our improving lead times for products. As we stated earlier, we expect lead times to continue to normalize in the next 2 quarters and we expect virtually all of our product lead times to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year '23. Once our lead times are back at normal levels, we expect customer orders to closely align with the strong underlying demand. I think it's worth noting that over the fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year '23 time period, encompassing the ups and downs of the order cycle, we will have grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% plus a backlog that has more than tripled during that time frame. Let's now move to the next Slide 12, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing the midpoint of our reported sales guidance from 14.5% to 15%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 14% to 16%, and we now expect a full year currency headwind of 100 basis points, 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. We continue to expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. And we still expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, unchanged from prior guidance. Our updated guidance still assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, unchanged from our prior guide. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.70 to $12.10. This increases the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $11.90, up $0.05 from prior guidance and up 25% from last year. The $0.05 increase is driven by currency. We now expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. This updated guidance reflects the new calendarization of our revenue and our updated projection of inventory days on hand. We do expect our inventory days on hand to drop by the end of the year to 125 days. This will be lower than the approximately 130 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '22, but will likely not reduce to the 112 days we originally expected. Our outlook for cash tax payments also increased as we realized capital gains on our sales of PTC shares. Income tax payments tied to these gains are reflected in our free cash flow results.A few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be about $130 million. And we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&amp;A. Blake?Blake D. MoretThanks, Nick. As we continue to stay close to end users, machine builders and distributors, a few key themes emerge. First, demand remains strong. We've mentioned softness in e-commerce and in parts of the Chinese economy, but investment by end users and machinery builders continues across the majority of regions and serve verticals. Second, the global supply chain is improving, but it will take some months to flush the inefficiencies that have built up over the last few years, especially inventory. This is seen at machine builders, distributors and in our own operations. Third, the opportunities for automation to play a strategic role in our customers' success have never been higher. Workforce scarcity, American shoring of manufacturing and the premium being placed on business agility are all positive reads for Rockwell. We're moving fast to meet these needs with new capacity and capabilities. It's hard to believe, but our annual Automation Fair and Investor Day are only about 3 months away. And you should look forward to hearing more about the exciting next leg of our journey. I want to thank all our employees and also our unmatched distributors, who have worked so hard to bring us to this point and who collectively make the difference at our customers. Aijana will now begin the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionAijana Zellner(Operator Instructions) Julianne, let's take our first question.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.Andrew Alec KaplowitzBlake or Nick, can you give us more color into the order of visibility you have that allowed you to construct Slide 11? About the timing, it looks like you expect a relatively significant orders inflection higher, maybe even in the first half of '24. And it also looks like you think orders could reach the peak levels again that you saw in '22. Is that what you're attempting to say? And then what markets would you most likely see an uptick in bookings?Blake D. MoretYes, Andy, there's a few factors that contribute to that outlook for orders. So first are the continued high investment levels and some important verticals for us. We see continued investments as we track new CapEx announcements in areas like semiconductor, in EV and renewables, while we see a general focus on automation at many of our other verticals like food and beverage, life sciences, energy, and so on. We also have had a number of conversations with customers and distributors that give us a consistent view that demand remains strong. As I and members of my team have talked directly to machine builders and end users, they're all proceeding with plans based on the consistent demand for their products.We described in my remarks what we're seeing in terms of machine builders who are not placing the unusually large advance orders that they did, say, a year ago. And we've also had direct conversations with our distributors. And in North America, some of our largest distributors are actually seeing year-over-year order increases. So again, that consistently strong demand picture informs that view that we showed you on Slide 11 of orders recovering, complementing the remaining strong backlog.Andrew Alec KaplowitzAnd then Nick, can you quantify how much impact the change in U.S. distribution you made had on sales and earnings in Q3? And then specifically, could you go over how to think about margin moving forward for your segments? It looks like -- you talked about the change impacting Intelligent Devices. But moving forward, should we be thinking 20%, 21% for that segment, which was your prior guide? And then conversely, software margin continues to go up, can you sustain mid-30% margins in that segment?Nicholas C. GangestadYes, as far as the sales impact, we had originally planned when we guided what we expected for growth expectations between Q3 and Q4, we had expected some disruption. We were planning close to a week of disruption that this would be causing and the loss of capacity during our third quarter. That ended up extending by several more days in terms of the total impact it had on us. All in, something in the range of $50 million to $100 million of revenue is, I think, a good ballpark to think about of what we're seeing of a shift of revenue there between the third and fourth quarter from what we were anticipating 3 months ago. And then in terms of margin progression, Andy, for the rest of this year, we continue to expect that margins will expand. We think fourth quarter margins will be our highest margin for the year. We continue to expect to see strong margins in our Software &amp; Control business, something similar to what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. And as I've said, for the last couple of quarters, we expect sequential margin improvement in Lifecycle Services. We expect that will be over 10% in Q4. And then Intelligent Devices, as we recapture some of that revenue that shifted from Q3 to Q4, we think added revenue there will be bringing that margin up from where we were in the third quarter. All in, we still expect ITD's -- Intelligent Devices margin to be a little under 20% for the full year. Software &amp; Control to be well over 30%, and Lifecycle Services will be below 10% for the full year, and it will be similar to a little less than what it was in fiscal '22, but all in progressing nicely with the focus we're having on productivity there.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiBlake, just on the order normalization and customers, including some of the OEMs adapting to shorter lead times. I sort of get that that's kind of maybe a bit of a one-time accordion squeeze as those folks don't need to go out the same length of time or even pull that in. Any sense of sizing what that is, what that impact might be on that implied second half order outlook? Just trying to distinguish between the supply chain and sort of the back end of that phenomenon versus maybe what run rate orders might be.Blake D. MoretYes. I mean giving a little bit more color on how this plays out. During the most constrained period of component shortages, we saw some OEMs that were placing orders for a year or more of their equipment demand, where in normal times, when lead times were at, let's say, normal for the products that they put in their equipment, that might be only 3 or 4 months of demand. Now that's not across the board, but we did see cases of those larger orders. As the lead times have recovered actually a little bit faster than we expected over the last quarter or so and as we expect them to continue to improve, then we see OEMs no longer needing to place such long orders. And as they focus, as I said, on flushing some of the inventory and WIP that they have in their operations, importantly, their frontlog remains strong. And as I visited machine builders and my staff has visited machine builders over the last couple of months, that's a consistent message that their demand remains strong. It's just they don't need to place such a large block of orders. Now I want to put this in perspective. OEMs are in the neighborhood of 1/3 of our business. So we don't see the same patterns or need for those large orders at users, but that is an effect that's impacted our machine builders. And in a little bit of a similar time frame with our distributors, their inventories will relieve as they get those last constrained items over the next couple of months and are able to ship their committed inventory. That's inventory that's already been committed to specific end-user projects.Joshua Charles PokrzywinskiGot it. That's helpful. And then maybe for a follow-up, just want to take a step back. I mean there are a lot of elements of the business now where you can sort of see this before and after in terms of investment. We talked a lot about nearshoring, energy transition, you see process orders looking strong on that. But I can't help but notice that 30% of the business is food and bev and consumer packaged goods, where I don't know if it's quite as obvious that we're seeing near-shoring or some fundamental breakout. I know you called out a bigger food and bev win, but maybe just talk about how that piece of the business has seen a secular shift or perhaps have -- if you want to put backlog in context or anything else there that would be helpful.Blake D. MoretSure. So you're right. I mean that, as part of our hybrid industry segment, is the single largest segment of our end-market demand, and what we're seeing in food and beverage and home and personal care is an increased focus on efficiency and resilience. So even though we don't see the same amount of greenfield investment that we do, say, with electric vehicles or batteries, those big food and beverage companies are investing in their resilience. So they're adding some measure of redundancy. They're investing heavily in OT cybersecurity, which is one of our very fastest-growing businesses and meaningful multimillion-dollar orders. They're also dealing with workforce shortages. So we're all aware that unemployment remains very low. And I think in general, that's a positive read for us, but it creates continuing problems with these manufacturers in staffing those lines. And so they're looking for augmenting the technology that we're providing with highly trained workers as those workers are more scarce. And we're seeing our offering result in some important competitive wins. We've added more ways to win. So it's not just our core technology, it's our cybersecurity services, and we talked about several wins with Plex as the synergy wins ramp up there as we turn on that market access machine. So those are some of the things that are driving the good food and beverage and home and personal care growth that we're seeing this year.OperatorOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellMaybe not taking a step back. If we look at Slide 11, you've got the order trends line chart there. Trying to think about backlog-to-sales coverage and where you think that normalizes. As you said, pre-COVID you were 20% odd backlog to sales. Recently, you've been well over 50%, but that will come down. And I just wondered your sort of best views on where it settles out. Because I guess, if we look at some of your peers like FANUC, they've all seen this huge orders slump as well, and they're talking about customer inventory depletion through next year. And I guess one could also make the case perhaps that more localized supply chains can mean shorter lead times and order patterns, not longer ones. So just wondered sort of your perspectives on that and testing that conviction around why the orders improve from early calendar '24.Blake D. MoretSure. I'll make a few comments, Julian, and then Nick may have some additional detail. As you think about the composition of our business, for a starting point, we said the backlog that we expect to finish the fiscal year in a couple of months with is remaining high between $4.5 billion and $5 billion, and 80% of that is shippable in fiscal year '24. I think your question is, okay, how does that develop? And what is beyond that? Think about the product backlog as lead times return to normal for products at the end of this calendar year is getting back to its normal low levels of backlog. We traditionally looked at products as having lead times of days or weeks that either ships directly off our distributor shelves or we build it very quickly in our factories. And I think that gets back in fiscal year '24. There's a portion of that product business within Intelligent Devices that is configured to order. And that continues to have lead times that are measured typically in weeks, sometimes in a couple of months. That business has been really strong for us here recently. We think we're gaining considerable share there. And so that's going to be a somewhat meaningful component of backlog even after '24 within the Intelligent Devices area. And then as Lifecycle Services becomes bigger, continues to grow, then we typically have seen somewhere in the neighborhood of half a year of backlog for Lifecycle Services. So backlog becomes smaller as we leave fiscal year '24, but it remains considerably larger than the $1.5 billion or so that you remember from pre-pandemic. Because we're a bigger company and we have some of these new components, I would also say there's software and recurring revenue that continues to grow nicely. We talked about ARR growing 17% this quarter. And so that's a part of the equation as well. Nick?Nicholas C. GangestadYes. And Julian, to frame it up a little in the way you asked the question where pre-pandemic backlog closer to 20% of our revenue and more recently this year where we're around 50% or higher than 50%. I don't -- based on the things Blake was just describing, I don't think it will go back down to 20%. But something in the 30% or low 30s percent. I think that's a reasonable estimation right now for us, Julian, of where to think where our backlog is in a more normal state.Julian C.H. MitchellThat's very helpful. And I appreciate it's very difficult to call. Maybe on the areas or markets where you're seeing or expecting the most severe orders normalization, do we assume it's mostly discrete markets globally? I think China, there's obviously some orders pressure that your peers have talked about, but is it sort of a global phenomenon across various discrete markets? Is that the way to think about it?Blake D. MoretYes. I think it's the phenomenon that we described with machine builders, which is not exclusively in discrete. We have a good business with skilled OEMs, process machine builders as well, but they're buying product. It's less weighted towards engineered solutions. So I think that's where you've seen that phenomenon as they were placing orders for a year or sometimes more of their machine coverage, and they don't need to do that anymore. And so they're looking at opportunities to improve their cash flow, get the existing equipment out as the constrained products from us deliver and then to fill their forward machine needs with smaller orders because they can depend more on the lead times.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.Jeffrey Todd SpragueSorry if I missed it. I was on a few minutes late, but a lot of talk about future backlog. But could you just square us up on where the backlog actually ended in the quarter, and also kind of what the price volume complexion was in the actual quarter?Nicholas C. GangestadJeff, I'll take the second part of your question first. Of our 13% organic growth, 10% of that was volume and 3% of that was price. And it was very much like as we expected. This was the quarter where we are starting to lap ourselves against the more significant price increases that we were realizing in the second half of our fiscal year '22. In terms of the backlog, we haven't put out a specific number on it, Jeff. It did come down some in Q3, and we expect it to come down further in Q4 to that $4.5 billion to $5 billion range. But we haven't put a specific number on that, partly weaning ourselves off of like frequent updates on all of that, but giving you a trend of where that's going.Jeffrey Todd SpragueOkay. Great. Yes, it's just helpful to have the anchor if we're going to talk about the future, right? So we can all relate to that in future conversations, but I get it. And then just on investment spending, is there actually a change in the year outlook on how you'll -- the level of investment spending or just a timing between quarters?Nicholas C. GangestadJeff, investment spend is staying almost exactly where we've been expecting, both for the year and by quarter actually. It's very, very much following our plan.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.Andrew Burris ObinJust as you think about -- it seems that you are about to embark on a multiyear growth spurt. How should we think -- how do you guys think about your cash conversion structurally going forward? Do you just need to accept permanently lower cash conversion and we just need to invest in working capital and growth? And if not, what levers can you pull to sort of get it back to this 95% level that we've had?Nicholas C. GangestadYes, Andrew, thanks for that question. The -- our longer-term plan and expectation is that we should be at 100% free cash flow conversion or averaging that over time, even in a period where we are growing more substantially than we have, I'll say, pre-pandemic. And with where we stand now with our working capital, where we're estimating it to exit fiscal year '23, we think that creates some tailwinds for us in cash conversion in the next couple of years for us that even in a higher growth world, we can still be generating something, from an operational standpoint, closer to the 100% free cash flow conversion. There are a couple of headwinds. I'll just want to make sure you're aware of, Andrew. One is we are at the point now where we are making more substantial cash tax payments on the transition tax that was part of TCJA. Some companies adjust that out of their free cash flow conversion. We don't. We keep that in there. And we're also being impacted by the recent requirement that we capitalize, for tax purposes, our R&amp;D expense. And that's having a several percentage point, between 5 and 10 percentage points impact to our free cash flow conversion in the next 2 years. It's something after 5 or 6 years, we work our way through that just becomes part of the base, but it is having that between 5% and 10% impact to free cash flow conversion. And then the last I'll note is, as we've been liquidating our PTC shares, realizing the gain, the nuances of how free cash flow reporting is, that gain is not part of our denominator in that equation, but the cash taxes is part of the numerator in that equation. And it's just a nuance in pointing out that it has impacted us this year and could impact us in coming quarters as well. But I'll call those more noise versus your underlying question, I think, on our -- the ability of our business model to be generating 100% free cash flow conversion.Andrew Burris ObinGreat. And then just on your ARR, I think, 17% very healthy. Could you give us a look sort of under the hood what the components are? Which portions of your business is doing better? Maybe talk about MES, talk about Fiix, Plex. Whatever it is you guys you want to talk about, but just give us a sense of what's driving the software growth.Blake D. MoretSure. So I mentioned a few wins with Plex in the quarter. And Plex has continued to be a good performer for us, both in terms of the expansion of existing customers as well as new logos where Rockwell's market access gave us opportunities there. So Plex was a strong performer in the quarter, Fiix as well with the asset management. These are two SaaS applications that are doing quite well for us and contributed substantially to that 17% ARR. I mentioned some wins with PTC. Those are subscription wins, and those were some major competitive victories for us in the quarter. And then on the high-value services side, cybersecurity services. And I've talked about that, that's been right at the top of our fast-growing businesses, and we have a recurring revenue component of cyber. So those things were probably at the top of the list and contributing to what, you're right, was really good ARR in the quarter.OperatorOur next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.Charles Stephen TusaCan we just talk -- can you just remind us. I mean you guys were relatively -- we never really had this orders discussion before COVID. Like your book-to-bill was generally like around 1 back then, right? Is that about right?Nicholas C. GangestadYes, Steve, that is correct. The only exception is our Lifecycle Services business component, that could have some nuances from quarter to quarter. But generally, we were pretty much a 1:1 book-to-bill.Charles Stephen TusaRight. So like eating in the backlog this quarter you mentioned. So obviously, your orders were like -- what were they like, a little bit above 2 or something like that? .Blake D. MoretYes. We haven't given the specific order value for Q3, but we gave the full year expectation of $8.5 billion to $9 billion of orders.Charles Stephen TusaOkay. And when we look at this kind of like daily order volume, I mean like that would kind of equate to the quarterly order numbers, I would think. That's not like scaled or adjusted for seasonality or anything like that, right?Nicholas C. GangestadThat is correct. We're not adjusting for any seasonality here.Charles Stephen TusaYes. Okay. That's fair. And then just the last question, just philosophically, you guys went from like not really giving orders to maybe even not disclosing them this year. At one point, I think you guys were thinking about that. Now you're disclosing them and now you're kind of like forecasting them, I guess. Are we going to continue to get this level of color as we go through the next couple of quarters? Like -- maybe like just philosophically, any view on like maybe normalizing some of this disclosure because it just seems like there's more provided but it's in different forms and it just seems like it's not particularly as straightforward as maybe it could be.Blake D. MoretSo Steve, we're continuing to provide the information that we think is most important to investors. And over the last few years, as you said, orders have become a more important component as they have decoupled from shipments at different times. And so we felt it was important to provide that additional information. As we look at going forward, we're going to continue to look at where orders remain material to investor decisions and to provide that kind of information. And we continue to look at how we're making decisions about running the business going forward and providing you some insight into that. And that's why it's going to take some different forms as time goes on because the value of it and the horizon of that, I think, are important. So this quarter, we made the decision to give a little bit of a view going forward and showing on that Slide 11, the relationship between orders and big macro events going forward so that you and investors can put that into perspective.Charles Stephen TusaYes. And it is helpful. So thank you for all the extra disclosure here regardless. So thanks Aijana for that. Really appreciate it.OperatorOur next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.Noah Duke KayeI just want to go to Lifecycle Services. Several quarters continuing a positive book-to-bill. You commented on margins for this year. How do we think about incremental margins going forward, especially as you start to get this sort of richer mix, right? I know a lot of revenue associated with what comes out of, ends up in S&amp;C, but just help us think about incremental margins going forward.Nicholas C. GangestadYes. As I think about where we're going with margins in our Lifecycle Services business in the next couple of years, I -- we expect that Lifecycle Services will be an outsized contributor to our margin expansion in the coming years. So one way we think about our margin expansion is through our core conversion of the 30% to 35% range. That would imply that Lifecycle Services is going to be helpful to that to that number. So as I look over the next couple of years, I believe Lifecycle Services will be our highest margin expansion business segment of the 3 segments.Blake D. MoretYes. And I would say that the Sensia contribution, which is in Lifecycle, we have seen improvement there, and we expect to see continued improvement. So that's a major component.Noah Duke KayeAnd maybe just want to step back and ask a broader question about the demand environment. In past quarters, you and the industry and trade press and all sorts of folks have talked about the long runway here from IRA, IIJA, shoring, all these trends. When you look at a quarter like this and see some of the order dynamics, and I understand a lot of that is just supply chain normalizing, I guess, when we step back, where do you think we kind of are in this wave of manufacturing investment and specifically in the United States?Blake D. MoretYes. I think I like looking at a vertical-by-vertical approach of this because it breaks it down into, I'd say, more objective components. EV and battery, by any objective measure, there is continued strong investment as people are building out the capacity to build more electric vehicles. If you look at any city in the U.S., the number of electric vehicles remains low, all projections of that's going to increase, and there's nowhere near as much capacity needed to serve that demand even with the announcements of new greenfields that have already been made. So we see that as a multiyear trend. Semiconductor, for national security reasons and to be able to reduce geopolitical risk impacting the semiconductors that make our world go, we see that as a multiyear trend. And importantly, it's not just the fabs, it's all the supporting infrastructure that's needed to make that stick as well. We talk about redundancy and resiliency in some of the other industries, food and beverage, life sciences with offerings, not just the core automation but the additional software and the services, I think these are multiyear trends. Workforce, again, with unemployment as low as it is, it's just not possible to build the things that we need to preserve a standard of living without the technology augmenting a highly engaged workforce. Those 2 things are going to be required across a broad swath of the industries that we serve. So I think the outlook for automation remains good over a multiyear period. We're seeing the current impact of some of the ordering dynamics that we've talked a lot about on this call but the fundamental outlook for automation and Rockwell's ability to outperform, I think is very strong.Aijana ZellnerJulianne, we will take one more question.OperatorOur last question will come from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.Nigel Edward CoeSo we cut a lot of ground here, but just North America was 1% organic. So even if we factor in the $50 million to $100 million impact from the DC, it still seemed quite weak. I'm sure there's some inventory headwinds there. But are we seeing any pushout in some of the larger projects in North America?Blake D. MoretThe main contributor to the growth in North America is really the composition of the backlog. And in fact, as we look at the orders in North America, they've outpaced the rest of the world year-to-date in fiscal year '23. There are certainly anecdotes of projects that have been pushed, but we have not seen that as a prevalent trend, and we continue to see low cancellation rates within our backlog.Nigel Edward CoeOkay. That's very clear. And then, Nick, your comments on sort of what the normal backlog is and obviously higher than what it's been in the past, but it seems to suggest that we should be expecting backlog to maybe burn down towards maybe close to $3 billion. Is that fair?Nicholas C. GangestadYes. It's dependent on what revenue is. But for those reasons that Blake went through in our mix, we just don't see it getting back to that 20% that it used to be, but something in the 30% to 35% range, and yes, multiply that by our revenue, and that's our best estimate now. I think in the coming quarters, we'll keep learning more about that, but we ask for our best estimate right now, that's where we are.Aijana ZellnerThank you, everyone, for joining us today. That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you.]"

Norwegian stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as the cruise company continues to regain its footing following the pandemic.To that point, Norwegian's second-quarter earnings of $0.30 a share topped estimates by 11% and soared from an adjusted loss of -$1.14 a share in the prior-year quarter. On the top line, sales of $2.20 billion surpassed expectations by 1% and soared 86% from a year ago.Still, Norwegian stock fell -12% today primarily attributed to the company’s EPS guidance being below many analysts’ estimates for the third quarter. Norwegian expects Q3 EPS at $0.70 which is also below the Zacks Consensus of $0.80 a share. With that being said, today’s selloff may have already served as a healthy correction.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRockwell Automation (ROK): Falling -7% today Rockwell Automation’s stock could be a buy-the-dip candidate after slightly missing its fiscal third-quarter top and bottom line expectations this morning.Providing industrial automation and information services, Rockwell stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Retaining this favorable ranking will largely depend on the trend in earnings estimate revisions following the report as the selloff may present opportunity for longer-term investors.Rockwell’s Q3 earnings missed expectations by -5% at $3.01 per share compared to EPS estimates of $3.19. However, this was still up 13% from Q3 earnings of $2.66 per share a year ago. Quarterly sales were up 14% YoY to $2.23 billion but fell -2% short of expectations.Story continuesDespite the weaker-than-expected results, Rockwell’s quarterly growth was still strong and the company raised the midpoint of its fiscal 2023 earnings and sales growth guidance. Rockwell now expects FY23 sales growth at a range of 14-16% from previous guidance of 12.5-16.5% with the Zacks Consensus calling for about 15% sales growth. Annual EPS guidance from Rockwell is now at a range between $11.70-12.10 compared to previous guidance of $11.50-12.20 with the Zacks Consensus for FY23 earnings at $12.02 a share which would be up 26% from 2022.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUber Technologies (UBER): There were many eyes on Uber’s stock today which dipped -5% after reporting its Q2 results this morning.Uber also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the pullback appears to be some profit-taking mixed with concerns of lower demand among the company’s freight segment. Sales for Uber’s Freight and Transportation services fell -30% YoY to $1.28 billion and the segment posted an operating loss of -$14 million compared to a profit of $5 million a year ago.Uber still crushed earnings expectations with EPS at $0.18 compared to estimates that called for an adjusted loss of -$0.01 a share. This also soared from an adjusted loss of -$1.33 a share in Q2 2022. Sales of $9.23 billion rose 14% YoY but missed estimates by -1%.Analysts still appeared to be optimistic about Uber’s stock despite lowering lofty price targets on Uber freight concerns. To that point, the current Average Zacks Price Target of $53.84 a share still suggests 14% upside from current levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFor now, Norwegian Curse Line, Rockwell Automation, and Uber Technologies stock still look attractive at their current levels and today’s selloff may have presented even better buying opportunities. The long-term prospects of these companies is intriguing and they are certainly buy the dip canidates. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Spirit warned that growing labor costs, continued supply chain disruptions, and its rising debt burden were adding to financial difficulties as it struggles to meet the glut of orders from aircraft giants Boeing and Airbus.""There is a sense of urgency by the management team here,"" Chief Financial Officer Chief Financial Officer Mark Suchinski said.Shares ended down 27.3% to $22.86, the lowest close since November 2022.Analysts focused specifically on whether the mounting financial difficulties would cause Spirit to try to re-negotiate contracts with Boeing and Airbus - its biggest customers - to account for inflation and other rising costs.Spirit now projects that annual free cash burn - or the company's expected cash consumption - will be in the $200 million to $250 million range, compared with the $100 million to $150 million annual cash burn expected in the first quarter.The company said a two-week work stoppage by employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) in Wichita, Kansas - as well as the ensuing labor agreement - piled even more financial pressure, adding $80 million in annual labor costs and contributing to losses on Boeing programs.""The orders are coming in, production rates are going up, but all suppliers are facing challenges with these higher level of costs,"" CEO Tom Gentile said, responding to questions on contract renegotiation.He added that rising material and labor costs were an ""important systemic issue"" that Airbus and Boeing ""do need to address,"" but did not specifically say whether the company had engaged the planemakers.Story continuesSpirit also said it absorbed $28.3 million in costs related to the new labor deal, as well as $7.3 million in strike disruption charges in the second-quarter.While Suchinski said free cash flow is expected to turn positive in the 2024-2025 timeframe, Gentile added that the company will have to look at refinancing options to pay down debt due in April 2025. The company has $3.1 billion in outstanding bonds, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, with nearly 40% of that set to mature in 2025.""Spirit’s finances remain in a parlous state,"" wrote Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard in a note. ""Being in virtual indentured servitude to Boeing is not a good place to be, and we struggle to see a pathway to consistent free cashflow generation.""'DISTRESSED SUPPLIERS' AND PROGRAM LOSSESSpirit reported a quarterly adjusted loss per share of $1.39, bigger than analyst expectations of an 87 cents per share loss, per Refinitiv data.While revenue rose 8% to $1.37 billion, cash burn was $211 million for the three months through June, the company said, compared to $79 million a year earlier.The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Airbus A350 and the Airbus A220 programs each took a multimillion dollar hit due to labor, supply chain costs and production recovery rate efforts.Due to the pause in production during the strike, Spirit will deliver 370 to 390 narrowbody 737 fuselages to Boeing in 2023, down from the 390 to 420 fuselages expected last quarter.While Spirit is ramping 737 fuselage production to 42 per month in August, ""we won't be able to fully recover the lost manufacturing days from the work stoppage,"" in part because days off will keep Spirit delivering at a pace of about 35 fuselages per month in the back half, Gentile said.Over the past 18 months, Spirit has had to absorb $200 million in costs due to supply chain challenges, Gentile said.""We still see examples of distressed suppliers, even smaller ones, which have significantly disrupted our operations because of shortages we've had to address,"" he said.Spirit executives said the company is taking on more inventory in the back half of the year as a hedge against supply chain issues to accommodate the 737 ramp up, with at least one additional rate increase expected in 2024.In one bright spot for the company, Spirit announced it has completed all work needed to fix incorrectly installed fittings on 737 aircraft at its factory, resolving a major problem discovered this spring at the $31 million cost it initially expected.However, it said it recorded a $23 million loss in revenue ""to account for a potential claim from Boeing for repair work to date at their facility,"" adding that this estimate represents ""the low end of the range of potential liability.""

In the second quarter, the company absorbed $28.3 million in costs related to the new labor deal as well as $7.3 million in strike disruption charges.While Spirit is ramping 737 fuselage production to 42 per month in August, ""we won't be able to fully recover the lost manufacturing days from the work stoppage,"" in part because days off will keep Spirit delivering at a pace of about 35 fuselages per month in the back half, CEO Tom Gentile said during an earnings callAnnual free cash burn is now expected to be in the $200 million to $250 million range, compared with the $100 million to $150 million annual cash burn expected in the first quarter, executives said.Shares of Spirit extended losses to trade down about 14% after executive comments on Wednesday.Net forward loss charges for Spirit ballooned by about 64% compared to the same period last year.Aside from the strike disruption charges, the company took a $37.5 million hit on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner program due to the new IAM contract and increased supply chain costs, a $27.5 million charge on the Airbus A350 due to production rate recovery efforts and a $27.4 million charge on the Airbus A220 program due to higher supply chain costs.Story continuesThe company also reported $21.6 million in unfavorable catch up adjustments related to the 737, reflecting higher labor and supply chain costs.Over the past 18 months, Spirit has had to absorb $200 million in costs due to supply chain challenges, Gentile said.""We still see examples of distressed suppliers, even smaller ones, which have significantly disrupted our operations because of shortages we've had to address,"" he said.Spirit executives said the company is taking on more inventory in the back half of the year as a hedge against supply chain issues to accommodate the 737 ramp up, with at least one additional rate increase expected in 2024.Spirit reported a quarterly adjusted loss per share of $1.39, bigger than analyst expectations of an 87 cents per share loss, per Refinitiv data.While revenue rose 8% to $1.37 billion, cash burn was $211 million for the three months through June, the company said, compared to $79 million a year earlier.""While these numbers from Spirit are pretty grim reading, we suspect that investors had been braced for something in this ball park,"" said Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard.J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said the main positive takeaway is that cash flow for the second quarter was not lower than expected.Spirit on Wednesday said it had completed all work needed to fix incorrectly installed fittings that join the aft fuselage to the vertical tail on 737 aircraft at its factory, resolving a major problem discovered this spring at the $31 million cost it initially expected, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Suchinski.However, it said it recorded a $23 million loss in revenue ""to account for a potential claim from Boeing for repair work to date at their facility,"" adding that this estimate represents ""the low end of the range of potential liability."" Suchinski said the charge represents about half of the affected 737s in Boeing's inventory.(Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram and Valerie Insinna; Editing by Will Dunham, Mark Porter, Kirsten Donovan)]"

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.Story continuesJohn C. PlantThanks, PT, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenues were up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Albeit, Q2 is traditionally a stronger quarter seasonally than Q1 due to more effective production and sales days. Commercial aerospace increased by 23% year-over-year and continues to be the highlight of the quarter and reflects some of the scheduled increases for the anticipated Boeing 737 build rates, which are slated to increase very soon.Defense sales were also strong at plus 17%. EBITDA was up 16% year-over-year and up sequentially. Earnings per share increased to $0.44 per share and exceeded the high end of guidance. This was an increase of 26% year-over-year. The cash balance was a healthy $536 million, and free cash flow was strong at $188 million, which started at consecutive quarters of cash generation. $100 million of cash flow was used to buy back shares at an average price of $45 per share. Net debt to EBITDA further improved to 2.5x leverage and all bond debt is at a fixed rate, which provide predictable interest rate expenses into the future, Howmet has negligible exposure to floating interest rates. Regarding our Revolver, we amended and extended our $1 billion undrawn credit facility to 2028, while realizing lower fees and a more favorable net debt-to-EBITDA covenant.Lastly, another notable item was the commercial settlement of Lehman claim, $40 million, which is 25 million less than previously reserved, with a cash settlement we paid in July 2023 and a further settlement in July 2024. This litigation was the most significant of all residual claims for Howmet, namely RemainCo, and dates back to 2008. Before turning it over to Ken, I want to cover 3 additional items. Firstly, in Q2, Howmet was impacted by approximately 5 days of production stoppage at our Wheels plant in Hungary due to a 9-day strike at Arconic Corporation, which is now resolved.The interruption of suppliers of aluminum billet had an unfavorable effect of about $5 million to profitability for which a claim has been lodged with Arconic under the terms of the supply agreement, and we expect to gain resolution shortly.Additionally, Howmet is assessing its significant reliance upon this source of supply.Secondly, while segment commentaries including the finance portion of our call, let me address structures. The margin rate fell back for the first time in several quarters. The profit miss was essentially the result of adding costs or production rate increases, which we did not achieve. The cost of additional people, furnace preparation and other rolling mill facilities preparation were unrecovered due to the production rate increases not being achieved.The main issue was bottlenecks in production at one plant. The backlog did increase since it was not a demand issue. Naturally, our plan is to achieve production rate increases and burn down the increased backlog as we move into the second half. This reduced production combined with F-35 bulk and inventory burn down was also not helpful. But it was, in aggregate, not material in the context of the Howmet overall results, which were again up, as I commented earlier.Finally, the Paris Airshow was held in June with the largest significant orders ever at an airshow for commercial aircraft, which adds to the backlog of orders fulfilled -- to be fulfilled once production rates are able to be further increased. The show was very successful for Howmet with a combination of production meetings with both customers and investors all reflecting the huge optimism for both the industry generally and for Howmet, in particular.I'll now turn the call over to Ken, who will provide further market and segment commentary.Kenneth J. GiacobbeThank you, John. Let's move to Slide 5. All markets continue to be healthy with revenue in the quarter up 18% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Commercial aerospace continued to lead the growth with an increase of 23% year-over-year, driven by all 3 aerospace segments. Commercial aerospace has grown for 9 consecutive quarters and stands at 47% of total revenue. Commercial aerospace portion of total revenue is expected to increase due to the developing widebody recovery, strong backlog of commercial aircraft orders and spares growth.Spares for commercial aerospace continued to increase sequentially and are now trending to be approximately 95% of 2019 levels at year-end. Defense aerospace was up 17% year-over-year, driven by the F-35 in legacy fighter programs. Sequentially, defense aerospace was up 4% year-over-year, driven by engine products.Commercial transportation, which impacts both the Forged Wheels and Fastening Systems segments, was up 8% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially driven by higher volumes. Finally, the industrial and other markets were up 20% year-over-year, driven by oil and gas, up 36%; IGT, up 20%; and general industrial, up 11%.Sequentially, these markets were up 4% with general industrial up 9%; oil and gas up 4%; and IGT flat. In summary, another very strong quarter across all of our end markets. Now let's move to Slide 6. Starting with the P&amp;L and enhanced profitability, revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share, all exceeded the high end of the guidance in the second quarter.Revenue was $1.65 billion, up 18% year-over-year. EBITDA was $368 million, up 16% year-over-year, including net head count additions in Q2 of approximately 380 employees, which builds on additions made in Q1. Year-to-date, net head count additions are approximately 865, which are in line with our targets. EBITDA margin was 22.3%. Adjusting for the year-over-year inflationary cost pass-through of approximately $25 million EBITDA margin was 22.7% and the flow-through of incremental revenue to EBITDA was approximately 22% while absorbing near-term recruiting, training and production costs.Earnings per share was $0.44, which was up 26% year-over-year. The second quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of growth in revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share. Moving to the balance sheet. The ending cash balance was healthy at $536 million after generating $188 million of free cash flow which was our best Q2 of free cash flow generation. We continue to expect strong positive free cash flow in the second half of 2023.$118 million of free cash flow generation was allocated to common stock repurchases and dividends. Net debt to EBITDA improved to a record low of 2.5x, while bond debt is unsecured and at fixed rates, which will provide stability of interest rate expense into the future. Our next bond maturity is in October of 2024.Finally, we amended our $1 billion revolver through 2028, while realizing lower fees and a more favorable financial covenant. The revolver remains undrawn. Moving to capital allocation. We continue to be balanced in our approach. In the quarter, capital expenditures were $41 million with a focus on automation. Capital installed prior to COVID-19 puts us in a good position to support continued commercial aerospace recovery.In the second quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock at an average price of $44.52 per share, retiring approximately 2.2 million shares. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of common stock repurchases. -- Share buyback authority from the Board of Directors stands at approximately $822 million. Since separation in 2020, we have repurchased more than $1 billion of common stock. We continue to be confident in free cash flow. In the second quarter, the quarterly stock dividend was $0.04 per share after it was doubled in the fourth quarter of last year. Finally, we issued a note to redeem $200 million of our 2024 debt tower with cash on hand. The redemption is expected to be complete at the end of September and will lower our annualized interest cost by approximately $10 million. As you will recall, we repurchased approximately $176 million of bonds last quarter, which will lower annualized interest costs by an additional $9 million.Therefore, year-to-date, bond repurchases are expected to decrease annualized interest costs by approximately $19 million.Now let's move to Slide 7 to cover the segment results for the second quarter. Engine Products continued its strong performance since the second quarter represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in revenue and EBITDA. The Revenue was $821 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. Commercial aerospace was up 23%, Defense/aerospace was up 41%, and both markets were driven by higher build rates and spares growth.IGT was up 20%, and oil and gas was up 36% as demand continues to be strong. EBITDA increased 25% year-over-year to a record for the segment of $223 million. EBITDA margin was 27.2%, despite the addition of approximately 350 net new employees year-to-date and approximately 90 net additions in Q2. Across all of the aerospace segments, net head count additions are needed for the continued revenue ramp, but do carry near-term recruiting, training and production costs.Finally, in the second quarter, the Engine's team finalized a new 5-year collective bargaining agreement in our Whitehall Michigan facility.Let's move to Slide 8. Fastening Systems year-over-year revenue increased 19%. Commercial aerospace was 19% higher as the widebody recovery starts to take effect. Defense aerospace was up 24%, commercial aerospace was up 17% and general industrial was up 16%. Year-over-year segment EBITDA increased 14% as volume increases were partially offset by the addition of 430 net new employees year-to-date and approximately 215 net additions in Q2.Now let's move to Slide 9. In Engineered Structures year-over-year revenue was up 8% with commercial aerospace up 31%, driven by higher build rates in approximately $25 million of Russian titanium share gain. Defense aerospace was down 33% year-over-year, driven by customer inventory corrections. Segment EBITDA decreased 23% year-over-year, while margins declined 410 basis points. The lower EBITDA was driven by higher costs associated with additional head count as well as operational costs for planned production rate increases, which were unrecovered due to production bottlenecks in 1 plant.Net head count additions in the quarter were approximately 50 employees. Finally, in the third quarter, the Structures' team finalized a new 4-year collective bargaining agreement at our Niles, Ohio facility, which was ahead of schedule.Now let's move to Slide 10. Forged Wheels revenue year-over-year increased 7%. The $19 million increase in revenue year-over-year was driven by a 6% increase in volume. Segment EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year, despite the interruption of raw material for our Wheels plant in Hungary due to a 9-day strike at our Arconic Corporation supplier, which has now been resolved.Margin increased 30 basis points due to the impact of lower aluminum prices and inflationary cost pass-through.Finally, let's move to Slide 11. We continue to be focused on improving our capital structure and liquidity. In July, we issued a notice to redeem $200 million of our 2024 debt tower with cash on hand, which is expected to be completed by the end of September. The October 2024 debt tower would be approximately $705 million after the redemption.Since the separation in 2020, including the redemption just announced in July, we will have paid down approximately $2.15 billion of debt with cash on hand and lowered our annualized interest costs by more than $120 million. Gross debt is expected to be less than $3.8 billion after the redemption in September, while long-term debt continues to be unsecured in it fixed rates.Finally, we amended our $1 billion 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility through 2028. The amendment provides lower fees and more favorable covenants. Details can be found in the 10-Q, which is expected to be filed later today. The revolver remains undrawn.Lastly, before turning it back to John, let me highlight one item in the appendix on Slide 18. It covers our operational tax rate, which was approximately 22.6% for the quarter. The second quarter rate represents approximately a 500 basis point improvement in the operational tax rate since the separation in 2020. Now let me turn it back to John for the outlook and summary.John C. PlantThanks, Ken, and let's move to Slide #12. The outlook for Howmet continues to be very strong and supported, in particular, by the extraordinary backlog of commercial aircraft orders at both Boeing and Airbus. Demand increases have moved further to the right, constrained by current aircraft production would all go well for revenue increases to come in 2024, 2025 and beyond.This growth in absolute aircraft quantity is further enhanced by the increased sophistication of engine technology upgrades being brought to market by both GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney to the narrow-body markets. These turbine improvements address fuel efficiency and time on wing issues, which enhance the value of Howmet differentiated products. This combines well with the upcoming improvement in widebody production, which increasingly features composite technology, which again increases the value of Howmet's differentiated products of titanium structures and fasteners.Wide-body aircraft also feature improved aerospace engine content for the company. Defense markets continue to be robust, and we envisage increased revenue going into 2024 as the destocking for bulkheads is completed and engine spares continue to increase significantly as shop visits increase. The F-35 backlog continues to increase to approximately 420 aircraft with recent orders of 126 aircraft for the U.S. government joint program office, plus 25% for Israel and a further 25 aircraft for the Czech Republic.Industrial revenue continues to grow for both IGT and oil and gas, in particular. The outlook for Wheels is also healthy for the current quarter. And in Q3, underlying demand continues to be strong, albeit Q3 is notably the weakest quarter for revenue due to European vacations, which are also a feature of our aerospace plants in Europe in both France, Germany and Hungary, in particular. This seasonal effect -- the seasonal offset is seemed to be approximately $50 million of revenue between Q2 and Q3.My final markets comment is regarding spares, where we see spares of commercial aircraft closing in on 95% of the 2019 levels by year-end and approximately 130% of the defense and IGT market at 2019 levels. This puts aggregate spares for this year in excess of 2019 levels with higher rates to come as we see the rates increasing as we close out the year. The cautious stance has been taken relative to Q4 until the demand is more clear for commercial trucks in the quarter and aircraft parts for the first half of 2024. While the backlog is there, we find difficulty in planning for rate increases and the inventory impact, if that's not achieved.Specifically, we are raising guidance once again for the year by another significant step. To give you an example of guidance assumptions, we have lifted our 737 MAX assumption from 30 per month and nudged it into the 30s, but not anywhere near the rate 38 for the second half. This number is intentionally given the -- all the moving parts for the business and also the lack of clarity over very soon.And when we plan for the second half, we are increasing people recruitment further, but at a reduced rate than the first half as we hope to use the productivity improvements to come. Regarding Q3 revenue is expected to be $1.59 billion, plus or minus $10 million; EBITDA, $360 million, plus or minus $5 million; earnings per share of $0.42, plus or minus $0.01.Regarding the year, revenues increased from $6.25 billion to $6.44 billion, a significant increase. And let's say, plus or minus $30 million, $40 million around that range. And then EBITDA has increased to $1.445 billion, plus or minus $10 million. Earnings per share is increased to $1.70, plus or minus $0.01, and free cash flow is held at $635 million, having absorbed the settlement for the Lehman Brothers claim.In conclusion to my outlook commentary, we're pleased to demonstrate both excellent Q2 achievements, supplemented by further optimistic outlooks with very solid increases to come in the future. Let's move to the summary on Slide 13. Q2 was another strong quarter for Howmet. Revenue was up 18%, EBITDA 16% and earnings per share 26%. And EBITDA margin adjusted for material pass-through was strong at 22.7% and servicing continues to be heading in a healthy direction. Liquidity is healthy with very positive free cash flow with more to come in the second half, and we've continued to deploy that cash both to share repurchase in the second quarter. And as you can see, we've turned to debt repayment in the third quarter.Guidance has been increased, and we expect year-over-year improvement in annual revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share as stated. Also, we expect very positive free cash flow generation in the third and fourth quarters. Regarding debt, what we mentioned, the $200 million. And as we complete that with the EBITDA improvements, then we'll be improving our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage from the 2.5x record that we talked about in Q2 and we'll see improvements in Q3 and Q4 and heading towards 2x levered by the end of the year.And then finally, we expect to increase the quarterly common dividend by 25% from $0.04 a share to $0.05 a share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Thank you all very much. Let's move across to question and answer.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)The first question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluJohn, maybe first one for you here. Just on the incrementals as we go forward, obviously, 22% in the quarter, given structures after 25% in Q1. And you commented last quarter about how difficult it is to convert at a 30%-plus rate just given where aerospace build rates are and you'll be climbing through at least the middle of the decade here. How do you think about when you put cost into the system when it converts into higher profitability? Do you have to wait to build rates peak for that to convert to a higher operating profit than revenue?John C. PlantOkay. Thank you, Sheila. First of all, we don't have to wait, but the extraordinary levels of recruitment during the last couple of years have certainly weighed upon us. And probably of all the things that we've been doing, driving labor productivity has been amongst the most difficult. And it's certainly been more difficult than what we believe we've overcome by way of scrap and yield and also driving through on the volume.If you look at our midpoint of guidance, we believe we're going to raise the incremental to about 28% in Q3, and we are hopeful at about 34% in Q4. And that takes account of what we believe to be hopefully a slowing of recruitment and an improved retention ratios and as the denominators got bigger of the employees we've taken on. And so we're optimistic that the incremental drop-through begins to improve and then hopefully improve again in '24 with the combined volume, the pull-through from the automation programs, the -- I'd say, the bigger denominator of recently employees and the mix effective widebody.So it's a future statement. We're hopeful we're optimistic. We're planning for it, but I'll be very disappointed if we had to wait until we had stability for improvements in that drop-through.Sheila Karin KahyaogluJust a follow-up. In terms of the structures margins in the quarter, how do we think about that bumping up in the second half? How quickly does it improve?John C. PlantSo I mean, -- when I think about Howmet is more like a relentless machine. I was trying to bring color to my commentary. So the last time I tried a wet paper tissue and that didn't work so well, as you know. But at this time, I think itself Howmet fairly relentless machine rolling forward and delivering results. We're not that flash bang and full of jumping noise like Chinese firecrackers. But within the Q2, there is one thing we overcame, which I'm proud in the way we overcame it, which is the consequences of the strike in one of our suppliers of aluminum billet, and that 9-day stoppage costs us heavy and yet we marked straight through and delivered really solid margins in our wheels business.So I think that has really great performance by Howmet in that regard. Conversely, when I think of structures, we took a much bigger hit than the strike in the margin rate and the lack of achievement of the volume. And so I put that more in the, let's say, almost like a $10 million complete face plans by the business. And I just think myself, if you want to use the play on the taglines, I think, Howmet face planted in our structures business.And I'm not proud of what we really didn't achieve there. We thought we'd prepped well. We thought we'd begun to put labor in place. We thought we'd got the, I'll say, improvements made to improve throughput in our furnaces and then rolling mills and basically completely bottlenecked in one area, and it didn't work well.So -- but despite all of that, so let's call it, if you want to -- and I never like the excuse me, but a combination of structure space planting and a supplier strike, we outdelivered the guide on EBITDA. And when all said and done, any one of those is multiples. So like when we talk about margin rate of 20 basis points difference, that's worth $3 million. We felt like it's hardly worth commenting on. And so it's a bit like me saying, yes, we did really good apart from that. So I generally choose not to. But I'm trying to be responsive to your question. And I'll say, wheels did great, and structures was a big face plant.Sheila Karin KahyaogluIt's like you read my mind. I'm going to go with a relentless march rather than face plan though so...OperatorThe next question is from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.Robert Alan StallardJohn, it sound like I cut you off there. Is there something else you wanted to add?John C. PlantObviously, probably on a role and I was getting carried away. So no, I'm done.Robert Alan StallardYou can carry out how many firecrackers if you want.John C. PlantYes, I never like asking questions so, no, please start over and do your (inaudible).Robert Alan StallardOkay. Thanks for the update you noted on the 737 MAX rate assumptions. But I was wondering if you made any further changes on either Boeing or Airbus build rates within your guidance? And whether this -- in relation to that, what Airbus said about direct and indirect risk from this latest GTF issue could have any flow through to Howmet?John C. PlantYes. First of all, no rate assumption changes for elsewhere. I mean, Airbus has been, I'll say, plowing ahead, but struggling to get to their production numbers. But getting close, certainly, the Q2 deliveries was much healthier. And so I think things are getting better generally, and I think everybody is believing that we're going to see higher rate increases.And really, it's a question of when and trying to get ready for it. We think we've prepped or it. We have built capability and capacity and labor terms. We had, say, machine capacity. But as you know, on 737, originally, it's going to be Jan 1, then May 1 then July 1. And we just want to be cautious. That's why I say all we've done is just nudging into the early 30s and see where it goes and be ready, capable of supplying, but not willing to be clear we're not going to put rate 38 until it's achieved.Robert Alan StallardAnd just to follow up, anything to say on the GTF issues?John C. PlantWell, certainly, this powder metal issue that we read about it seems to be historical. I'm sure that we have got a good plan about taking those engines down out of from aircraft wing and looking at them in detail because I think (inaudible) don't work for that sort of level of crack. I think the bigger impact for Howmet is -- I might say, impact, I mean, positive, not because the impact -- the word impact has negative connotation is the time on wing issue, which is present for both current narrow bodies engines of the GTF and the LEAP-1B where -- while each of them, I think, are doing better for that relative point in their life cycle compared to the predecessor engines, I'll say, V2500 and the CFM56 is that they're still well below the exit point of the previous (inaudible) engine.And so that in itself is leading to what we believe will become increased demand for replacement parts. And also, it's combining with what I referred to maybe not in sufficient detail, which was the improvements that we have worked on to help resolve the issues. So the high-pressure turbine blades have been seeing elevated temperatures from, let's say, combustors that don't have sufficient holes left after to block them up and then causing degradation issues.And I'd say another issue particularly in, I'll say, Far East and Middle East climates for LEAP is that we are -- I describe intimate with those improvements. We have worked on them. We are prepping for their introduction and commensurate with our customers' needs. And then we are now assessing how that demand combines with the increased demand for wide-body is moving to the '24, the increased wide-body is moving to '24. And so it's all setting up well.In terms of what I think is good demand is clearly where aircraft production increases, less good demand. You could put a (inaudible) if you want to, is where it's a replacement part for a period of time. And then we are rather more cautious on that. And where we need to increase capacity rapidly to achieve that in the, say, coming months into '24 and maybe into '25 is that we certainly don't want to take capacity up and then take it back down.And therefore, we're in -- I'll say deep into commercial discussions with our customers to ensure that doesn't happen. So a long way of saying GTF powder metal, no issue for us. Nothing to do with us. And powder metal wing, it's leading to the sort of content improvement growth that we talk about as we make improvements to the -- to those turbine blades and introduce some pretty sophisticated technology as certainly indicated GTF looking at things we've done elsewhere on those engines or the more advanced engines and seeking to deploy that, which is great for the future robustness of the engine. It's fuel efficiency and also good for Howmet.OperatorThe next question is from David Strauss from Barclays.David Egon StraussSo I just wanted to clarify on the MAX. So while you've upped the guidance from 30 -- into the 30s, are you actually at 38 a month in terms of what you're shipping the Boeing today?John C. PlantIt depends upon the parts. We supply different parts. But while -- I recognize that we received schedule rate -- schedules for parts increasing to rate 38 is that my -- I'd say my scenario, which I don't like is where should they not achieve that rate, then that the parts we've supplied, I think because that will be bloated inventories, they will then take them out just in the same way as they would -- parts were taken out September, October, November, December of 2022 is that I'm blending it all together and saying, my average assumption is -- I mean the 30 is, but being deliberately loose about it, but I'm very clear that our guidance is not based upon full rate increase of 38 from the 1st of July. That's not the case.I don't believe that Boeing can do it. I'd love them to do it, but do it and then I'll feel more comfortable about our guidance to -- because I mean our guidance, I tried to describe in the past, tends to be something that you can rely upon. And I want to see aircraft reduced. And then at that point, I feel confident that we're not going to be on the wrong side of inventory takeout during the remaining few months of the year.David Egon StraussOkay. I got it. It sounds like after what you went through in Q4 of last year you're just erring on the cautious side, I got it.John C. PlantYes. I mean, Q4 last year was pretty good. The year was really good. And so it's not worrying. It's just -- I'm not putting it all out there. Why would I?David Egon StraussOkay. As a follow-up, can you dig in a little on what's going on at fasteners. I mean we've seen a pretty good revenue pickup here on the -- within the business on the aero side. I know 787 rates are still low, but kind of the drop through that we've seen there or the lack thereof in terms of the margin drop through in fasteners?John C. PlantYes. Well, don't really like using the so-called Chinese partners, but I don't really know where it's Chinese about. But the -- it begins with small steps, and our margin rate did increase in Q2, despite the large ingestation of labor for the balance of the year. It's always a bit of a hostage to fortune, but I'm feeling confident that we're going to see both revenue and margin accretion in the second half beyond Q2.So in that sense, I'm really pleased with the rate and direction of the business I wouldn't have been able to say that 6 months ago. And so I'm feeling increasingly confident that, I mean, there's be saying to you publicly, our margin rate is going to increase. So that's pretty good.OperatorThe next question is from Peter of Baird.Unidentified AnalystJohn Ken, DP. John, just within Engineered Structures, the $45 million year-to-date gain on the Russian titanium share, it seems like it's tracking right towards your expectations. So just maybe any of your updated thoughts on that? And how should we think about that as we go into next year?John C. PlantIn terms of demand, the previous metric I've given was $20 million for Q4 last year, multiply it by 4 for 2023 and then add on, I think, 25%. So that took you to around about $100 million mark. And therefore, implicit, if you did $45 million in H1, it's $55 million in H2. Right now, I'm actually feeling a little bit more confident than that. And so instead of about a 25% lift, I can see us potentially getting to a 40% lift.Certainly, I think the demand is there. So it's going to be above $100 million -- well above $100 million. And the thing that I've got to see is the structure standing up and making the stuff. And then I think we're going to realize the market share we've -- and the business we've obtained and won commercially.So at the moment, demand and, I'll say, our commercial win position is healthy. And with that -- trying to repeat myself, we had, say, a hiccup in Q2, of which neither the structures team or myself are proud of what we did or what they didn't do.OperatorThe next question is from Robert Spingarn of Melius Research.Robert Michael SpingarnFollow-up things on what you just discussed. First, on the question of the improvements to GTF and LEAP, how are these affecting or impacting your content? And how do those changes factor into your LTAs? That's the first question. And then just on the titanium. As we move further ahead, you talked about 40% uplift. But as the wide-body rates rise, let's talk about maybe 2025 when Boeing and Airbus are targeting these higher rates, I would imagine even greater uplift. Can you talk about that?John C. PlantYes, I'll do it in reverse order. So you're absolutely correct, as wide-body moves up, then that is highly beneficial for us, both for our structures business and for our fastener business, both in terms of the value delivered. And I'm going to say in the case of fasteners, the value proposition of what's delivered, where the -- I'll say the value set is substantially higher just from the additional sophistication of the fastener sets that go with combining composite skins and titanium structures.So assuming that flowing at a -- from rate 3% to 4% to 4% to 5% and then I think, higher than that in '24 and assuming they get close to the 10% or maybe by then, we'll be feeling a lot more optimistic because I think fundamental demand is above rate 10%. And similarly for the A350, that's going to go up to at least to 9% a month, I think, to meet market demand. All that is really healthy for our titanium business.And I'm expecting not just the more, I'll say, straightforward sheet and plate, but also some of the forgings, which we are able to bring to bear for that. And so it's an optimism for that. And again, if everything that we see as potentially could happen by way of volume, wide-body mix, then our structures margins, and I have commented that I do see moving towards the high teens the -- as you move to the middle or second part of the decade, and everything is there for us to do.And now just got to make it. The demand is not the issue, neither for what we've won from the titanium opportunity because of the VSMPO and tariff and restriction issues, but also the increasing demand from wide-body. In terms of the increased, I'll say, sophistication that I referred to, yes, that goes to shipset value.So as we move forward, the engine value for Howmet will increase as we move to supply the products for the changes required for the -- I'll say, the solution for the GTF issues for which we are -- the part we are playing in it, which is on the advantage engine and we'll see shipset value increase there. And similarly, for the improvements we're making on the LEAP (inaudible).As you know, normally in engines, while very long run items, we normally do upgrade about every 5 to 6 years. And so we had an upgrade plans with our customer. But the upgrades are, I'll say, a little bit more given the issues in terms of durability that have been found on, let's call it, the generation 1 parts of the turbine, not necessarily issues with our part per se, but because of basically as you drive the temperatures up because of -- and then shop last time with particulates that got through. And those are problems which require even enhanced solutions to be able to improve time on wing.OperatorThe next question is from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research.Myles Alexander WaltonJohn, I know the guidance raise on sales, you gave some color, but I was hoping you'd put a finer point on it. The $190 million did you imply as maybe $40 million or $50 million add back on wheels, a little bit on industrial and the bulk from aero, is that the way to think about the $190 million?John C. PlantI didn't really break it down. I think my aggregate feeling is we see commercial and the move the 737 rates, that's a positive assumption. Defense is proving quite robust and strong. I mean that 17% on top of what we printed in Q1 is really strong. And we are beginning to see the early stages of the defense spares increases, in particular. I think as we go through into '24 and '25, we'll begin to see spares increases for F-35 as an example.So defense has been really good for us. And I think we continue to see that. Wheels, we think, again, stronger than prior assumptions in Q3. Order books for '23 are now closed. And so we're getting a much clearer picture for the final outcomes for the '23 order book close out. And the truck manufacturers have not even opened the order book yet for '24. So we haven't got a read on that. We're hoping that they're robust.But my guesstimated picture is there'll be -- in the coming, let's say, 12 months, there'll be some weakness in the trailer market, some distribution and relative strength in the European truck market and possibly some weakness in the North American truck market. But in aggregate, slightly better than I previously anticipated.Myles Alexander WaltonAnd just a quick one on the structures bottleneck. It's good to have the assumptions that are conservative and not counting on the OEMs coming through the purchase orders. But was the bottleneck in any way a result of some hesitation to go up in rates and having to quickly than...John C. PlantNo, we added people. We're adding more people. So we're optimistic that the -- everything we got a wish for by way of, I'll say, volume requirements for our customers are there. We added the people. We spent money to increase furnace capacity. As an example, moving to triple sticks and double stick furnaces. We added some additional automation in what we thought we're improving our, I'll say, rolling mill capacity and throughput.And as I said, it didn't work out. And so I just accept that sometimes in life, things don't go exactly as planned. I said, yes, we face planted. But at least we know it and don't pretend we didn't do it, and now it's for us to stand up and do it. It's not a volume issue. It's not a demand issue. It's just -- we've got to make the stuff. And we're expecting to do so in Q3. But I guess every management says that we think we're going to do better. I mean it's always better in the future than the past. But Q2 for that business, we cannot be proud. That's for sure.OperatorThe next question is from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley.Kristine Tan LiwagJohn, on the issue that you called out on Engineered Structures, can you just provide more specific details on what caused the plant bottleneck? And then how do we think about recovery? And the other part to that would be depending on what the problem actually is, is there a risk that we could see this spread to the other segments? Like how do we think about all that?John C. PlantWell, first of all, absolutely no risk spreading to other segments. It was totally inside 1 segment, inside 1 plant. And it's not like a disease, it's not contagious. It's just for that thing at a plant. I've sort of done my best to dance around every question on this topic. And as I think it's probably getting excessive airtime for what is like irrelevant in the total results of Howmet and what we achieved, which we already exceeded everything that we said we're going to achieve.But it does come down to -- there's a huge sequencing process within -- to make titanium and in one of the early stages of that process. Our work in progress buffers broke down, and we ended up with the labor we recruited, I'll say, standing idle. The equipment wasn't working and then subsequently we stopped every subsequent process during the course of the 3 months. And so we believe we've got things back on track. I just detailed. There's like an analysis going into. Recently, again, we rereviewing it once again last week, which is my scrutiny of every work in progress -- a buffer of every important production stage for that particular product.And so in terms of daylight being the best disinfectant and a high degree of engagement by the plant management, the head of operations, the business unit leadership. And then for me to be scrutinizing, I'll say, work-in-progress buffers for each of their production stages, that's a pretty high level of scrutiny for something, which, again, while it's worthy of comment if that were to get too carried away about.So I'm hopeful it's going to respond. If it's brute force alone, it will respond. And hopefully, with a bit of sophistication as well, we might make some improvements this quarter.Kristine Tan LiwagThat's really helpful color. I mean it sounds like a very isolated issue for that specific segment. In terms of the recovery pace, like how long does this issue like this usually get resolved, like by 4Q? Is this largely resolved in your back to where you were for margins like last quarter, it was 400 to 500 basis points higher. How should we think about that pace of recovery?John C. PlantYes. I don't want to give segment commentary. But I'd be upset if we're not doing at least 10% to 15% improved volume in Q3 in that business. And assuming we do that, then we'll see a large restoration of margin because we'd work long and hard to establish that 14% as the -- let's call it, the line for that business and held it no matter what was thrown at us by way of F-35 bulkheads, 787 drop into nothing. And through thick and thin, we've done it.And then as soon as we got the volume to do what we did was not good. But at least I just think it's best to be straightforward about it and say, we didn't do good. We know what we've got to do. Everybody knows what they got to do. And we've tracked long and hard to make sure that we succeed and make substantial improvement in Q3. And then we play it again and more in Q4.OperatorThe next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen.Gautam J. KhannaI wanted to follow up, I think it was Sheila's question. Just directionally, looking at next year, in the past, you've opined on incremental margin potential, given you've already done a lot of hiring and incrementally, that's not as big of a headwind as those people get more productive and the like. And then the crosscurrents of Forged Wheels and what have you, do you have the same confidence in the 30% to 40% incrementals next year that you did kind of heading into this year? When you (inaudible) on that?John C. PlantIt's pretty, I'll say, soon to be imagining '24, so we don't make comment much on '24. I suspect that I'll give you some sort of demand outlook when we get to November time and give Q3 results. We've done that the last couple of years. And I think the most interesting question for, I'll say, when we deliver our Q3 results and decide about giving some color for '24 is like do we achieve 2019 levels of revenue? That's the most interesting question.And bear in mind, as we all know, is that there's a significant mix drag because it's not all things being equal, it's going to be all things being unequal. Wide-body will be, let's say, I don't know, a couple of hundred planes down and narrow-body might be a couple of hundred planes up, and that's probably getting towards $0.5 billion revenue drag. But can we overcome all of that with all the stuff we've been talking about in terms of, I'll say, content, price, just driving through and improving our shares and all the rest of it? And so that, for me, is the most interesting question about '24 is that do we get there? And therefore, it will be like a whole year early, I'll say, fascinating. Of course, I'm asking the question. I'm not giving you the answer because it's too early. In terms of margins, 35% plus or minus 5% was appropriate for when we were talking that clearly in -- I think it was in '21 to '22. And I'll say heading that way, maybe it's more like a 30% plus or minus for '23. Again, too early to say and it's going to depend upon hopefully seeing positive volume, combine that with productivity coming through from a more stable workforce and having really, I'll say, bore down on that problem, which for me turning like 25% of the problem belongs in the whole recruitment retention and the rest is just in fundamental productivity of the workforce as some of our parts are so sophisticated that the trading times are elevated, and therefore, we should start to see some of the benefits come through on that add together with the wide-body demand.So a lot of moving parts, Gautam. But at the moment, I think it's more like a 30% plus or minus range around it, but I don't know that yet. I mean that's no more than me thinking directionally where are we without any benefit of any detailed financial analysis, and therefore, it's just talking with you.Gautam J. KhannaI appreciate that. And just as part of that, how do you think pricing changes year-to-year, just...John C. PlantWe haven't told you Q2 yet. Nobody's asked the question. But Q2, everything was in line with what we've said before and the year is in line with what we said before and our Q will be published this afternoon, and you'll be able to see it. And so everything is in order on that front.'23 now is essentially completed for negotiations. So again, all in order, and '24 is coming rapidly into focus and commensurate with what I said on the last call is that '24 is going to be similar and good, it's similar and good.OperatorThe next question is from Ronald Epstein of Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinSo I think pretty much everything has been asked. So maybe just a quick follow-on here. When rates actually get to 38 or maybe way down the road, they get to 50 or higher on 737s, how should we think about the evolution of incrementals then? Because I think that's on the top of a lot of investors' minds because it can help draw out the trajectory of where earnings and cash flow for the company could ultimately go as the ramp goes?John C. PlantYes. I think the most difficult thing that we've -- ultimately, if you look through all the issues we faced of stop start, stop start, supply chain, labor, COVID -- all post-Covid and all those things that have -- if they tested us over the last, let's say, 2 or 3 years, then I think when I bring it right down to how do we now see it as we've grappled each one of them that fundamental labor productivity has probably been the most difficult for us in what's -- parts of our business have extremely high learning curves and to stabilize that, deliver good quality to our customers, which is paramount, we're trying very hard on that front and to meet schedule.And I think that we've heard very little from the industry about any inability to Howmet not to meet customers' needs. So thing that labor productivity into place, seeing everything smooth out. And I'm hopeful that as Boeing moves towards achieving the 737 at rate 50, as Airbus move from the, let's call it, early 50s through to something towards rate 75 is that's going to help smooth out things and will be in a much improved condition to deliver at a higher productive level.Similarly with the wide-body increases. So I've used a phrase which I'm not sure how apt it really is, but call it state of grace. And I do see that maybe as we move into the second half of '24, we get close to that state of grace where productivity is smoothed out, production volumes increasing, content increasing, pricing in the right shape. And so then we begin to print optimal margins and cash flow and hopefully just continue to then improve as a further rate increase in '25 and '26.So everything tells me we should be fundamentally optimistic. At the same time, we've currently got issues to overcome, of which I think that labor is used -- is the most -- been the most protracted.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session and today's conference.

Boeing also outlined plans to increase production of its popular 737 MAX narrowbody jet.Shares were retreating 1% in recent premarket trading after their earnings-triggered surge last week.Goldman Sachs upgraded to Neutral Atlantic Equities upgraded Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to Neutral from Underweight and raised its price target to $350.00 from $330.00.The firm remarked that despite the weak Q2 last month, with EPS down by 60% compared to the previous year, there were positive indicators for Goldman Sachs, such as a 22% year-over-year growth in Equities financing, continued robust growth in Platform Solutions revenues, and effective expense control (excluding impairments).The strength in the S&amp;P 500 YTD also provides a better jumping-off point for asset management revenues in Q3.Story continuesShares ticked up 0.5% on Tuesday to $357.72.3 more upgradesJPMorgan upgraded KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) to Neutral from Underweight and raised its price target to $13.00 from $11.50, noting it sees less risk of an imminent dividend cut.Previously, the Underweight thesis was driven by concerns that KeyCorp faced an elevated risk of reducing its common dividend due to new capital rules for banks with assets over $100B and its relatively high dividend yield. However, with the new capital proposals allowing banks until mid-2028 to achieve full compliance and a longer timeline than anticipated, KeyCorp now has more flexibility and time to manage this situation without the risk of a common dividend cut.Baird upgraded Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $137.00 from $89.00.Shares jumped more than 10% yesterday after the company reported better-than-expected Q2 results and raised its full-year guidance.Q2 results demonstrated clear evidence of operational improvement in Vocational with the AeroTech deal closed and Defense turning the corner as well; the earnings ramp potential of the two segments will provide important offsets should Access trends soften, while driving meaningful profit growth should Access prove better than feared.RBC Capital upgraded ResMed (NYSE:RMD) to Outperform from Sector Perform and raised its price target to $284.00 from $262.00, noting it believes the company has an attractive risk/reward profile.RBC’s outlook for ResMed is positive due to several factors, including the low OSA penetration rates, improvements in the supply chain of component parts, a backlog of rePAP customers, and the company's strong market position.

Despite ongoing challenges, both executives highlighted positive developments and outlined their plans for improving earnings. Boeing faced a barrage of questions from analysts eager to understand the company's financial performance and future outlook. The call, which took place on July 26,saw analysts from various firms seeking clarity on key issues affecting the aerospace giant.Boeing's CEO and CFO optimistic about earnings recoveryWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with BA. Click here to check it out. BA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of BAWest began by discussing the company's total financial performance. He reported that second-quarter revenue reached $19.8 billion, marking an 18% year-over-year increase. This growth was primarily driven by higher commercial volume, including increased deliveries of the 787 aircraft. However, the core operating margin remained at -2%, and the core loss per share was 82 cents. West attributed these figures to expected abnormal costs, period expenses and losses on three fixed price development programs in the defense business.Boeing Is Optimistic, but Analysts Aren't CertainDespite these challenges, West emphasized the positive aspects of Boeing's financials. He highlighted the significant improvement in free cash flow, which reached $2.6 billion, driven by higher commercial deliveries and favorable receipt timing. West also mentioned that the strong order activity resulted in over $2 billion of favorable advanced payment timing, which was expected to occur in the third quarter.Progress in commercial airplanesMoving on to commercial airplanes, West discussed the progress made in the quarter. The business booked 460 net orders, including significant orders from Air India, Riyadh Air and Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY). The backlog now stands at over 4,800 airplanes valued at $363 billion. Although the operating margin for the segment remained negative at -4.3%, West noted it was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. He attributed the negative margin to expected abnormal costs, period expenses and higher research and development spending. He assured investors that the company was making steady progress in addressing operational challenges and would focus on stability as it aimed to increase production on key programs.Story continuesDefense and space segmentIn the defense and space segment, West acknowledged the operating margin remained at -8.5%, primarily due to three fixed-price development programs. However, he expressed confidence in the portfolio's strong demand and the company's ability to return to high single-digit margins by 2025-26.Overall, both Calhoun and West remained optimistic about Boeing's future. They highlighted the strong demand across key programs and services, with commercial demand remaining robust and defense demand continuing to progress as expected. They acknowledged the supply-constrained environment, but assured investors that the company was focused on execution and steadily increasing production.Analysts seek clarity on Boeing's financial performance and future outlookSheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies kicked off the question and answer session, inquiring about Boeing's commercial airplanes operating loss of $383 million in the quarter. She sought to understand the factors that would drive a turnaround and when the operating margins would turn positive. She specifically mentioned production rates, abnormal cost concessions and pricing as potential drivers. West responded to Kahyaoglu's question, acknowledging the negative operating margins but expressing confidence in sequential improvement. He highlighted that the third quarter would still see some negativity, but expected positive margins by the end of the year or early next year. West attributed this optimism to factors such as rate ramp, the resolution of abnormal costs and a favorable pricing environment.Cai von Rumohr from Cowen followed up on Kahyaoglu's question, expressing concern about Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security programs' underperformance. He questioned the impact of fixed-price contracts and whether any contracts would reach their end, allowing for better pricing going forward. Boeing's CEO acknowledged the challenges posed by the fixed-price contracts, but expressed confidence in overcoming them. He assured analysts that the products delivered would perform as expected or even better.Queries on 737 deliveries and 787 programMyles Walton from Wolfe Research asked about Boeing's expected improvement in 737 deliveries for the second half of the year. West confirmed they expect the second half to be better and that they are always striving to sequentially improve. However, he did not provide specific details on the factors contributing to the expected improvement.Seth Seifman from JPMorgan focused on the 787 program and asked about potential supply chain issues. Calhoun mentioned the supply chain is getting better and more stable, indicating there have been improvements in coordination. However, he did not provide specific details on any potential supply chain issues.Seifman also sought insights into delivery expectations for the following year. West stated that it is not the right time to discuss delivery numbers for the next year. He emphasized the importance of sequential improvement and expressed confidence in the 787 program, mentioning the team is steadily working toward production rate increases.David Strauss from Barclays raised concerns about slow 787 deliveries in July and rumors of new issues affecting the program. Calhoun did not directly address the rumors of new issues. However, he mentioned the 787 program is on the right path and that the team is steadily increasing production rates. He expressed confidence in reaching the delivery guidance for the year and highlighted the progress being made in the program.Calhoun concluded the earnings call by reiterating their commitment to meaningful operating performance improvement, including deliveries, revenue, margins and cash flow. He emphasized that despite the challenges, Boeing is heading in the right direction and expects operational and financial performance to continue accelerating, aligning with the plan laid out in its Investor Day last November. With a target of $10 billion of free cash flow in 2025-26, Boeing's leadership expressed confidence in the company's ability to recover and thrive in the coming years.Boeing Is Optimistic, but Analysts Aren't CertainMy takeBoeing's second-quarter earnings call provided valuable insights into its financial performance and future outlook. Analysts sought answers to pressing questions, and the company's executives provided reassurance, highlighting their confidence in overcoming challenges and delivering positive results in the coming months.The analysts' response was somewhat negative. In the past week, three analysts have lowered their estimates for 2023, but their estimates for 2024 have remained relatively unchanged. This aligns with my opinion of the call. No significant new information was disclosed, either positive or negative, but Boeing needs to increase production and become profitable again. When we consider the six analyst downward revisions in the last 30 days, it is clear that Boeing is not a value stock and should only be considered by those willing to take on substantial risk in their portfolio.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

PWR is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.7% and 8.4%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, although total revenues increased 11.7%, earnings declined 8.1%.Encouragingly, earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 15 of the trailing 16 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) remained unchanged at $1.67 over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates an 8.4% increase from the year-ago EPS of $1.54. The consensus mark for revenues is $4.69 billion, suggesting a 10.9% year-over-year rise.Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteThe development and deployment of technology solutions across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as all facets of infrastructure for providing carbon-free energy solutions, are likely to have benefited Quanta Services in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has been capitalizing on the megatrends to lead the energy transition and enable technological development. Initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining momentum. These factors are likely to have helped the company to boost its profit level to some extent.Segment-wise, the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment (which accounted for 52.4% of total revenues in 2022) is likely to have benefited from broad-based business strength, driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid execution. Also, contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from the acquired businesses are likely to have supported bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.From a seasonality perspective, PWR expects segment revenues to grow sequentially in the quarter. It also expects operating margin to be slightly pressured in the second quarter due to challenging weather conditions in the northern and western parts of North America, comparable to segment margins in the second quarter of 2022.    For the Electric Power segment, we expect revenues to grow 9.1% year over year to $2,400.2 million from a year ago. Operating margin is expected to be 9.9% in the quarter, down from 10.6% a year ago.The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment (which accounted for 25.5% of total revenues in 2022) has been benefiting from higher demand for gas utility and pipeline integrity services and pent-up demand for the services that were deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market. From a seasonality perspective, PWR anticipates second-quarter revenues to grow sequentially. Second-quarter margins are expected to show solid improvement.For the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment, our model predicts revenues to decline 1.5% year over year to $1,091.6 million from a year ago. Operating margin is expected to be 7.7% in the quarter, down from 8.1% a year ago.Meanwhile, the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment (22.1%) — consists of services and solutions for infrastructure supporting the delivery of renewable energy — including renewable generation, electric transmission, substations and battery storage, with Blattner's operations representing the majority of those solutions. This addition is expected to have contributed to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.From a seasonality perspective, the company expects segment revenues in the quarter to grow sequentially. It also expects segment margins for the quarter to be in the upper-single digits, slightly below the second quarter of 2022.For the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment, our model predicts revenues to grow 20.6% year over year to $1,114.7 million from a year ago. Operating margin is expected to be 8.6% in the quarter, down from 8.8% a year ago.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Quanta Services this time around.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 74 cents per share on revenues of $6.8 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the June quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q1 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark due to the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of 79 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. However, revenues of $6.5 billion came in 2.7% below the consensus mark, affected by tepid demand on the back of unfavorable weather.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter bottom line has been revised 1.4% upward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 30.8% decline year over year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a 5.4% decrease from the year-ago period. Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added more than 11,000 new residential electric customers and in excess of 6,000 residential natural gas customers in the first quarter of 2023. This trend most likely continued in the April-June period of 2023 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s fuel and retail electric sales in the second quarter might have been affected by tepid weather, which translates into lesser use of natural gas required to run electricity generators. This, in turn, is likely to have dragged down overall sales. In particular, our estimate for operating revenue is pegged at $6.5 billion, indicating a 9.7% drop from $7.2 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

This is depicted in the chart below:The Cigna Group Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Group Price and EPS SurpriseThe Cigna Group price-eps-surprise | The Cigna Group QuoteFactors to NoteIn the second quarter, revenues of Cigna are likely to have benefited on the back of solid pharmacy revenues stemming from a well-performing specialty pharmacy business within the Evernorth Health Services segment. The unit is also expected to have gained on new client wins and strong customer retention rates coupled with strong contributions by the Express Scripts business.We expect pharmacy revenues of CI to be $33.6 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, which indicates an improvement of 5% year over year. Our estimate for adjusted revenues of the Evernorth segment stands at $36.4 billion, suggesting 4.5% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.A growing customer base within the U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses is expected to have provide an impetus to the performance of the Cigna Healthcare segment in the second quarter. A diversified and cost-effective health plan suite, as well as the roll out of such plans across different geographic regions, are likely to have fetched customer wins to Cigna in the to-be-reported quarter.We estimate total medical customers of Cigna to be nearly 19 million as of Jun 30, 2023, up 6.6% year over year. Our estimate for adjusted revenues of the Cigna Healthcare segment stands at $11.8 billion, which implies 4.2% growth year over year.However, a decline in net investment income is likely to have been roadblocks to Cigna’s revenue growth in the second quarter. We expect net investment income to decline 24.2% year over year.Its margins are expected to have suffered a blow due to an elevated medical cost level. This, in turn, is likely to have led to a higher medical care ratio (MCR) of Cigna in the to-be-reported quarter. We expect medical costs and other benefit expenses to increase 2.7% year over year. Our estimate for MCR stands at 81.2% in the second quarter, which indicates a deterioration of 50 basis points year over year.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Cigna this time around.

However, in Greater China, sales rose 24% as a rebound in demand boosted consumer spending after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.""There are issues with the branding itself in wholesale and there seem to be issues with the direct-to-consumer segment as well,"" said Jane Hali &amp; Associates senior analyst Jessica Ramirez.The company's sneakers are not really resonating with consumers as they used to and it feels like its overall strategy has lagged, she said.Denver, Colorado-based VF Corp reported a 6% and 22% fall in its Timberland and Vans brands respectively, while The North Face brand saw a 12% increase.It has increased promotional activity in an attempt to offload excess inventory and spur demand. This resulted in its adjusted gross margin for the first quarter coming in at 52.8%, down 130 basis points.The company forecast annual revenue to be down-to-flat for the year, compared to a previous expectation of flat-to-slightly up.VF Corp maintained its annual profit forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share. It also posted a bigger-than-expected adjusted first-quarter loss per share of 15 cents, compared to an estimate of 11 cents.Revenue in the first quarter fell 8%, to $2.09 billion in the quarter ended July 1, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.07 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Shares of the company were up marginally in aftermarket trading.(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)]"

Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by VF from translating its foreign revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on reported operating results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. We use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of changes in the rates used to calculate foreign currency translation. Management believes this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparison of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses.To calculate foreign currency translation on a constant currency basis, operating results for the current year period for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable period of the prior year (rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current year period).These constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.VF CORPORATIONSupplemental Financial InformationReconciliation of Select GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures - Three Months Ended June 2023(Unaudited)(In thousands, except per share amounts)Three Months Ended June 2023As Reportedunder GAAPTransaction and Deal Related Activities (a)AdjustedRevenues$2,086,336$—$2,086,336Gross profit1,101,067—1,101,067Percent52.8%52.8%Operating loss(8,992)1,118(7,874)Percent(0.4)%(0.4)%Diluted net loss per share (b)(0.15)—(0.15)(a) Transaction and deal related activities reflect activities associated with the review of strategic alternatives for the Global Packs business, consisting of the Kipling®, Eastpak® and JanSport® brands, which totaled $1.1 million for the three months ended June 2023.

Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 3 and additional information regarding these statements, and our non-GAAP financial measures is available on our earnings release in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Information and factors that may affect future results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.Albert BourlaThank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter financial results were solid and in line with our expectations. Non-COVID-19 revenues grew 5% operationally compared to the year ago quarter. Total revenue declined 53% operationally, primarily due to the anticipated revenue declines in both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY. Even with these declines, our COVID-19 portfolio remains a significant contributor to the business with more than $1.6 billion in combined revenue during this quarter. Of course, our patient impact data are equally important because patients are the reason we exist. Through the first 6 months of the year, more than 356 million patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines.We continue to make progress towards our goal of executing an unprecedented number of launches of new products or indications. In fact, Pfizer is more than halfway of its goal of launching 19 new products or indications in 18 months' time. In addition to the 6 approvals and 5 launches that occurred prior to 2023, we have 6 approvals and 4 launches in the first 6 months of 2023. For the second half of 2023, we expect 6 additional approvals and 6 additional launches, including the 2 launches that occurred in July.Then in 2024, we expect 1 approval and 4 launches which, if approved and recommended, would raise the total to 19 new launches in approximately 18 months. As you can see in this chart, for this year's launches, we expect the revenue contribution to occur largely in the second half of 2023 because the first half launches occurred late in the second quarter. And then in 2024, with the additional impact of next year's expected launches, we anticipate an even greater total contribution for our 19 launches. It is important to note that 18 of the 19 potential launches have been largely derisked from a technical perspective at this point, with the only 1 remaining being our RNA flu candidate.Equally encouraging is that our pipeline is expected to contribute -- continue generating breakthrough treatments and vaccines long after the 19 we have been discussing. We recently reported milestones from several exciting pipeline candidates with the potential to be significant future value drivers. These include: Phase III data from marstacimab, a novel antibody being studied for the treatment of hemophilia A and B; regulatory filing acceptance of our hemophilia B gene therapy candidate; the publication in the New England Journal of Medicine of Phase II results for our vaccine candidate for maternal immunization against Group B streptococcus; and first-in-human data from our pipeline of potential next-generation breast cancer treatments, including our novel CDK4, CDK2 and KAT6 inhibitors.Now I would like to provide some commentary on our COVID-19 portfolio. As you all know, during the pandemic, Pfizer demonstrated impressively the power of our research and manufacturing capabilities by bringing to the world the first and most widely used vaccine and oral treatment for COVID-19. These scientific breakthroughs have played a significant role in bringing the global health crisis under control, and we are very proud of our contribution. The profits that these products have generated today have enabled us to invest in acquiring Arena, ReViral, Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics, which together, we expect to contribute approximately $10 billion of revenues in year 2030. In fact, the acquisitions of Biohaven and Global Blood Therapeutics are already contributing to our operational growth, while the acquisition of Arena is expected to start generating revenues toward the end of this year. We also remain very excited about our planned acquisition of Seagen, which if approved, is expected to contribute more than $10 billion in 2030 revenues. As a result of the positive momentum of our non-COVID-19 revenues and more importantly, the success of our COVID-19 portfolio, Pfizer's overall revenues have increased exponentially compared with our 2019 revenues, pro forma for the divestitures of Upjohn and our Consumer business. This allowed us to increase investments in R&amp;D and SI&amp;A to support this new revenue base and our expected new product launches.The increased investments we are making in R&amp;D and SI&amp;A this year were sized based on certain revenue assumptions we made in January for both our COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 products. These assumptions also were incorporated in our 2023 financial guidance. Clear, there is a higher level of uncertainty regarding the demand projections for our COVID-19 products than for the rest of our business. For example, in January, we shared our expectation that approximately 100 million doses of COVID-19 would be administered in the U.S. this year, of which we estimated Pfizer to capture 60% market share. In the first 6 months of 2023, 12.4 million doses were administered in the U.S. While the 12.4 million doses are behind our earlier projections, our market share for COVID-19 is ahead of our previous expectations at 65%. However, the vast majority of respiratory vaccinations happened during the fall and winter respiratory disease season, which starts in September, and we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to follow this pattern going forward. The uncertainty of the exact timing of COMIRNATY commercialization was largely removed with the decision by the FDA and CDC to request a change in the composition of the vaccine to address the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. We believe this will allow us to commercialize the vaccine in September, assuming the updated vaccines are approved and available by the end of August, of course. In the European Union, the uncertainty regarding the vaccine's revenue contributions for '23 and beyond was removed when we renegotiated successfully our long-term agreement. This agreement spread the agreed volumes over 4 years. And while it puts pressure on this year's volumes, we believe it also provides longer-term revenue certainty in this important market.Similar to what we are experiencing with the vaccine, the second half of the year will play a bigger role in informing our expectations for the long-term demand of PAXLOVID, the utilization of which follows very closely the COVID-19 infection rates. We expect a new COVID-19 wave to start in the U.S. this fall, and this expectation is supported by the increase in infection rates we are already seeing. Obviously, the severity of disease and people's desire for treatment also will be factors, as will the ongoing dialogue with the U.S. government regarding when we will transition to a commercial model for PAXLOVID. These are the uncertainties.We are acutely aware that all these uncertainties are making it difficult to project the future revenues of Pfizer in this area and largely Pfizer, and also affecting our stock price as a result. The good news is we will have much more clarity and certainty regarding how our COVID-19 products will perform in the commercial market by the time we report our third quarter financial results. And we expect the uncertainties to be largely eliminated by the end of the year. This is because we expect the vaccination and treatment rates from the upcoming respiratory disease season to be a reliable predictor of trends in subsequent years, with some potential upside, of course, if a combination flu and COVID-19 vaccine is brought to market in the future. Additionally, by that point, the timing of transitioning to full commercialization of both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID should become clear. Despite this uncertainty, we'll continue to invest in our COVID-19 portfolio this year, in advance of the upcoming respiratory disease season. This is very important. But given the uncertainty, we are also preparing to have the ability to adjust our 2024 total cost base to align with various future COVID-19 disease -- revenue scenarios. In fact, we've already identified specific areas where we can make adjustments, primarily within our COVID-19 cost base, if demand comes in lower than expected. Dave will provide more details during his remarks. Next, I wanted to share a few quick updates of our planned acquisition of Seagen, which we believe will be a major driver of our future success. Seagen's shareholders recently overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition, and we have already raised most of the external financing needed to fund the transaction. We also continue to work closely with regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission. In the meantime, our integration planning continues, which will allow us to hit the ground running following an anticipated close later in 2023 or early in 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.Last week, we announced that Chris Boshoff has joined Pfizer's executive leadership team as Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President, reporting directly to me. In this role, Chris will lead a new end-to-end Oncology R&amp;D organization and be the single point of accountability for the entire oncology pipeline from discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development. This is similar to the structure we currently have in place for our Vaccines R&amp;D organization, which has proven to be very productive. Pfizer and Seagen serve a common vision to deliver life-saving treatments for people living with cancer, which is why I'm so pleased that after closing, Chris' Oncology leadership team will include talented, purpose-driven and highly productive leaders from both companies. And we made already announcements about the people that are joining Chris' leadership team. We believe this new structure will help further accelerate the delivery of cancer therapies, which is critical because in the battle against cancer, time is life. At Pfizer, one of core business principles is the belief that trust is everything. I'm proud to share that in recent months, we have received some wonderful accolades that speak to the trust we are building with external stakeholders. We were named one of the '23-'24 Best Companies to Work For by U.S. News &amp; World Report. We were listed in Newsweek's List of America's Greatest Workplaces 2023. For the third year in a row, Pfizer has earned a top 100 score in the 2023 Disability Equality Index. And our own Rady Johnson received the Disability:IN '23 Executive Sponsor of the Year Award at the National Conference in July. And lastly, our PGS site in Ascoli, Italy is being recognized by the United Nations for the Welcome Award - Working for Refugee Integration. These recognitions are very important because they strengthen the unprecedented brand equity that Pfizer built during the COVID-19 pandemic.Before I hand it over to Dave, I want to quickly comment on the situation at our facility in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First, all of us at Pfizer were relieved that no colleagues were seriously injured when the tornado struck. That said, our facility sustained substantial damage as did the neighborhoods where many of our colleagues live, unfortunately. The local leadership team has done an incredible job responding to this devastating event. And we are proceeding with both urgency and caution to determine the best way to get the site back online as quickly as possible so as to minimize any impact on patients. Of course, we are also taking steps to ensure the continued safety of our colleagues and contractors, which remains our top priority. And with that, I will now turn it over to Dave, and after Dave, Mikael will provide an update on our R&amp;D pipeline. Dave?David M. DentonThank you, Albert, and good morning to everyone. Over the past 24 months, Pfizer has made important investments to position it squarely on track to achieve profitable and sustainable growth, particularly in the back half of this decade. We have strategically invested to expand our commercial portfolio and our late-stage pipeline, strengthened our market launch capabilities and enhanced innovation through internal R&amp;D and business development actions. These deliberate efforts continue to solidify Pfizer's ability to overcome upcoming LOEs and drive sustainable revenue growth, all while enhancing long-term shareholder value. To further support our long-term growth objectives, we are executing a capital allocation strategy designed to effectively deploy our cash. Our strategy is focused on 3 main pillars: first is reinvesting in our business; second is growing our dividends over time; and finally, making value-enhancing share repurchases. In the first half of 2023 alone, we've invested $5.2 billion in internal R&amp;D, returned $4.6 billion to shareholders via our quarterly dividend and allocated approximately $43 billion towards the proposed acquisition of Seagen. During the second quarter, Pfizer successfully completed a $31 billion unsecured debt offering across 8 tranches. The net proceeds of this debt offering will be used to substantially fund the Seagen acquisition. The new debt carried a weighted average yield of 4.93% and a weighted average maturity of 16.3 years, consistent with our expectations. On a full year run rate basis, the annual financing cost associated with the acquisition is expected to be nearly $2 billion. With the completion now of this debt offering, the company is positioned to close the Seagen acquisition immediately upon post-regulatory approvals. While we plan to continue investing in our business, we expect to delever our capital structure following the closing of the Seagen transaction. As we delever, it is our expectation to return to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, inclusive of share repurchases. Now with that, let me briefly cover a few highlights of our quarterly financial performance. As Albert said, our Q2 results were solid and in line with our expectations from both the top and a bottom line perspective, albeit slightly better than EPS consensus. As expected in our guidance, our overall Q2 revenue declined 53% operationally. The contraction in revenue was driven by the anticipated decline in both PAXLOVID and COMIRNATY sales. We expect these products to transition to a commercial market in the second half of this year. Our operational revenue growth, excluding our COVID products was in line with expectations at 5% versus Q2 of LY, with strong contributions from the inclusion of both NURTEC and Oxbryta as well as the continued growth from the VYNDAQEL family. During Q2, adjusted SI&amp;A expenses were $3.4 billion and grew 20% operationally versus LY. We continue to invest in support of our upcoming launches and grow our recently acquired products. While it's clear that these near-term investments are dampening our current profitability levels, we are laser-focused on maximizing the longer-term performance of these products.Now moving to the bottom line, reported diluted earnings per share this quarter declined by 77% to $0.41, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 declined 65% on an operational basis. Earnings compressed at a greater rate than revenues, primarily due to the steep and anticipated contraction in PAXLOVID sales during the quarter. Once again, foreign exchange movements continue to unfavorably impact our results, reducing second quarter revenues by approximately $280 million or 1% and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 or 2% compared to last year. Now that we are at the halfway point of our 2023 financial plan, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on how we are executing across our business while navigating within an incredibly unique and dynamic environment. As a management team, we remain committed to transparency and sharing our assessment of the evolving marketplace, given the magnitude of launches, the ongoing shifting nature of the COVID landscape and the continued integration of acquired assets. Let me begin by elaborating on our full year '23 financial guidance. We are narrowing our expectations for revenues to between $67 billion and $70 billion and maintaining guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.45 for the full year. For our more durable and predictable non-COVID revenues, we are updating our guidance range to 6% to 8% operational revenue growth. From a launch timing standpoint, I'll point out that the majority of our 2023 launches are anticipated to occur in the second half of 2023, and our commercialization schedule remains materially unchanged. As a company, we always strive to achieve the highest revenue level possible while maintaining a realistic view of the key input that inform our outlook. Regarding RSV for older adults, the shared decision-making recommendation by ACIP is likely to slow its near-term uptake in the U.S. In addition, the recent approval of TALZENNA in the U.S. results in a more narrow patient population than originally planned. These factors, coupled with the impact of the damaged Rocky Mount manufacturing facility presents near-term revenue challenges. However, we expect positive revenue momentum as we exit 2023 and head in 2024. And importantly, the long-term outlook for our non-COVID business remains intact relative to our 2030 ambitions. Turning now to our less predictable and more variable COVID portfolio. Year-to-date, we have booked slightly over 40% of the $21.5 billion full year revenue forecast for both COMIRNATY and PAXLOVID with the important fall vaccination and respiratory infection season ahead of us. We are acutely aware that COVID demand depends on many evolving market variables, making the range of potential revenue outcomes increasingly large and difficult to predict with certainty. These variables include the overall level of vaccination and infection rates, the speed of drawdown in government inventory levels and the mutating nature of the virus itself, just to name a few. In the interest of public health and with the important fall season ahead of us, we are maintaining our COVID revenue outlook for the year while continuing to invest largely on a variable expense basis to support our COVID products in 2023. These variable investments are important to support our efforts to reach as many patients as possible, helping to ensure that the most at-risk individuals are both vaccinated and treated while maintaining our leading market share. We are proud of what we have achieved through the COVID portfolio, and this has allowed the company to invest in support of its growth agenda for the back half of this decade. Our visibility into future COVID revenues and demands should improve throughout the remainder of 2023 as we gain clarity on a more typical annual run rate. We are well aware that our 2023 profit outlook is currently being dampened by incremental cost in support of our launches as well as higher R&amp;D investments aligned with the company's current revenue base. We remain committed to both defending and growing our overall level of profitability. As Albert mentioned earlier, we expect this fall's performance of our COVID-19 products to help us more effectively forecast future sales performance. To that end, if our COVID-19 revenues are less than what we have assumed, we are prepared to launch an enterprise-wide cost improvement program aligned with the longer-term revenue projections for our business. This program will be designed to support our objective of growing our operating profit margin and we'd expect to begin to yield results in 2024. And we look forward to sharing the specific details of this program in our upcoming earnings call. In closing, this is an extraordinary time for Pfizer. Our confidence and our commitment to our strategy and to achieving our 2030 goals is unwavering. We will continue to focus our efforts to drive growth while enhancing long-term shareholder value.And with that, let me now turn it over to Mikael.Mikael DolstenThank you, Dave. Today, I will provide updates on a few different therapeutic focus areas, starting with breast cancer. We are working to deliver the next wave of innovative therapies for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. The pillars of this strategy are threefold: establishing our investigational CDK4 inhibitor as a next-generation cell cycle therapy backbone, establishing vepdegestrant as the next-generation endocrine therapy backbone; and establishing novel mechanisms like our investigational CDK2 inhibitor and KAT6 inhibitor candidate as next-gen combination partners to enhance efficacy. Our clinical strategy entails first, developing assets for the metastatic setting, in which IBRANCE is currently the leader and unmet need is high, followed by an opportunity to expand to earlier-stage breast cancer, including the CDK4/6-naive population and adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings.Data presented at ASCO from 3 key investigational medicines from our next-gen portfolio demonstrated antitumor activity heavily pretreated populations for patients with breast cancer. As a reminder, the majority of hormone receptor positive breast cancers express low CDK6, while CDK4 is likely to be a major cell cycle driver. We have seen that CDK4/6 inhibition can lead to neutropenia, which requires more frequent blood test monitoring, mostly driven by CDK6 inhibition. Across the CDK4/6 inhibitor class, approximately 30% to 60% of patients experience severe neutropenia.On the left, in a Phase I dose escalation study in patients with hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer, all of whom have previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor, treatment with our CDK4 inhibitor in combination with endocrine therapy resulted in a confirmed objective response rate of 29%, clinical benefit response rate of 52% and a median progression-free survival of nearly 25 weeks. The combination was well tolerated, which may enable maximum CDK4 inhibition. We are actively planning the Phase III randomized study. In addition, I'd like to highlight encouraging data from the Phase I dose escalation study of our novel CDK2 inhibitor, which showed monotherapy activity, including confirmed partial responses in breast cancer patients who had previously received a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Also, durable confirmed clinical responses were observed in a Phase I trial of our novel KAT6 inhibitor as a monotherapy and in combination with endocrine therapy in heavily pretreated patients with breast cancer. Turning now to blood cancer. ELREXFIO, also known as elranatamab, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be the anchor of an anticipated multibillion-dollar franchise. An FDA decision for the potential first indication in the triple-class relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population is expected this year, and we continue to advance the MagnetisMM clinical programs to expand into earlier lines of treatment. In addition, development of maplirpacept, also known as TTI-622, is underway, including in combination with ELREXFIO to support potential mutations in myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we show ELREXFIO data presented at EHA from the MagnetisMM-3 trial in patients with triple-class refractory multiple myeloma who had no prior exposure to BCMA-directed therapy. On the left, we observed highly meaningful survival with ELREXFIO monotherapy with a 15-month overall survival of 57%. In patients who achieved a complete response, 15-month survival was remarkably 93%, underscoring the potential for deep and durable responses. We can see evidence of broad activity in multiple myeloma on the right, with the graph showing a single agent complete response rate of 35%, which rises to 46% in the subset of patients with 2 to 3 therapy. Our ongoing randomized trials are in less pretreated to newly diagnosed population. Subject to approval, ELREXFIO may have key differentiators such as 50% low hospitalization time during the step-up dosing period per protocol and an extended dosing interval that moves from once weekly to every other week dosing beyond week 24. Turning now to hemophilia A and B, the pivotal trial of marstacimab met its primary endpoint with statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on annualized bleeding rate or ABR. There was a 35% reduction in ABR compared to prophylactic factor replacement and 92% reduction in ABR versus on-demand factor replacement. Marstacimab offers a differentiated mechanism of action and dosing regimen compared to standard-of-care therapy. If approved, it has the potential to be the first once-weekly subcu hemophilia B treatment for patients without inhibitors and the first hemophilia A or B treatment administered in a patient-friendly pen as a flat dose. Regulatory submission is expected in the second half of '23. Next, LITFULO, also known as ritlecitinib, is the first medicine to receive FDA approval to treat severe alopecia areata in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older. It also recently received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's CHMP recommending body, but it's not yet approved. It has the potential to redefine the standard of care for alopecia areata. LITFULO is the first-of-its-kind kinase inhibitor with a unique mechanism that inhibits both the TEC kinase family and transiently JAK3 pathways that have been implicated in the alopecia areata pathophysiology. In addition, we're exploring how its unique mechanism of action could potentially be applied across immune disorders, including vitiligo, in which a Phase III study is ongoing, and other potential indications. Finally, we're making excellent progress on the milestones we have set out through the first half of '24. As Albert noted, we recently received FDA approval for Prevnar 20 in the pediatric population. We have robust strategies in place to potentially improve the protection provided by current pneumococcal vaccines. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters.In addition, we recently published Phase II data in New England Journal Medicine, showing our Group B streptococcus maternal vaccine candidate was generally well tolerated and generated robust antibody levels. The Journal also published a natural history study, which was used to determine protective antibody levels at birth. These 2 studies indicated that the vaccine candidate may offer meaningful protection to infants born to immunized mothers. We were highly encouraged that Dr. Carol Baker, an infectious disease expert from the University of Texas Health Science Center, wrote an independent NEJM editorial highlighting the important future prospects of our GBS vaccine candidate. The progress of the GBS vaccine candidate dovetails nicely with the positive result and anticipated upcoming regulatory decision for our RSV vaccine ABRYSVO for administration to pregnant women. ABRYSVO recently received a positive opinion from European Medicines Agency's CHMP for both older adults and maternal immunization to help protect infants. ABRYSVO is approved for older adults all in the U.S. and under regulatory review for the maternal indication. In addition, we remain excited to see the Phase II data from danuglipron by end of '23, which we expect will enable us to finalize our Phase III plan. Finally, I'll call out the Phase III trial start of our anti-interferon beta candidate for the treatment of inflammatory muscle myopathies, which has received Fast Track designation from FDA.Thank you. Let me turn it over to Chris to start the Q&amp;A session.Christopher J. StevoThank you, Mikael. Chelsea, if you could please queue up the callers. We have at least 30 minutes for our Q&amp;A session now.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.Nicole GerminoThis is Nicole on for Robyn. So just a quick question for us. Can you share what you expect the shared decision making to slow the uptake in the U.S. would be in? What we want to know if they can elaborate -- if you guys can elaborate on why you think this is the case and with peak annual sales is lower than previously expected? And how do you think ex-U.S. sales might be impacted if at all, give the ACIP decision?Albert BourlaThank you. Maybe Angela can answer that. The question was, do you expect respiratory disease season to have a big impact on RSV, and also do we expect -- in the U.S. and also do we expect any impact, excluding the U.S.?Angela HwangSure. So first of all, we're really excited about the approval for our RSV older adult vaccine. And the way I would see the shared clinical decision-making is just that it is a step towards the full routine recommendation that we anticipate. So I think that there is -- the way to look at it is that it's a short-term effect. We do expect that with more data that will emerge -- be emerging out of our clinical program, that we'll have an additional opportunity to go back to the ACIP and actually get the routine recommendation that we hope for. So over the next year or so, as we collect and finalize our data, that is really the anticipation of it. So it doesn't change the full opportunity for this particular vaccine. It doesn't change the peak. It just means that it takes us a little bit longer to get to the peak because of the shared clinical decision-making that was -- that extra step that we have to take right now.Albert BourlaAnd what about the ex-U.S.?Angela HwangEx-U.S., actually, we had a different filing. We were able to get both maternal and older adult at the same time, so I think you see slightly different dynamics there in that here in the U.S., our maternal vaccine will be launching later. But in ex-U.S. they'll be -- and in Europe, they will be launching at the same time. And those vaccine technical committees have not opined yet on those recommendations, in particular in terms of the utilization. And so we'll await that. But I think what you have that's different and that's really a great upside is the fact that we have both indications at once.Albert BourlaThank you very much, Angela. I hope we gave you what you asked, Robyn. Operator, the next question please.OperatorNext, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore.Umer RaffatI know I heard 2 different things on the cost cut just now. One was that it would be enterprise-wide, while Albert, I think, used the word within the COVID cost base. So I was just trying to reconcile the 2. And also on danuglipron, is it reasonable to expect that if it's below mid-teens weight loss, you wouldn't move forward?Albert BourlaLet me clarify. Of course, it will be enterprise-wide, but what I said is that the COVID part is going to be the biggest one. Right now, you need to know that R&amp;D and SI&amp;A cost of COVID is big, it's not a small amount. So it's -- there's a lot of events. Mikael, can you speak a little bit about the prospects to move ahead danu?Mikael DolstenWell, we really look forward to get the data. And as you know, we have in parallel developed activities also for modified leads. I think we really need to look at the totality of data, its performance on important metabolic permit in diabetes, its ability to deliver weight loss as you alluded to, and also, of course, its tolerability in general. These 3 complicate how well the drug can perform. And I remain optimistic that oral drugs in this class can have a profound effect on weight loss. Of course, one needs to be maybe a little bit cautioned to drive weight loss too far, as you have seen also some concerns in public media about side effects that may arise on that. So we will really integrate all of that data and make a decision, and we really look forward to that moment.OperatorOur next question will come from Evan Seigerman with BMO.Evan David SeigermanKind of a follow-up from Umer's, I want to focus on the GLP-1 franchise. Can you talk about the competitive profile of danuglipron in its current form, considering safety, twice-daily dosing and efficacy? And maybe remind us on the timelines to potentially get more on a once-daily formulation of this asset?Albert BourlaMikael?Mikael DolstenYes. As I said in my prepared remarks, we expect data at the later part of this year. We are absolutely encouraged and confident that it has a different profile when it comes to adverse events as the drug lotiglipron that we stopped. So we don't see that as an issue. And I also spoke to that we will put together the totality of data to -- pending readout, prepare a potential Phase III program. And it's a very big sector, diabetes and obesity. We have considerable expertise in treating cardiometabolic patients. So we look forward to share more data and more plans with you as we move through the quarter. Thank you for your great interest. It is important to us.OperatorNext, we have Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.Terence C. FlynnMaybe 2 for me. Dave, I was just wondering how we should think about steady-state operating margin here. Looking back pre-COVID, the company was around mid- to high 30% range. So is that how we should think about this when you gave us some of the parameters, but just maybe how to think about steady state?And then on the messenger RNA Phase III seasonal flu vaccine program, it looks like that trial was upsized based on clinicaltrials.gov. So just wondering, Mikael, if you can talk through timing of data and help frame expectations there.Albert BourlaThank you, Terence. Let's start with Dave.David M. DentonYes, so great question. As we think about our operating margin long term, clearly, our objective is to expand that over time. Clearly, it is our expectation to get back to, at a minimum, pre-COVID levels with one caveat is that we -- as we go forward, we do have a different mix of products within our portfolio, particularly the vaccine related to COVID. As you know, the vaccine, given the cost share that we have or profit share that we have with our partner, does dilute that product from an operating margin perspective. So with mix adjusted, you should see us back to those levels over time. But obviously, as we cycle into '24, we'll give you a lot more clarity on all the puts and takes as we integrate Seagen, as we roll forward from a COVID franchise perspective, how that looks, as well as all the developments that we have coming out the pipeline at this point in time.Albert BourlaThank you, David. Mikael, mRNA, flu.Mikael DolstenYes. First, the totality of experience we have with mRNA for flu makes me very encouraged that this will be the new modality as it was for COVID but now for flu, that engages [through mechanism] the B cells and the T cell that we should aspire for, having better efficacy than what we have seen with the old flu. We are continuing with the study because we just wanted to have more events and particularly have addition of a flu V type of events, which were scarce in the newest part of the trial.And we look forward to update you, hopefully, be able to conclude the study later this year. But we also are putting mitigations as adding immunity studies that can be supplementary for getting a total good data package of activity against flu A and flu B. But as I said, I remain very optimistic that the mRNA is going to be the next important platform to deal with flu. Thank you.OperatorNext, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.Chris ShibutaniTwo questions, if I may. On the potential enterprise-wide cost program, you would have some opportunity outside of the COVID programs to consider? Can you help us with the relative weighting potentially of R&amp;D versus SG&amp;A or some other component of that? And I ask that in part because you've announced some changes, for instance, in kind of the structure at the top tier of management of the R&amp;D with the anticipation of the oncology and Seattle Genetics.And then secondly, if I could, on the Rocky Mount facility, it's reassuring to hear in terms of your own staff. But I think folks are looking to get a sense for the scale of the damage and perhaps what potential gating factors for getting more information on timing? I know that you guys have communicated with some of your hospital-based customers, but any additional insights in terms of magnitude, impact and timing of the recovery, and what that could look like from a progress standpoint would be helpful.Albert BourlaLet me say a few words about the Rocky Mount, and then I'll ask Dave to answer the question about the cost adjustment program in case we have a significant reduction on our revenues because of the COVID. The Rocky Mount, it was severe the damage of the hurricane, but the damage was mainly concentrated on the warehouse, which means that we lost a lot of inventory that was about to be sent to the market. The facilities per se, the production facilities were not impacted by the hurricanes, so the buildings are standing there. However, because the utilities were discontinued, the facilities had to stop operating. And in this highly sensitive sterile environment, when you are losing power, it's not easy to switch on and switch off. It takes time and a lot of processes so that we can start it.And the additional challenge will be some of the inventories of materials that were also destroyed, particularly glass and other startup, we need to make sure that we will replace in time. So what I want to say is that we feel very confident that the whole thing will go back to life. But still, we are assessing how long that will take. And we are doing anything we can to make sure that we will minimize the shortages in the marketplace because of that. Now let's move to some more color on the cost adjustment program.David M. DentonYes. So thank you for the question. Clearly, as we develop this program in the back half of '23, we look forward to sharing a lot more details as we cycle into '24 and give you a lot of, I'll say, milestones as you think about both our cost and investment structure going forward. Importantly, as you know, we're extremely excited about the Seagen acquisition that's upcoming here.Upon approval, this will allow the company to refocus its efforts and its investments to make sure that we're squarely focused on battling cancer going forward. And we think there's a big opportunity as we align our resources against that franchise and that battle to fight cancer, and an opportunity for patients and importantly, an opportunity long term for Pfizer.Having said that, we will be informed in the back half of the year of our revenue performance, specifically as it relates to COVID. That will inform us the level of opportunity we have to expand our margins into '24 and '25 and beyond. That will allow us to step back and make sure that all of our costs, all our investments are aligned with those Seagen objectives as well as aligned to maximizing the performance of our in-line portfolio as well as the launches that are occurring as we speak in the back half of this year.So again, we look forward to sharing a lot more to this -- from this. This will be balanced, as you well know between SI&amp;A and R&amp;D, and we'll give you that specific breakdown and that specific information later this year and into next year.OperatorNext, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.Louise Alesandra ChenWanted to ask you first on these COVID scenarios that you think could unfold in the second half '23. Any way you could share some of the big ones that you anticipate could potentially happen? And then secondly, seeing a lot of headlines in the ATTR-CM space. I'm just curious if you anticipate any potential competition or meaningful competition to VYNDAQEL, VYNDAMAX?Albert BourlaAll right. So on the COVID, I will say a few words and then I will ask Angela to comment on both. Look, the COVID scenarios, it depends. What are the uncertainties? I think I articulated. Let's start with the vaccine. The biggest uncertainty is vaccination rates. I think market share is pretty much, I think, well established. Vaccination rate is what we are going to see in the fall that is coming. So that will be a big concern.Another uncertainty was the time of commercialization in the U.S. because, of course, you go with new inventories, new sales to the market and with higher prices. That has been resolved. We know that it's very likely that we will launch in September because FDA and CDC they asked us to change the inventories basically by creating a new vaccine. So that will happen.And also, the other uncertainty that existed about the COVID vaccine was the European contract. That was a very long -- very big contract. And now we have ascertained that it has been negotiated, a little bit less for the year because it's spread over 4 years, but it's renegotiated. So all of that are the key uncertainty. Of course, there is how much LatAm, Latin America, and other countries, would prefer this. It's not the only ones, but we think those are the fundamentals.And we will know pretty much the trend in the third quarter. And we will know pretty much, quite accurate, what is the situation in the end of the year, that I think will be a very big predictor of what you should expect going forward with the only upside if we have a combined vaccine with flu or with RSV that, that will increase the vaccination rate.On PAXLOVID, a little bit more uncertainty because, of course, we are having the uncertainty of treatment rates and infection rates. And we don't know how that will behave. We don't have any benchmarks to see how that goes. We know that the treatment rates are following very closely the infection rates, and the infection rates are rising right now. But remains to be seen how that will work. Of course, also the same with PAXLOVID arising and receive the market, the scripts on a weekly basis as always do when the infection rates are going up.But we have some more uncertainties over there, which is the timing of launch, which will depend on how we will agree for the interest of public health to transition this launch with the various governments. So all of that remains to be seen. And these are the scenarios that we see for COVID. And the key message it is the uncertainty will go away at the end of the year. We will know what COVID will contribute on a stable basis in Pfizer's revenue and we will go from there. Now Angela, maybe if you want anything to add to that and talk about the next question -- the other question.Angela HwangLouise, I think when you talk about VYNDAMAX or VYNDAQEL, the biggest and our biggest differentiator that we're extremely confident about is just the totality of our data, really, along 4 dimensions. And whether that's clinical data or real-world data. We have all-cause mortality and CV-related hospitalization data. Our data also relevant in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR-CM, so that's unique.We've also demonstrated significant survival benefit at 5 years through our real-world data. So whichever way you look at it, and if you compare that with any competitor program, I think that we have a highly differentiated and an extremely valuable molecule that stacks up well against any competition.OperatorNext, we have Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.Mohit BansalAnd maybe a follow-up to this one a little bit. So thank you for all the transparency, by the way. So is it fair to say that in COVID trends that you have seen so far, at least sales trend that had been below your expectations, and you want to see 1 more quarter before you adjust expectations. I'm asking this because if I look at the -- it seems like you still expect 88 million or so vaccinations in the second half of the year in the U.S. and the number was actually, by our conversion, 44 million or so in terms of administration, 111 million in terms of shipments. So just trying to understand, is it like -- is it something where you are -- where we could get better update in third quarter on the COVID numbers?Albert BourlaYes. Thank you for the question. I think the answer is yes, we should get way better still. It's not that we just want to see another quarter. We want to see the big quarter of the respiratory season. COVID, we always said and everybody, I think, thinks that, that is a common sense. But we'll follow going forward the seasonality of the other respiratory vaccines. That's becoming more and more and more clear, right?And the majority of these vaccinations are happening in the third and fourth quarter for the year. So it's not that we are just another quarter. We're awaiting the main quarter. If COVID vaccinations go anywhere close to the flu vaccination rates, then we have a very big bit of what we expect to have. If they are a small fraction of what will happen for flu, then of course, we have a miss. So that's why we are going to see how that will evolve. So it's a very, very important quarter.The rest, although for the first half of the year, we have got significant contribution towards the total growth. So we don't need that much of inventory if we have the utilization over there to make sure that we know how big the COVID franchise will become. And as I said, in the EU, we have adjusted very well. We know we'll have high certainty. PAXLOVID because China is a very, very good market. We don't know how in the next wave the PAXLOVID will be used.We have the rest of the world, but the inventories, they were also last year. So we are now expecting that the products will start being going out or (inaudible) product will start more reordering from many more countries. So that's why the infection rates on the PAXLOVID will be extremely, extremely important. And all of that are happening now. So once we know them, we can predict way more accurately. Thank you very much.OperatorNext, we have Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse.Trung Chuong HuynhYou commented the long-term outlook for your non-COVID business remains intact relative to the 2030 ambitions. How are you thinking about the midterm 2025 guide because if you assume the midpoint of your ex-COVID '23 guide at 7%, in order to achieve the 6% 2020 to 2025 guidance ex-COVID, on our calculations, you need to do high single-digit growth for that base business for '24 and '25. That looks tough especially as you'll have more LOEs. So do you remain confident in that midterm guide?Albert BourlaYes, thank you. The LOEs are coming basically from year '26, right? So all the way to '25, I think the impact will not be that high. Also, the guidance that we gave was 6%, if I'm -- yes, we feel quite confident that we will be there. So we'll continue and we are at 6% right now all these years, right, year-to-date. So yes, the non-COVID business, I think clearly, the success of the launches is very important. So we'll see a lot of things coming ahead of us. But it is way better predictable. And I think we are there, so I don't think there will be any variability. Thank you for the question, by the way.OperatorNext, we have Colin Bristow with UBS.Colin Nigel BristowAnother follow-up on danuglipron. I just didn't have the answer in terms of when we'll hear about the once-daily formulation. And I'd just like to understand your level of confidence here that you can make this a once-daily formulation without negatively impacting the AE profile, presumably given an increase in Cmax.And then more broadly, can you just talk more about how you're going to compete here, given I think it was previously referenced you're behind the competition, the clinical differentiation, the potentially less convenient dosing and essentially a therapeutic category in which you don't have a major presence. And then just maybe one other quick one on a pipeline item, on DMD gene therapy. It's a late-stage asset that doesn't seem to get much airtime. Is your enthusiasm waning on this program? Or is it just that others are sort of a bigger priority?Albert BourlaYes, thank you. So Mikael, again, clearly the obesity market and the size of it is creating a lot of interest in danuglipron and -- so the question was about the 1-day formulation. And then also tell us a little bit about where we are with DMD.Mikael DolstenI hear your interest in a once-daily product, and I would say I don't see any particular barrier for us in creating that. We have tremendous experience in modified release formulation. And our early data, as we now have initiated a while ago, tells us we should be encouraged that when it relates to once-a-day modified release for danuglipron, I believe we will have such a formulation in a reasonable future in our hands.When could it come to the market if the drug continues and makes a great Phase III? Well, I think we can have it at launch or shortly after launch. So I wouldn't worry about that. But I agree with you that once-daily modified release can sometimes actually improve the tolerability profile by (inaudible) and the variability and exposure, which typically reduce GI side effects that have been seen as limiting this drug. So that's why I can see a potential twofold advantage of an MR goes from twice a day to once a day, and may also help uniquely to create a tolerability profile within the structures of oral GLPs.(inaudible) I'm encouraged that the FDA took a very positive angle on that drug when it comes to its urgency to get into the market. Chris, you and I have worked very closely on that, and we expect today relatively soon to conclude the trial. I'll also ask Chris to pitch in on it.Chris BoshoffThank you, Mikael. So the DMD program is obviously very important for us not just for the importance of gene therapy but for patients and families with this absolutely devastating disease. And we do have an interim analysis later this year for the CIFFREO trial. The CIFFREO trial, all patients have now been enrolled in the study. The interim analysis will be based not on a surrogate biomarker end point but on truly functional end point. So we believe that's the best way to measure the benefit of gene therapy in this disease is with a functional end point. And that should come later this year, and we'll update you with the final analysis for the study then in 2024.Albert BourlaThat was terrific. I just wanted to add that we have, like you heard Sarepta [enroll] biomarker data that look very robust in our hand. But as Chris said, we want to provide patients with even more experience about the potential benefit.OperatorNext, we have Kerry Holford with Berenberg.Kerry Ann HolfordA couple of questions (inaudible). It's clear that demand for your COVID assets will influence whether or not you go down this rig. But given the potential you've highlighted previously for a COVID-flu combination vaccine, I'm interested to understand whether the upcoming Phase III data from your mRNA flu vaccine trial will influence your decisions on that cost saving program in any way.And then secondly, on hemophilia, your anti-TFPI say you're filing second half of this year for noninhibitor patients. Should we assume you would seek to launch in that patient group only next year? Or would you wait for the detail in the inhibitor patient group before you proceed to market? And perhaps you can just discuss how big an opportunity you see in that drug.Albert BourlaLet me start with the COVID and then Mikael also can comment. But for example, we are very excited about the combinations, right? And the combinations will be flu and COVID and then also flu, COVID and RSV. And we are working on that. And we believe actually that the fact that if we have a combination with the non-mRNA included although that we have likely that we expect to have the benefit of better safety profile because we don't have to load 3 product's RNA into a single injection, but we will be using only 2, COVID and flu, and then we'll use the protein-based vaccine (inaudible). All of that are working very well.Now the question is what will happen if the COVID market is seen to be very -- is monovalent. It's very, very low. I think that will play here in our decision about controlling the cost because if it is very, very low, although we expect an upside in the combination, we will assume at this stage that the medical need for COVID is not that high. And as a result, we will reduce our investments in the area and also temper our expectations for sales. And then if the combinations come and we are way more successful, then we restore. You want also -- what was your second question? Yes, about the marstacimab. Mikael?Mikael DolstenI'm very excited about marstacimab. I follow this project for a long time. And as you know, we reported out a very encouraging data. We had 92% reduction in annual bleeding rate versus on-demand. We had really no safety events that has been associated with other products, including Hemlibra. It's active against both A and B. It's administrated with a prefilled pen. I think it can be, from a medical point of view, a very large product, a single option for hemophilia A and B. Of course, when I think about how Hemlibra has been such a promise for heme A patient and I see this profile that looks so good, I'm optimistic that it can do well in both segments.Albert BourlaThank you very much. Let's move to the next question, please. And we are a little bit -- the time is flying. So a lot of interest. So let's try to be more -- one question, please.OperatorOur next question will come from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.Geoffrey Christopher MeachamJust had 2 real quick ones. Angela, on Prevnar, what does long-term growth look like? Clearly, you may have a tougher competitive environment. Just if you lose share, what do you think the [TAM growth] could look like to offset that? And then Mikael, you talked a little bit about next-gen CDK. I know it's super early in development. But is there a risk-benefit hurdle you have in line? I'm just thinking about cost benefit post-IBRANCE LOE and also considering the competitive landscape.Albert BourlaSo Angela, how concerned you are with the competitive environment, with respect to our competitors, but we have some realities that maybe you want to discuss. And also, I will ask -- actually, it will be Chris Boshoff to answer the question of CDK4 since we have him here in his new capacity. Angela?Angela HwangWell, I mean, I want to begin by just saying how I'm incredibly proud we are of the performance of the entire Prevnar franchise. If you look at the adult indication, we have grown -- not only have we grown 23% since last year this time, we are doing all of this growth prior to the full vaccination season, which is what you typically see. So the fact that we've been able to bring these vaccinations tell us a lot about the work that we've done in pneumococcal disease, how well appreciated it is, but also how well our machinery is working, not to mention the fact that we have 96% share of the adult indication.In peds also, of course, being that we went from being 100% of the market, today, we share some of that market share with PCV15. But I just want to remind everyone that, that is to be expected, and we are exactly where we thought we would be. And so from that perspective, we're also really proud of how Prevnar 13 has competed with Prevnar -- PCV15. I think the important thing here to realize is that given the ACIP recommendation that we've just got for Prevnar peds, what we are beginning to see now is a sort of reversal of that decline and the reclaiming of market share.And so we have -- the fact that we've seen some accounts purchasing PCV20 peds now, we've seen some account switching from PCV15 to our own Prevnar 20, the fact that our federal contracts had added Prevnar 20 to their register, which means that public vaccinations can begin. And then maybe the one thing I will mention about Prevnar peds which is unique compared to any other pneumococcal vaccine, which is that we were given the recommendation to vaccinate adult -- well, kids 2 to 18 immunocompromised. So that is a whole new population that we've never had before.So when you kind of bring all of this together and you factor that this quarter alone, Prevnar franchise generated $1.3 billion in revenue, just this 1 quarter, I think that order of magnitude gives you a sense of the scale and the competitiveness of our portfolio, and we're really excited about what Prevnar can do over the next coming quarters.Albert BourlaAnd that is under the competition of PCV15 which I think was around $150 million, if I'm not mistaken. Chris, can you please speak about the CDK4 and the franchise in general over there?Chris BoshoffThank you for the question. So as you know, ER+ breast cancer is the most common cancer globally for women, and we're very proud that we can build on our leadership in cell cycle inhibition with IBRANCE. And with 3 first-in-class potential assets, CDK4-specific inhibitor, CDK2-specific inhibitor and a KAT6-specific inhibitor, all 3 with significant potential to transform treatment in the future for ER+ breast cancer.For CDK4, we have seen more complete and continuous CDK4 target coverage and potentially improved tolerability due to reduced CDK6 inhibition. And as Mikael has pointed out, CDK6 leads to the hematological vulnerability. We know that epithelial cells specifically, highly expressed CDK4, and that's why it's so important to specifically target CDK4. And what we've seen, as Mikael has pointed out, is grade 3 neutropenia of 15% with our CDK4 inhibitor and that's versus 60% as expected with other CDK4/6 inhibitors.We've also not noted any grade 3 diarrhea. And again, that's very different from what you know from some of the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. We're accelerating our registration strategy with the first study in second-line post CDK4/6, where we've recently shown 30% overall response rate in a heavy pretreated population, and we're also starting populations with CDK4 plus CDK2 as well as CDK4 with our potential next-generation backbone, ARV-471 or vepdegestrant, which we are codeveloping with Arvinas.OperatorNext, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.Timothy Minton AndersonIf I could go back to the COVID guidance. Investors have been cautious not only on the level of your prior guidance for '23 but also the shape of the future revenue curves beyond '23. So my question is on the latter, let's say, for the future curve. Are you confident still in saying that 2023 should be the trough, and then you'll rebound to some higher level of sales in 2024 and beyond and see kind of continued growth from that point forward? Or is that now more uncertain, too?Albert BourlaYes. Thank you. Yes, I think that this year's utilization at the marketplace will form the basis that we can predict reliably for the next years. I don't think it will be any much different because there will be no different catalyst in the marketplace. Vaccination rates would settle and then the treatment and infection rates also will be, after a new year, indicative of what we should expect periodically.Clearly, we will have to deal with some inventories movements and this year was a transitioning year because we are going to give prices, and we are going to absorb some of inventories, et cetera. So that should inform the accurate number for '24 and beyond, but should be the base and likely should be higher than what we should see this year. But that, provided that we have reasonable vaccination and treatment range of PAXLOVID. So that's why I say that let's wait to see what will be the actual in this year. And particularly, what will be the utilization, as I said. Because next year, all these inventories and price adjustment things will be very clear what it will be. So thank you very much for the question.OperatorOur next question will come from Carter Gould with Barclays.Carter Lewis GouldThanks for all the transparency on your thought process on the COVID side. Plenty great questions asked this morning. I guess one I wanted to -- didn't get addressed is you out-licensed your TL1A late last year. Your partner, then turns around and sells it for quite substantially more. I guess -- so to be a bit provocative, Albert, were Pfizer shareholders well served by this course of events? I would love to give you the opportunity to address that publicly.Albert BourlaThank you, Carter, for giving us this opportunity. And also thank you for recognizing with Roivant. So I think that's very important thought, particularly when there's uncertainty. We should all know what the scenarios and the parameters are and what the actions that could be potentially triggered with different scenarios. Now let's go to TL1A and let's see what is the situation. Aamir, have we served the shareholders to the best of our knowledge or not?Aamir MalikThanks for the question, Carter. And obviously I'm not going to comment on the rumors and speculation or the potential prices attached to different transactions. What I will say is we're very pleased with our TL1A Telavant partnership with Roivant. And we do think shareholders were well served. So as a reminder, why we entered this. We entered this as an R&amp;D portfolio prioritization decision.So from time to time, we make decisions as part of our disciplined process to our partner R&amp;D programs, where we think it is better to share the risk or the cost with a partner. And in this case, Telavant, covers all of the R&amp;D costs going forward. And that frees up significant R&amp;D capacity for Pfizer to invest in high priority programs. But we still retain value in this program in 3 different ways. We had a 25% equity stake in Telavant, we have full ex-U.S. and ex-Japan rights and we earned royalties on the U.S. and Japan sales. So taken together, this collaboration allows us to keep more than 50% of the total value of TL1A with 0 incremental R&amp;D spend. And for a Phase II program, we feel this is a very sound move for Pfizer shareholders.Albert BourlaYes. Mikael, anything to add here?Mikael DolstenAamir said it so well. I just wanted to punctuate among the very many options, we have strong platform in bispecific in many therapeutic areas, including immunology and we do have TL1A (inaudible) antibody. That would be very interesting, where we own even greater shares. We have triple specifics that are going into atopic dermatitis. So this just punctuates it. Even in the very same therapeutic area, we have so many things going on. And near term, we expect soon approval for etrasimod and another readout that would go on. So a lot to start there.Albert BourlaThank you. Thank you, Mikael. Don't think competition too much about what we have in our pocket.OperatorNext, we have Steve Scala with Cowen.Stephen Michael ScalaI just have an observation than a question, but the observation is that it's still not clear what has changed in your long-term COVID expectations versus when you first gave the $30-billion guidance 6 months ago, since in the prior 6 months, nothing really has changed other than FDA action, which doesn't impact the long term. So that's just an observation.But my question is on VYNDAQEL. VYNDAQEL has become a very important franchise, yet its exclusivity is not long in either the U.S. or the EU. Are there any strategies to get around the LOEs? Or is it simply similar to Eliquis where post LOEs, Pfizer will move on to other products?Albert BourlaYes. So why don't you take the question, Angela?Angela HwangYes. Well, it is, as you say, an incredibly important product, and we're just so proud of the fact that it's still growing 40-something percent this quarter. I think when it comes to LOEs, just from the perspective of how we needed, our composition of matter patent expires in 2024, but we have patent term extensions that get us through December of 2028. In the EU, it's 2026. In Japan, it goes right up to 2029.So actually, I feel like we still have a good runway as it pertains to this product, more diagnoses that we need to do and more patients that we can capture on to VYNDAQEL, especially with the incredibly competitive and differentiated profile that we have. As you say, we're always, and working with Aamir, looking at opportunities as to what might be good fit into -- what might fit well into this franchise, in this portfolio. But I guess from my perspective, with or without it, we see an incredibly strong opportunity for us to continue to capture growth.OperatorNext question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners.David Reed RisingerSo my question is on Pfizer's mRNA flu vaccine candidate, please. And Sanofi had stated at its recent Vaccines Analyst Day that first-generation mRNAs against flu will not deliver sufficient strain B efficacy given mRNA technical issues in targeting strain B. So could you just comment on that and your expectations for your vaccines' southern hemisphere strain B efficacy results later this year?I know that there wasn't the emergence of strain B in the northern hemisphere, but I'm curious about your expectations for demonstrating that strain B efficacy in the southern hemisphere. And then in addition, if you could just comment on your expected reactogenicity profile for mRNA flu versus COMIRNATY's reactogenicity profile?Albert BourlaThank you very much, David. Very good questions. Mikael, so our -- the technical issues that Sanofi is having, are we experiencing as well?Mikael DolstenWell, I think the difference between maybe the pioneering mRNA compound is Pfizer and of course there is Moderna that have worked on this technology many years. We have ourselves in 5 years into it and make ample improvement across the entire mRNA chain. And I think it just gives us a big leg up and world experience we had with COVID vaccine. So I can't really comment on the issues that Sanofi are facing. I share a much more positive -- I have a much more positive outlook that we have in our capability to design mRNA vaccines that will be powerful against flu A and also against flu B. And let's wait. Let's -- we accumulate data and see the outcome, but I'm optimistic about that and realize it's a field that requires a lot of capability [vendor] with moderate reactogenicity. The flu reactogenicity has actually been moderate, been really good. So that's not an issue at all at end of the doses that we have been testing in young or older patients.Albert BourlaThank you for clarifying, Mikael.OperatorNext, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.Andrew Simon BaumCould you talk about the impact of price negotiation under the IRA? Expressly, could you talk to whether you'll be able to collapse the rebate to PBMs in order to offset the impact of, let's say, Eliquis' price reduction, following the price negotiations and therefore, protect your earnings? Or do you think you'll have to still pay the PBMs that kind of a flash even though they're being able to buy the drug at a much reduced price -- or fund the drug at a much reduced price?And then separately for Mikael, given the recent acquisition of Seagen, to what extent -- or planned acquisition of Seagen, to what extent do you believe that there is a potential to review your existing pipeline in order to make room or further optimize your R&amp;D spend to put behind Seagen's additional assets?Albert BourlaYes. So why don't we go first to answer about what IRA will mean in terms of changing the rebates, et cetera, which it's quite a new situation. So we have to see how it plays. But if you want to speak a little bit about it, Angela?Angela HwangYes, sure. So that's exactly right, Albert. I think there's just -- it's a new policy and lots to understand in terms of how it's going to play out. As you say, there will be price negotiations, but at the same time, I think that what we also have to remember, Andrew, is that there's a mitigating factor of the fact that more patients likely will be able to get on Eliquis because of the co-pay threshold and that sort of cap we're going to have as a function of IRA.And so I think it's a dynamic situation. There's lots for us to consider as it pertains to pricing, rebates, but also patient utilization of the drug and all of this will play out. I guess, as it pertains specifically also to Eliquis, just to remind everyone that though it's obviously one of our largest drugs, its LOE will be around that '26 timeframe. So whatever the impact is, will not be long lasting on our portfolio because it's losing patent anyway around that time.Albert BourlaThank you very much, Angela. It's an evolving environment so we need to really go see it. Also, Andrew, very quickly on the pipeline issue. We have made very clear, but the Seagen acquisition will mean nothing to the pipeline assets. So no pipeline assets will be eliminated or reduced or increased as a result of -- actually, would be increased because of the combinations, but will not be any reductions on pipeline assets as a result of this acquisition.OperatorNext, we have Chris Schott with JPMorgan.Christopher Thomas SchottJust a 2-parter on COMIRNATY. Can you just help me a little bit in terms of -- I guess with the updated vaccine being commercialized in September, how much of your remaining COVID revenue should we think about in 3Q versus 4Q? And I'm just trying to get my sense of when we get this 3Q update, will that be based on the sales we're seeing in the quarter? Or more your interpretation of the trend we're seeing for vaccinations? So just setting expectations. And the second part was on the EU contract renegotiation. Just any additional color you can provide on how different, I guess, the terms end up being for 2023 relative to what was reflected in the 2023 guidance?Albert BourlaThank you very much. I can take it very quickly. Look, if you see, we will have basically July, August, September in the third quarter. So the vaccinations, with the new, would start in September, hopefully, of course. What we expect is that we will have approval by the end of August. And we are ready with products already now. So we have -- so the production will not be an issue.So normally, we should have also in Q3, most of it in Q4. But what really will clarify us at the end of Q3 plus also the month that takes after Q3 until we give -- we present our Q3 results, it is really the vaccination rates, right? That is what will inform. And then price, right? Because everything after all, way better working at price. So very big part of this uncertainty for COMIRNATY will go away.On the EU contract renegotiation, I don't know if you noticed, I did say that when we gave our guidance, we were expecting that we will have incorporated assumptions, that we will renegotiate the new contract and our assumptions, we're assuming that we will do over 3 years. Now we did over 4 years, which that creates pressure to our guidance, but then we had some contracts that we didn't expect guidance in Latin America, particularly, that offset very big part of that. So that's why there's no -- but by itself, it's not a reason to change the guidance one way or another. Really, as I said, vaccination rates, it is what will define what is the potential of this vaccines for the years to come. Thank you very much, Chris.OperatorNext, we have Rajesh Kumar with HSBC.Rajesh KumarJust one for me. You're doing a lot of acquisitions. You've done a large one, Seagen, recently. It's not completed, but as we look forward, how do you think the -- what are the sort of integration challenges you see both on the execution, commercial side but also on the scientific side? What are the things that get you excited versus worried?Albert BourlaFor the Seagen acquisition, right? Let me...Rajesh KumarBut you had multiple acquisitions before that as well. So just -- you've got multi-integrations going on sort of, that's why I'm asking the question.Albert BourlaExactly. Exactly. Yes. So let me start with what excites us with Seagen and I think it's the science behind this company. The ADCs are playing a key role right now, more and more in our research and in our fight against cancer. And Seagen has 1 of the 2 leading platforms and we believe it's actually a better one. So I think that excites me a lot.Also what excites me a lot is that Seagen was able to achieve all this greatness with limited results, relatively compared to what we are bringing on the table. And what we are bringing on the table on the results front, of course, is not only the capital but also a significant expertise on designing the molecules. And particularly in the small molecules, we are very, very, very good. So when it speaks about payloads, I think we can contribute significantly into that.Secondly, we are thinking that there is such a nice way of being able to commercialize those products of Seagen, but already in the market or will come because as we look at global presence, that Seagen is lagging. And also in the U.S., we will almost triple our resources once the whole thing is integrated. So there is a lot of things to be excited.Now as you rightly pointed out, things happening, integrations, that we need to be very aware. And not only we -- we do have our fair share of things that we did wrong in the past and we have our fair share of things that we did right in the past. So I know what is extremely, extremely important is to make sure that, first of all, there will be no cultural clash as we are putting together the 2 organizations. To that end, we are very, very lucky because oncology companies tend to have very, very similar (inaudible), the oncology companies. And that was saying that even the chemistry of our scientists compared to Seagen's scientists. Actually, where it is really evident it is how many of the great scientists of Seagen raise their hand to join Chris' leadership team as we are going forward. And those scientists will have published this information who will be coming from Seagen. Actually, many of them will lead the global oncology business, not only our past acquisition, not only the Pfizer one, but they will lead the global -- not only the Seagen one, but the global, which is Seagen plus core.The second thing that we need to be very careful it is that we don't slow down things, and we don't increase cost of things. This is something that we have seen when big companies are acquiring small. But many times, cost goes double and the timelines goes also doubled. So that's something that we must avoid. And in order to avoid, we are doing tremendous pre-integration planning to make sure that innovation will be enhanced dramatically after we are putting the 2 together. And I have full trust on, of course, Chris, that is leading this integration, on this planning for months now. And last but not least, many times, when you have an integration, it could go wrong and it's good if a CEO, which is the one who can resolve conflicts in a corporation and make decisions fast, has very high visibility on what is happening. So I think very fast. This is our biggest investment for many decades. That's clearly the biggest investment under my watch. And we take it very seriously as one of the most potential exciting opportunities to grow. But also, we are very cognizant that we should make sure that nothing goes wrong. So I'm personally on it. And Seagen is going to be one of our biggest bets as you can see going forward. So we are using all our experience and the best people and I'm very, very pleased. And I'm very, very pleased because chemistry of the 2 teams is unbeatable right now. And they are working like one and they are all coming to see the new Seagen/Pfizer oncology portfolio growing faster than when we were alone.OperatorOur last question will come from Michelle Rivera with inThought Research.Michelle RiveraWhat's the status of the DMD gene therapy program? Have you finalized dosing patients? I read a statement at a recent conference that you finalized screening patients. So I was not sure whether that meant that the trial had been paused. Just some clarity around that and when we should expect data, would be helpful.Albert BourlaChris, you were running DMD until recently. Now, you, of course, provided Mikael the responsibility. So can you give us a little bit very quickly what is the status of DMD?Chris BoshoffYes, thank you. So the -- as I mentioned earlier, the clinical trial has now completed enrollment. As you pointed out, the halt dosing for the last couple of patients due to a protocol amendment, but we're very confident that we will go ahead and have the interim analysis later this year based on the functional end point, which will be substituted also or which will be, yes, with the biomarker data. We'll have both functional data as well as biomarker data later this year, and then the final analysis for the full study in 2024. We've also fully enrolled now the earlier age group, patients between the ages of 2 and 3 years old, 10 patients enrolled in that trial. So yes, we're looking forward to share the data later this year for you.Albert BourlaThank you very much. In summary, I think we had a solid quarter, continue to invest, to support our unprecedented 19 potential launches in an 18-month period. These are doing very well. The plan is executed as per the timelines. In our pipeline and in value-creating revenue-generating business development opportunities like Seagen, which, as I articulated just in the question before that, it is clearly our big bet and our very, very big opportunity moving forward.Over the next 3 months, we look forward to moving beyond the current uncertainty related to our COVID-19-related revenue. So we have better clarity. And by the end of the year, we'll have -- the uncertainty will be removed almost at last. To that extent that any adjustments are needed into our cost base for '24 and beyond, we are ready to make. I want to reemphasize that the biggest uncertainty in terms of the long term is vaccination rate. Some short term uncertainties like when commercialization will be, I think it's just a question of time. But the vaccination and treatment rates that we are going to see, I think, will inform what we should expect for the years to come, with only upside with the combination vaccines.Putting all these factors together, we remain confident in our ability to deliver a robust operational growth and deliver meaningful shareholder value through the end of the decade and beyond.And that, we will bring our call to a close. Thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your day.OperatorThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Pfizer's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.]"

Non-COVID segments saw 5% growth, but that isn't enough for the company to maintain a strong 2023 outlook.The company reduced the upper end of its guidance by $1 billion, for a new range of $67 billion to $70 billion for 2023, and reduced from 7%-9% growth (non-COVID) to 6%-8%.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla acknowledged the uncertainty of waning demand for COVID products but said it wouldn't last.""We are all almost in agreement that the uncertainty of COVID — which is there and it is real and it is quite significant — will disappear by the end of the year,"" he told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday.""Whatever will be the vaccination rates this fall ... and whatever will be the treatment and infection rates for COVID this fall, there is no reason to think that that will not be repeated in the years to come,"" Bourla added.""When we come to some certainty of what COVID will be ... even if it is very little, still remains a strong product in our pipeline,"" Bourla said.CFO David Denton said he knows analysts have been waiting to see how the company performs outside of the pandemic, which is why it didn't get a boost in recent years despite the COVID windfall.""Our cost structure and our investment focus will be aligned to the revenue going forward, so that people can get comfort that we have levers to pull financially so that we ... can make sure we deliver financially on our promise to investors,"" Denton said.Men walk by Pfizer headquarters, Friday, Feb. 5, 2021 in New York. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo)Beyond COVIDBeyond COVID, the company is working on building up its pipeline as it faces patent cliffs for some of its products. That is what drove its acquisition of Seagen (SGEN), which is still in the works awaiting Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance. Denton said once that deal closes it should also help with investor confidence.Story continuesPfizer has received six FDA approvals so far this year and expects another half dozen through the rest of the year.One of those approved is its RSV vaccine for adults ages 60 and older, the demand for which will be tested in the upcoming cold and flu season.That, in addition to mixed revenue on some of Pfizer's top products, is why JPM analysts called Tuesday's report ""mixed.""""Overall, we view today’s update as a mixed one for (Pfizer). On one hand, new product guidance is coming in below expectations for 2023, and (Pfizer) is acknowledging a highly uncertain COVID outlook. On the other, the company appears willing to adjust its cost base to better match its revenue output in the event COVID sales do not live up to expectations,"" the firm said in a note to clients.Medicare drug negotiationsPfizer's focus on its pipeline comes at a time when the industry is awaiting a list of target drugs that Medicare will negotiate prices for as part of its new powers under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).Big pharma firms like Merck (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) have independently sued the US Health Department, calling the law unconstitutional. They claim the law is an unfair way for the government to set prices. In addition to the companies, the US Chamber of Commerce and lobbying firm PhRMA have also filed separate suits.Pfizer has not filed on its own but is a member of some of the other organizations. Bourla said he agrees with the other companies that the law is going to hurt innovation — a common refrain among critics.""They will hurt innovation and they are already having a damaging impact on some of the decisions companies are making,"" Bourla said. ""It's going to kill a lot of small biotech companies,"" he added.While Pfizer hasn't filed a suit independently, the option is still on the table.""We retain all our rights to do what we think is appropriate,"" Bourla said.Follow Anjalee Khemlani on Twitter @AnjKhem.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PayPal is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PYPL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.17 per share for PYPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PYPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.12% heading into earnings season.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Musk previously co-founded X.com, a precursor to PayPal, reflecting his longstanding interest in online banking. Daniel Wolfe, American Banker Content Director for credit unions and payments, joins Yahoo Finance Live to shed light on Musk's history with the 'X' brand. Wolfe highlights, ""no financial services company likes being just one thing"" indicating that Musk's current plans are a more robust continuation of his vision for the online payments industry.Video Transcript- Elon Musk's decision to rebrand Twitter as X was a surprise to many who don't know the backstory. But before there were Tesla or SpaceX, Musk co-founded an online bank called X.com. For more on this, we turn to Daniel Wolfe, American Banker content director payments and credit unions. And that of course then was sort of the precursor to PayPal and the so-called PayPal Mafia, which included Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and some other folks who have been yeah, over there in Silicon Valley for a long time.So what can we sort of learn from X.com and the legacy of that and what it could mean for what he's now attempting?DANIEL WOLFE: So what it demonstrates is there is this legacy with Elon Musk, where he has this history of creating this internet bank. And this was created at a time when there was a void to fill, where banks were having trouble figuring out, how do we get people to use our services to pay for things online? And X.com and eventually PayPal filled that void and was even able to muscle out what the banks were doing certainly on eBay and there as well.And when they rebranded as PayPal, they kept the X.com name. And for a number of years, if you typed in X.com into your web browser, you would just go straight to PayPal. So they kept that, and they tried to capitalize it on it once again later on under eBay as X.commerce, a way to bring in developers to build things on top of PayPal, on top of eBay. And ultimately, PayPal spun off and the brand name went back to Elon Musk.Story continues- And so all of this considered, I mean, how does this set up for what they want to create in a Super app and even kind of leveraging that Super app as a play for financial service as well?DANIEL WOLFE: So if you look at the evolution of X.com and PayPal, it's no financial services company ever likes being just one thing because then, they risk becoming the dumb pipe that other people build things on top of. They want to be involved in that. They want to be enablers. And so you saw PayPal do that when it went off eBay to be in stores and to add services like PayPal pay later, Venmo, which they bought through acquisition, and so on and so forth.So with X.com, it kind of signals that this is going to be more than just OK, I see something on Twitter, I want to buy it. The problem is Twitter has already tried something like that before. They've tried things like turning their platform into a platform for commerce. So people advertise things on Twitter all the time. They advertise themselves, they advertise their work. And if you want to actually pay them for something, you click a link, you go to their website, their Patreon, what have you. You don't necessarily type your payment credentials into twitter.com or X.com now.So they've tried that, and it hasn't really turned Twitter into this everything app that Elon Musk wants to try it with. But he did build that foundation for PayPal. Now, PayPal still exists, so he's got to contend with that as his past success is now potentially his competitor. But it demonstrates kind of what Twitter has wanted and what he brings to that as well.- Well, and the other side of it is it's not a nascent technology anymore. There's not just PayPal and Venmo, there's Square, there's Zelle, there's lots of other ways. There's Shopify that is sort of facilitating payments for e-commerce also. So it seems like it's a much bigger lift now than it would have been then because now, it's just another one instead of the first mover, right?DANIEL WOLFE: Exactly. And it's as I said before, when X.com started, it was filling a void. Banks weren't able to enable a payment. And when we look at it now and today and what they're trying to accomplish, they need to solve a different problem. So what does Twitter or X.com bring to that equation? Well, it brings audience.I want to look at the Apple Card for example. Whether or not you use an Apple Card, if you're a college student and you want your first credit card-- when I was in college, if I needed a first credit card, I would walk around campus, somebody would offer me a free t-shirt, maybe a king-sized Snickers bar, and I would hand over all my personal information and I had a credit card. But now, you don't do that anymore. They can't.So if I need my first credit card, maybe it's in an app I already use. Whether it's the wallet app for Apple Card or Twitter or Uber or what have you. You see in Singapore, GrabPay for example, is built on the Grab ridesharing app. You have WeChat Pay built on WeChat. So if he has the audience and he can hold on to a significant number of people who are willing to put more of their lives into Twitter/X, then that's something that can be built upon.- It also strikes me as a big if though because you look at the much more dominant social platforms. I think of Meta, it would be very logical for Meta to do something like this. They already do a lot of commerce on things like Facebook Marketplace and on Instagram, for example. But there's no intrinsic payment system there, which maybe I'm extrapolating that that means it's hard because I haven't done that.DANIEL WOLFE: It is, Meta tried.- I don't know. Right, Meta tried and it didn't really-- what Libra wasn't--DANIEL WOLFE: Libra/DM, yeah. They tried to have a cryptocurrency. They also pitched themselves as a marketplace, kind of like eBay. Since they had the ability to take payments from advertisers, they wanted to build on that. And then when they launched Libra/DM, they had the buy in of major card networks, banks, other players in the financial system. They had all their ducks in a row, but they found that people just didn't want to use-- they were skeptical of Facebook. I mean, we all hear a conversation about people saying, oh, I was talking about a particular hat near my phone and then I saw an ad for it on Facebook or wherever. So there is an issue of trust. And Twitter no doubt has to confront those same issues.- I'm so glad you said that magic word, which is trust, because that's something that a University of Michigan Professor told us as well around this pivot, around this rebranding that Twitter has made and even the ambition that they have to have at X, excuse me, a super app. Because at the end of that is the data that somebody is going to have to give up.I'm sure you weren't able to stretch that Snickers bar the same way that a bank was able to stretch the data that you were surrendering to them. And so here, trust comes back into play and trust for Elon Musk as well as the combination of different experiences that he wants to bring together. And even if we could see-- and I guess the crux of the question here too, even in advance of that trust, you've got a person who's known as the dogefather who has been sending-- who's sent wild swings through cryptocurrency in the past, specifically Dogecoin. Could this be an app where they try to attempt to have a differentiating factor come through via crypto?DANIEL WOLFE: As you mentioned, Elon's-- and before I get into that, once I got the credit card, I was able to buy as many Snickers bars as I wanted.- OK, that's great.DANIEL WOLFE: I could stretch it.- A lifetime supply.DANIEL WOLFE: Oh, yeah. So yeah, there is his relationship with Dogecoin. If you look at his bio on X/Twitter right now, you will see the Dogecoin symbol as his location. So he's definitely still got that attachment to it and what you said with the valuation swings and so forth.And we've seen other payment companies actually make significant money by being a platform where you could buy and sell and trade crypto. Maybe not so much where you could spend it. But certainly his attachment to it and any affinity that people might have for Dogecoin, that could be something to capitalize on. But again, there's other companies that do that already. Turning it into something where you're willing to spend your Dogecoin or Bitcoin or what have you, that's been a challenge since the dawn of cryptocurrency. That might be something where we see some revenue from buying, selling, trading, but that's not the only thing that they should be doing.- Yeah, utility has certainly been difficult. Daniel Wolfe, thanks so much for taking the time here with us today. We really appreciate it.DANIEL WOLFE: Thank you so much.- Absolutely.DANIEL WOLFE: A lot of fun.]"

While light product inventories amid resilient consumption should continue to support the space, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings for the remainder of 2023.Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistent inflation continues to eat into profits. Nevertheless, the industry continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66, Murphy USA and PBF Energy.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined products' terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products.Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.Story continues3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry???s FutureMargins Fall From 2022-Highs: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or the difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will push profitability down further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.    Substantial Recovery in Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products' consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products.As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products' usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Supply-Chain, Inflation Challenges: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners' ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers.Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What's worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198, which places it in the bottom 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has gone up 8.7% over this period compared with the broader sector's increase of 4.6%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 11.6%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.13X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500's 13.98X. It is also below the sector's trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.96X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.76X, as low as 1.84X, with a median of 4.24X.4 Stocks to WatchMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA's fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA's acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 60 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 7.1%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the average being 15.6%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of MUSA have gained 8.2% in a year.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC's $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.2%. Valued at around $55.9 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Marathon Petroleum has gained 42.1% in a year.Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength. The company buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.PSX beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the average being 13.5%. Valued at around $50.6 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 Phillips 66 has gained 27.4% in a year.PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF's daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.PBF, based in Parsippany, NJ, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average being 18.5%. The Zacks #3 Ranked PBF's shares are up 42.3% in a year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

My name is Sheila, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kristina Kazarian. Kristina, you may begin.Kristina Anna KazarianWelcome to Marathon Petroleum Corporation's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. The slides that accompany this call can be found on our website at marathonpetroleum.com under the Investors tab. Joining me on the call today are Mike Hennigan, CEO; Maryann Mannen, CFO and other members of the executive team.We invite you to read the safe harbor statements on Slide 2. We will be making forward-looking statements during the call today. Actual results may differ. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included there as well as our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.Story continuesMichael J. HenniganThanks, Kristina. Good morning, everyone. Beginning with our views on the macro environment, refining margins continued strong in the second quarter. Despite crack spreads incentivizing high refining utilization, product inventory levels remain low. Global capacity additions continue to progress slower than anticipated, and we believe that global demand growth will remain strong.In the second half of the year, the refining outlook remains healthy. We expect year-over-year U.S. late product demand to grow consistent with what we saw in the first half of the year supported by lower energy prices and recovering air travel. This demand strength plus tight inventories and receding economic headwinds are expected to continue to support elevated margins. And as we completed nearly 4 quarters of elevated turnaround activity early in the second quarter, we're expecting an increase in industry-planned maintenance work by our peers in almost every region in which we operate. Overall, we believe an enhanced mid-cycle environment will continue in the U.S. due to relative advantages over international sources of supply, including energy costs, feedstock acquisition costs and refinery complexity. Now turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered strong results across our business. In Refining &amp; Marketing, strong margins, cost discipline and sound commercial performance led to segment-adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.2 billion. Our midstream segment delivered durable and growing earnings. This quarter, it generated segment-adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion which is up 5% year-over-year. MPLX remains a strategic part of MPC's portfolio as it anticipates growing it's cash flows and increasing distributions to unitholders. MPLX's distribution MPC was $502 million this quarter, an annualized rate of over $2 billion, which fully covers MPC's current dividend and half of our planned 2023 capital program, not including MPLX.During the second quarter, we progressed key projects such as completing the STAR project at the Galveston Bay refinery. The competitive position of our Galveston Bay refinery is enhanced by the increased residual fuel and heavy crude processing as well as distillate recovery. We're well positioned with 2 premier 600,000 barrel per day refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast with significant logistics and export capacity to support our global commercial strategy. At the Martinez renewable fuels facility, construction activities are progressing. Pretreatment capabilities are starting to come online in the second half of 2023, and the facility is expected to be capable of producing it's full capacity of 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023.At that point, Martinez will be among the largest, most competitive renewable diesel facilities with a competitive operating profile, robust logistics flexibility and advantaged feedstock slate and a strategic relationship with Neste. On capital allocation, in the second quarter, we returned nearly $3.4 billion to MPC shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. And from May 2021 through the end of July, we have repurchased 264 million shares or approximately 40% of the shares outstanding. Moving to our sustainability efforts. In July, we published our 12th annual sustainability report and our seventh annual perspectives on climate scenarios report. Our perspectives on climate-related scenarios which aligns with TCFD standards, provides insights into how we see the energy landscape, our thoughts on climate-related risks and opportunities, the resources we put towards addressing them and the results that we've achieved.Our sustainability report shows continued progress on goals that we have set for ourselves, our efforts to strengthen the resiliency of our operations and to innovate for the future. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Maryann.Maryann T. MannenThanks, Mike. Moving to second quarter highlights. Slide 5 provides a summary of our financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $5.32. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 billion for the quarter, and cash flow from operations excluding favorable working capital changes, was over $3.1 billion.During the quarter, we returned $316 million to shareholders through dividend payments and repurchased $3.1 billion of our shares. Slide 6 shows the reconciliation between net income and adjusted EBITDA as well as the sequential change in adjusted EBITDA from the first quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was lower sequentially, by approximately $700 million as higher refining throughput was more than offset by lower market crack spreads. Corporate expenses were roughly in line with our guidance and despite general inflationary pressures, we've maintained cost discipline since taking $100 million out of our corporate cost since 2020. The tax rate for the second quarter was 18.4%, resulting in a tax provision of approximately $583 million. Our tax provision included a $53 million discrete benefit related to prior years. Moving to our segment results. Slide 7 provides an overview of our Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Refining utilization increased 4% to 93% despite significant turnaround activity as planned work had a lower impact on crude units in the second quarter. During the quarter at Galveston Bay, an incident occurred at one of the refineries catalytic reformers. This unit has been out of service since May 15th. This resulted in approximately 2.5 million barrels of crude throughput reduction and an approximate 1% reduction to capture. Sequentially, per barrel margins were lower in the Gulf Coast and Mid-Con regions driven by lower crack spreads and our sour crude differentials. Capture was 97%, reflecting a strong result from our commercial team, particularly given the extensive turnaround activity early in the quarter. Refining operating costs were $5.15 per barrel in the second quarter, lower sequentially due to higher throughput and lower energy costs. Slide 8 provides an overview of our refining and marketing margin capture this quarter, which was 97%. Our commercial team executed effectively and achieved a strong capture result, considering a significant amount of planned and unplanned refinery downtime. Gasoline and distillate margin tailwinds were balanced against weaker secondary product pricing. We are also seeing incremental product yield and crude mix benefits from recent major capital projects. Capture results will fluctuate based on market dynamics. We believe that the capabilities we have built over the last few years will provide a sustainable advantage. This commitment to commercial performance has become foundational, and we expect to see the results of this emphasis.Slide 9 shows the change in our Midstream segment adjusted EBITDA versus the first quarter of 2023. Our midstream segment delivered strong second quarter results. Segment adjusted EBITDA while flat sequentially was 5% higher year-over-year. Our midstream business continues to grow and generate strong cash flows. We are advancing high-return growth projects anchored in the Marcellus and Permian basins. These disciplined capital investments, along with our focus on cost and portfolio optimization are expected to grow our cash flows. This will allow us to reinvest in the business and return capital to unitholders.Slide 10 presents the elements of change in our consolidated cash position for the second quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, was $3.1 billion in the quarter. Working capital was an $854 million tailwind for the quarter, driven primarily by changes in crude oil and refined product inventories. Capital expenditures and investments totaled $570 million this quarter, consistent with our 2023 outlook. MPC returned nearly $3.4 billion via share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. This represents a 108% payout of the $3.1 billion of operating cash flow, excluding changes in working capital, highlighting our commitment superior shareholder returns. And as of today, we have approximately $6.3 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. At the end of the second quarter, MPC had approximately $11.5 billion in consolidated cash and short-term investments.Turning to guidance, slide 11. We provide our third quarter outlook. We expect crude throughput volumes of roughly 2.7 million barrels per day, representing utilization of 94%. Utilization is forecasted to be higher sequentially due to lower planned turnaround activity in the third quarter, and enhanced mid-cycle margins, continue to incentivize high refining utilization. While we have not confirmed a start-up date, our throughput guidance assumes the reformer at the Galveston Bay refinery will be down for the entire quarter. Planned turnaround expense is projected to be approximately $120 million in the third quarter. Operating cost per barrel in the third quarter are expected to be $5.10, as we expect to see benefits from higher throughput and lower costs, given we have completed the significant portion of our turnaround and project activity.Distribution costs are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter. Corporate costs are expected to be $175 million, representing the sustained reductions that we have made in this area. To recap, our second quarter results reflect our team's execution against our strategic pillars across the company. Our capital allocation framework remains consistent. We will invest in sustaining our asset base while paying a secure competitive dividend with the potential for growth. We want to grow the company's earnings and we will exercise strict capital discipline. Beyond these 3 priorities, we are committed to returning excess capital through share repurchases, to meaningfully lower our share count. With that, let me pass it back to Mike.Michael J. HenniganThanks, Maryann. In summary, we will continue to invest capital to ensure the safe and reliable performance of our assets and where we believe there are attractive returns. Year-to-date, we've invested over $1.2 billion. Our focus on operational excellence and sustained commercial improvement will position us to capture this enhanced mid-cycle environment.MPLX remains a source of growth in our portfolio, distributing over $2 billion to MPC annually. And as MPLX continues to grow it's free cash flow, we believe we'll continue to have capacity to increase it's cash contributions to MPC. We believe MPC is positioned as the refinery investment of choice with the strongest through-cycle cash flow generation and the ability to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to Kristina.Kristina Anna KazarianThanks, Mike. As we open the call for your questions, as a courtesy to all participants, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. If time permits, we will reprompt for additional questions. And now we'll open the call. Sheila?Question and Answer SessionOperatorWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.Douglas George Blyth LeggateThanks for having me on. Mike, I want to pick up on one of the headlines from your press release, which seems to becoming a bit of a recurring theme, sustained commercial improvements. And I guess it's a capture rate question, but can you just walk us through what's going on in your capture? Because it looks like we're -- as I look back pre-COVID for example, leaving the distortions of COVID out of it for a minute, your capture rate seems to have stepped up. Is that portfolio management? Is it something else? Is it trading? What's going on to have addressed that issue and capture rate?Michael J. HenniganDoug, thanks for the question. I'm going to let Rick give a little more detail, but I'll start off with a couple of comments. One, we have made structural changes and have changed our commercial process quite a bit. With that said, I know yourself and a lot of the analysts like to look at that capture metric. I just want to always caution people that, the metrics that I care more about is cash flow generation and earnings profitability.So I look at that much more than that capture metric because I think there's pros and cons to it. But to your point, obviously, it has trended up and driven by a lot of the things that we've changed over the last couple of years. So I'll let Rick give a little more detail.Rick D. HesslingYes, Doug, first off, a very perceptive question. I think it's a good call out and warranted. We do believe the structural change is something that's going to stick. In fact, we continue to improve, and we're never going to be done improving in this category. So it's something that we focus on daily. So in giving you an answer, I think you'll respect that I will have to be broad as to not give away what I would call true competitive advantages. But it's all the buckets you've touched on, it's optimization, it's trading, it's all of the above. And the best way I can say it, Doug, it's a holistic change in our mindset on everything we do to optimize our assets around our size, our logistics system, our knowledge, our expertise and it's driving incremental value throughout our entire system from feedstocks to products. And there isn't anyone in the company that's not engaged. I mean I can't say enough. Our goal is to be the best cash flow generator through cycle, and this just isn't a one-and-done exercise. This is the mindset that not only our commercial team, but our entire company is attacking every day with.Douglas George Blyth LeggateWe'll continue to watch it, Rick. Thanks for the color. I guess my follow-up is also a question that it's hard not to bring this up every other quarter. But Maryann, the buyback pace in July is $800 million. Your dividend at the MPC level is about 150% covered by your distributions from MPLX. Why should we not assume that buyback should be ratable at mid-cycle at that kind of level going forward?Maryann T. MannenThanks for the question. From a capital allocation framework perspective and hopefully, even from the comments that Mike and I have both made here this morning, we remain committed to superior returns and remain committed to our capital allocation as we have defined it, as it relates to the buyback. As you know, each quarter now, we are trying to look as best as we can. We take a series of things into consideration. We look at market, we look at our cash flows and we try to do the best job we possibly can to maximize our ability to perform in a given quarter. As you've seen, $3.1 billion in the quarter. When you look from month to month, you see that visibility as you get our quarterly documents, you see a bit of variability there. But again, we remain committed. We think share repurchase is a very efficient return of capital. As it relates to the dividend, again, an important part of our capital allocation framework, as we've shared in the past, we remain committed to that. We want it to be sustainable. We certainly want to be competitive and the opportunity to grow that as well. I hope that answers your question.Douglas George Blyth LeggateMaryann, forgive me the clarification question, are you price agnostic? Because your shares are pretty much at the all-time highs well over this year?Maryann T. MannenAgain, Doug, we try to be as opportunistic as possible as we can in the quarter. So we hope that, that's the -- what you are seeing from our approach to that. So yes, we continue to buy back stock as you have seen.Unidentified Company RepresentativeLet me just add a couple of comments to it. As I just said to your first question, the #1 concentration is to generate cash. And then I'm a believer that this business has both return on and return of capital as it's requirements. So on the return on, we are investing capital to improve our earnings and grow our cash flows over time, but we're also committed to return of.So -- we used the word strict capital discipline. We set our programs such that we're going to be able to participate in both sides of that because I'm a big believer in both. We got to show the market that we can invest capital wisely to grow our earnings, and we also want to show the market that we're returning capital to the owners. So that's a program that we've been on for a while here a couple of years. We're going to continue in that mode. And I just want to give you a little bit more flavor as to how we look at it, but it all starts with generating cash and then optimizing return on and return of.OperatorNext, we will hear from Neil Meda with Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaYes. I want to get your perspective on the product market. So we've really seen a firm up here across the crack. And so any perspective you have on the strengthening -- recent strengthening of margins? And then what are you seeing from a demand perspective in your own system for diesel, jet and gas?Brian K. ParteeNeil, this is Brian. Yes, let me first comment on the demand side of the equation because we are seeing the demand side of the equation really lead the crack. So on gasoline in the quarter, our system was up. And when I say our system, it's really our entire marketing book was up 4% year-on-year versus an EIA call of about 2%.This most recent week, we see continued strength. We were up 7% last week on the gasoline pool. So we continue to see the strength, which is very encouraging as we enter the back half of the driving season here. And the West Coast has been an outsized performer, 5% on the quarter, 8% last week. And then looking at diesel, it's been largely flat. EIA has got a call for the quarter of up about 1%. And of course, I think everybody has pretty dialed into Jet. We had a 9% increase on the quarter for jet fuel demand year-on-year versus EIA of about 3%. And just real quick on the crack. I would say that the big story here over the last 30 to 60 days has been the distillate. So I mean, our view is distillate really ran up late last year, obviously, with the situation in Ukraine, uncertainty around sanctions in the first part of this year over in EU. And now we have a lot more certainty. So the market came off pretty precipitously since the beginning of the year, and now we're seeing it recover to a more fundamental level.Neil Singhvi MehtaThe follow-up is just around the dividend. It's down to about 2% given how strong stock has been (inaudible) perspective and just your perspective on, is there headroom to raise the fixed dividend and remind us again when you typically would do that?Maryann T. MannenNeil, thanks for the question. It's Maryann. So as I mentioned, hopefully, you see that we've got a couple of criteria for the dividend obviously, yield only being one of them, sustainability of that and obviously, the potential to grow. So as we've committed, we'll be back next quarter with our intentions to share with you our plans for the dividend. So next quarter, consistent with our approach from last year as well. I hope that answers your question.OperatorOur next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS.Manav GuptaMy question is like this year, you are bringing to conclusion 2 of your big mega projects, the Galveston as well as the Martinez RD. At this point, you haven't indicated another mega project. So should we assume in the year 2024, more of your CapEx would be dedicated to quick hit projects, which generally are not that expensive. And that can mean that year-over-year, 2024 CapEx could be down versus 2023, unless you pick up a mega project at this stage?Maryann T. MannenIt's Maryann and thanks for the question. I think you characterized it well. As we shared with you, STAR is largely behind us. And as you heard from our comments as well, Martinez on it's way to be with this next phase up and running by the end of the quarter. As you know, we're a bit early to give 2024 guidance. We'll get a little bit closer to that and give you some more color we intend to give you, as we have in prior quarters, to look at what we would be contemplating spending in refining as well as our low-carbon initiatives as well. But I think you stated it well. We haven't talked about any significant major projects here to for. Hope that helps.Michael J. HenniganManav, this is Mike. I just want to add. It's just a little early in the year. We obviously have some insight as to what we're planning to do in '24, but we'll talk about that in subsequent quarters as opposed to now.Manav GuptaI completely understand. My quick follow-up here is, as I understand, when you first envisioned the Martinez project, it was more of so being refined unrefined. As you brought in the partner somewhere your own thought process or what you want to run changed. And at this stage, you are looking at a higher percentage of lower CI feedstocks versus soybean. Can you comment a little bit on that?Brian K. ParteeYes, Manav, this is Brian. Certainly, you got it pretty dead on there in terms of the strategy and the strategic relationship we have with Neste. Just a couple of things to mention around your question, though, that we are on start-up diet here. So as mentioned, we've got our pretreatment facility coming online and really the full horsepower of this facility really enters in the back half of this year, but we're quite confident in our ability with our relationship with Neste that really is looking beyond just Martinez. This is just the beginning of our relationship. But one point of view that I will share with you, not Martinez specific, but to give just a little bit of perspective, we just exited July with our operation up in Dickinson, and we ran a 74% advantaged feed slate out of our facility up in Dickinson. And it's start-up design was very similar to Martinez. So hopefully, that frames things up for you a little bit better of what to expect when we get Martinez up to full rate later this year.Michael J. HenniganManav, it's Mike. I just want to add that when we look at the project, we try and challenge ourselves as Brian said, without the advantaged feedstock to make sure we're comfortable that we have a good project even in that conservative nature. And then obviously, the commercial teams are going to work very hard to optimize the feedstocks whether it's to our other refineries or to the RD facilities. But we try and start out before we deploy that capital in such a way that we feel comfortable that we'll have upside as we do better commercially on the feedstock side.OperatorNext, you will hear from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.Paul ChengMike, I think in the past, you said if we're looking at your refining portfolio, cars and they see the biggest potential upside. So -- is there any kind of investment initiative that are you currently thinking on that to capture that upside? That's the first question.Second question that maybe this is for Rick. When I'm looking at the third quarter, your throughput guidance, which has actually come in that to be about exactly the same as the second quarter, but the turnaround activity is significantly lower. So are we missing something? Or is that that number is just being very conservative, that one we had thought with the turnaround activity is much lower you will have a much higher throughput than the second quarter.Michael J. HenniganIt's Mike. I'll start on the first one, I'll let Rick take the second one. Similar to Manav's question is -- we'll give a little more color on 2024 capital in the next couple of quarters. We do have some projects that we think will continue to optimize our portfolio and improve upon it. But like I said a few minutes ago, it's a little early to talk about that capital at this point. So if you can just hold your thought, we'll give a little bit more on the next quarter and start to give you a little bit more insight as to what we're thinking in '24.Rick D. HesslingYes. Paul, it's Rick. So on our throughput guidance for 3Q, you're correct, it is lighter than 2Q, and we see that as an advantage, especially as a lot of our competitors have heavier turnaround work in 3Q. But with that being said, Paul, I think the one difference maybe that you're not accounting for is the reformer outage. So when you factor that in, that really takes you to where we landed in our guidance, Paul. That's really the only difference.Paul ChengRick, can I clarify on that because the [reformer] was done since mid May -- and so this is only going to be I think maybe half of our 1/4 of the down timing. So that what dropped you 30,000, 40,000 barrels per day in total throughput. So -- and still is a really be surprised that the book level is not higher on the guidance for third quarter?Maryann T. MannenPaul, it's Maryann. Let me try to provide incremental color into all the commentary that Rick has given you. So you're right, in the second quarter, the reformer was down from May 15th to the end of the quarter. For purpose of guidance this quarter, what we have assumed is we would not be operational at all. So it's about 75,000 a day, when we talk about the impact last quarter, it was about 1%. If you look at the impact, just strictly in the U.S. Gulf Coast from the absence of that particular unit not operating, it's about a 7% reduction quarter-over-quarter in U.S. Gulf Coast, and that's about a 3% overall to the whole system. So hopefully, that's helpful to you.OperatorOur next question will come from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.Sam Jeffrey MargolinThis is a macro question, and I want to harken back to a call, a Marathon call from earlier this year. I think it was Brian made the prediction that the Russian sanctions, first diesel cracks will go down and then they would go up again, and that's sort of exactly what happened and it has to do with the destock pattern and then later on, specification issues. And so I just want to bring that comment back to the service here and see if it is part of the reason for the strength we're seeing in diesel cracks now. And if you see in your export markets, for example, if you see a shortage of on-spec products that's driving some of the strength there?Brian K. ParteeGood to hear from you. Yes, absolutely. We are seeing things played out as we expected. I mentioned it earlier. I think the big thing with the Russian situation was the uncertainty, and I think the market has become much more certain today for all of us in terms of really limited friction on Russian distillate barrels hitting the world market. We have seen a little bit of market share exchange, deeper penetration of Russian barrels into Latin America, notably Brazil, an exchange share for the U.S. system into Europe. So we're seeing here in the last couple of months, almost 300,000 barrels a day of distillate exports to backfill the European market. And what we're hearing from customers over in Europe is really energy security. No surprise, this is a big driving factor for them. So with our team over in London right now, operating really, really strong, we are finding really good traction for our book over into Europe. But to your broader question on demand, the export market has been very stable and strong for many cycles now and continues to be our outlook going forward, the case on both gasoline and distillate.Sam Jeffrey MargolinAnd then this is an operational follow-up, but we've seen heavy intermediate differentials compress and it seems to correspond to a bunch of different factors, maybe starting up as one of them, but -- there's a couple of other similar new conversion units and new refining capacity starting up concurrently. And then you have the OPEC cuts. And so just on this heavy light set up and specifically on high-sulfur fuel oil, is the tightness here just a function of all of these things happening at once? And then over time, the market will adjust and we might see just if I go back towards where it was? Or is this kind of the normalization with all the new capacity?Brian K. ParteeYes, Sam, this is Brian. A couple of data points on that. So if you look at the heavy sulfur distillate spread, of course, we swung real, real low last year. And of course, the system was in max distillate mode. So we were producing we, the whole entire refining complex is producing as much diesel as possible, which generated more high sulfur distillate, which outran hydrotreating capacity by and large, as we've come off of Max diesel mode, and we've been in gasoline mode here as a system this summer. We've seen that retrench. So more of a traditional relationship. So I think the factor to look at is really, are we in Max gas or Max diesel mode. Some of the things you mentioned are nominally impactful. But if you're looking specifically at the Gulf Coast, the one kind of watch out is it's a very thinly traded market, so it can move quite dramatically up or down depending on what's occurring in the system.Rick D. HesslingSam, this is Rick. Just to tag on to what Brian was saying, as part of your question, the heavy light crude differentials. So we do believe the bottom is in. We're actually quite optimistic. We believe that spread will get wider point forward through the end of this year. And it's really for a variety of reasons. You've got increased planned turnaround work specifically in PADD 2 and 3 that's going to take some crude demand needs off the table. So that will cause some length. You've got the Canadian producers that have come out of their maintenance season, and they are running well. And then you've got incremental Gulf of Mexico and Venezuela production from Chevron clearing to the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when we look at the markers and specifically, Sam, on heavy Canadian, it hit it's low in around June at about a $10 discount. The current trade cycles got it at about a $14 discount. So it's widened out even significantly here over the last 30 days. And we continue to see it widening out further when you look at the forward curve between now and the end of the year.OperatorNext, we will hear from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.Jason Daniel GabelmanI want to key in on a couple of macro comments Mike made on the top of the call. I was hoping you could elaborate. First, he mentioned higher maintenance moving forward in almost every region that you operate in. It sounded like from Rick's answer just now that was going to be impact you in PADD 3. So one, can you confirm that? And is that higher maintenance sequentially? Or is it higher than what you would typically expect in the fall?And then secondly, on the macro, you mentioned some refinery startups globally are a bit delayed. I was wondering if there are any sites, in particular, that you had in mind? And I have a follow-up.Michael J. HenniganYes, Jason, it's Mike. I'll start, and then I'll let Rick jump in. What I was saying in the prepared remarks is we as a company have gone through 4 quarters of pretty heavy turnaround. And so we're later into the rest of the year, compared to what we see as the industry, and we'll have to see how it plays out, but it looks like the industry has a lot more activity into the rest of the year. So that's what I was trying to say as far as the difference between where we are and where we think the rest of the industry is.Rick D. HesslingYes. And then I'll just tag on. In terms of global refining capacity, what we found, and it appears to continue to be true is overpromise and under-deliver. So generally speaking, I really don't think it's appropriate to give you specifics. But generally speaking, we're seeing delays versus others throughout the world, meeting their projections of when that -- when their utilization is going to come online. So more of a general comment,Jason Daniel GabelmanOkay. Great. And my follow-up is on the Martinez biofuels projects. I just wanted to confirm because it's tough to tell. It sounds like everything is going according to plan, but we've heard from industry sources that there are some court challenges that you're having to address. Is that fair in terms of what's going on? And is there any risk that any of these court challenges could impact the ramp up of the project to the full 730 million gallons?Unidentified Company RepresentativeSo there were 6 challenges to our land use permit. We prevailed on 5 of them. And the one is currently still being briefed with the court, and we anticipate a favorable outcome here in the upcoming months. So nothing projected to impact construction and/or operation.Jason Daniel GabelmanTo clarify, you need -- can you ramp up while that court is ongoing -- while our case is ongoing? Or would you need that to be resolved before you ramp up capacity?Unidentified Company RepresentativeNo. We can continue both on construction and with the operation.OperatorOur next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadI'd like to follow up as well on Martinez. Maybe just if you can help us out with understanding some of the milestones we should watch? We know that the industry has been challenging times to get these facilities to start up cleanly. You've obviously put out a goal of full run rate by the end of the year. So as we think about this point in late October, looking back at the third quarter, where would you expect to see that unit? And when would you anticipate that it becomes a positive contributor in terms of EBITDA, cash flow, earnings.Timothy GriffithRoger, this is Tim. I'll take that question. So first off, the remaining construction activities at Martinez, they are on schedule and things are going very well. As both Brian and Mike indicated early on in the prepared remarks and the Q&amp;A, we recently started up a portion of the Martinez's pretreatment unit. And we're now pretreating on-site with one train that will really just support the Phase 1 volumes. The big ticket item, though, is when we ramp up with the second train at the end of the year when we bring alongside the RD capacity when the facility conversion is complete. So I would give it positive remarks. Team is doing a great job and we look forward to the end of the year.Michael J. HenniganRoger, it's Mike. To your question, financially, you got to be thinking into '24. As Tim said, we're ramping, we're starting up. We're going to bring on the additional units and if all goes well, we'll be on by the end of the year. So you'll start to see the financial performance more in '24 on a go-forward basis.Roger David ReadThat makes sense. And then maybe this question is for Maryann. Dickinson is a very small operation, so I understand as part of refining, but now that it's going to be a much bigger overall operation, Granted, you own half of it via the Neste joint venture, but how should we think about from a reporting accounting standpoint? When -- or will we see a breakout of renewable diesel operations from the rest of the business?Maryann T. MannenThanks for the question, Roger. As you said, as it relates to Dickinson first, we've been operating for about 2 years, and consistent with the way we have expected profitability there, although some of the moving parts are different. We continue to see the performance of that consistency with what we thought. Mike just shared with you when we should expect to see real contribution from Martinez. So we will evaluate both Dickinson and Martinez in terms of their total contribution. As you know, we've said for 2023, we are not planning to break that out. But we'll come back to you as we continue to move along our path of profitability for both Dickinson and Martinez.Michael J. HenniganRoger, it's Mike. The other thing, and I know you know this already, but obviously, the refining assets cash flows are significantly higher than what's happening in renewable diesel. I think the way you should think about that is, us looking at all our assets, and we talk about portfolio optimization to take 2 assets that we did not think would be competitive long term and deserving of investing capital and it put them in a positive cash flow mode going forward, obviously, in a diesel mode as opposed to a crude mode. So I think it's more of a portfolio optimization realization compared to where we are on refining cash flows.Roger David ReadWell, I'll just leave you with my final thoughts on it, which is we haven't really put a lot in valuation uplift because it's difficult to know exactly what some of the contributions will be in where. So I think more disclosure will be a positive for you.OperatorOur next question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.John Macalister RoyallSo my first question is just coming back to the Galveston Bay reformer. Is there an update on when we could see that coming back? I know you're assuming out for the full quarter with 3Q guidance, but maybe just a little bit of color on where you are in that restart process beyond just that assumption in your guidance?Timothy GriffithSo John, this is Tim. I'll take part of that. And all I can really share is that we are expeditiously and prudently completing the repairs on that unit. And we don't have any further guidance beyond what Maryann has already provided relative to schedule.John Macalister RoyallFair enough. And my next question is on tax. You had a very low rate in 2Q. You called out a $50 million-ish of that looks nonrecurring, but even when I adjust for that, it's still trending down the past couple of quarters. Is that just on the mix of nontaxable MPLX versus refining, with refining coming down past couple of quarters? Are there any other moving pieces to think about in the tax rate?Maryann T. MannenJohn, it's Maryann. Yes, thanks for that. So as we stated, the $53 million that I called out for you is related to prior periods. It's a good news story. We were successful on a resolution of an item that has prior period benefit, and it will have some, but albeit smaller benefit going forward. And that's about $0.13 in the quarter. As you stated, typically the biggest mover on our rate is the relationship between our midstream business and our refining business. But from time to time, we could also have discrete items. Those items could be positive or negative. And in some cases, they are positive. But as you stated, the typical driver there, when you look at our federal rate and the state tax rate would be that relationship.John Macalister RoyallSo if I adjusted out the $53 million in this quarter, that's a decent run rate to think about going forward?Maryann T. MannenOne of the things that you've said when you look at that rate, it's a little bit lower than average. I think you're probably coming to around a 20% ZIP code in the quarter. As you've seen from last year, we've run about 22%. So there is a range there, but certainly, 20% is at the lower end of that when you look at the relationships between refining and midstream today.OperatorOur next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays.Theresa ChenI just had a quick follow-up related to the discussion of the Martinez ramp up and your renewable diesel outlook in general. Related to the economics of LCFS, it seems that the final draft of the proposed changes will be submitted to CARB over the next couple of months. And I'd love to hear your thoughts and expectations on where you see that landing and your general outlook for pricing from here?Brian K. ParteeTheresa, this is Brian. Yes, so we've been very actively involved with CARB on the valuation of the reset. We remain optimistic. We believe CARB foundationally wants to find a way to support the program. Obviously, LCFS prices have come off fairly precipitously over the last couple of years as RD has penetrated. So we are expecting support for the market. But note, LCFS is the smallest variable in our overall value equation. So it's not been a big needle mover, but we do think it's important going forward to underpin the profitability on the RD space. In addition, obviously, we're looking at markets beyond California. So as LCFS prices come down in California, there's other state-level programs on the West Coast and beyond that we're finding opportunities to penetrate with our RD market position.OperatorOur next question will come from Matthew Blair with TPH.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairChicago diesel cracks were quite weak earlier in July, even related to other PADD 2 markets like Group III. Do you have any color on what was going on here? It looks like they recovered so far, but any color as to why Chicago Diesel at one point was negative on an RBO adjusted basis?Brian K. ParteeYes. Matthew, this is Brian. Yes, it's a great question. Clearly overdone. It's recovered fully. The unique nature of the Chicago Complex is the marker is in the far west side of Chicago, which from time to time can get pretty volatile. And I think really, that's what we saw from a trade basis over on the west side of Chicago, but it's recovered quite nicely here as we've trended out of that period of time. And we remain optimistic that we're in a good position as we head into the harvest season here in the Midwest where we expect to see distillate strength.Matthew Robert Lovseth BlairIt sounds good. And then the CARB data posted last night showed that in the first quarter of this year, California diesel consumption was 49% RD and up to 8% [BD]. For your Los Angeles refinery, are you having any problems placing your petroleum diesel volumes in that California market? And are you having to export new volumes to Singapore or Mexico? Do you consider that a risk down the road?Brian K. ParteeYes, Matthew, this is Brian. On the prop basis, no, no problems clearing the barrels. But yes, you're on point there. As RD penetrates the California market, it's a one-for-one relationship. It's fairly balanced. I'll say the West Coast system as a whole, that our expectation and planning horizon does include the ability to make sure that we can export barrels beyond the U.S. In addition, obviously, Jet is very, very strong right now. So if you look at the yield structure in terms of how we're running the refineries, we're working really, really hard to make sure that we're maximizing jet fuel at the cost of the distillate side of the book.OperatorWe do have time for just one more question. Our last question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.Ryan M. ToddMaybe a question on the refining side. On the Gulf Coast, you had very strong performance despite the downtime at the reformer at Galveston Bay. Can you -- I'm curious as to how much contribution you saw from the STAR expansion in the quarter? And maybe just an update on how the expansion of that project is going forward and contribution in the future?Maryann T. MannenYes. Thanks for the question, Ryan. It's Maryann. Let me try to give you a little bit of color. When you look at Q1 to Q2 performance, keep in mind in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as you stated, we were under turnaround in the first quarter and obviously ramping up. So you saw the benefits of that, obviously, in the second quarter despite the fact that we did have the reform or down for just a portion of the month. As I was commenting on, it's only about a 1% impact for the second quarter that will get a little bit larger, as I shared, given the fact that we're assuming it to be down.I think the other thing to keep in mind is typically when we look at cost in the quarter, when we're doing heavy turnarounds as we did in the first quarter, we're typically doing other maintenance work and that was much lighter in the second quarter as well. As it relates to STAR, as you know, we were ramping up our comments as we've been sharing STAR was ramping up through the second quarter. So minimal impact with respect to STAR, but you'll begin to see that now as we've reached the completion of that project.Ryan M. ToddGreat. And maybe just kind of a high-level question. You've obviously been active today in various low-carbon transportation fuels, meaningful investment in renewable diesel, even a recent investment in an RNG producer. As you look at the long-term outlook for transportation fuels in your markets over the next 10 years, how are you thinking about your overall strategy for the transition? In particular, maybe a sense of your role in a broader definition of transportation fuels. And where do you go from here in terms of potential future investments?Michael J. HenniganYes, Ryan, it's Mike. I like the word energy evolution more than energy transition. I know a lot of people use energy transition, but I think it's going to evolve over a longer period of time than most have written about. So we're trying to be very thoughtful. We will be using the word evolve. We will evolve the company over time. As you pointed out, 2 of our facilities now are renewable diesel. We made a small investment in an RNG facility. So Dave and his team are looking at all those opportunities. We talked on the call earlier today about we're active in some of the DOE hydrogen hubs, and we'll see how that plays out over time. So think of us is going to be very thoughtful. We try to use the word strict capital discipline. We do want to invest as opportunities present themselves, but we are committed to getting solid returns. So overall, I'd say you're just going to see us chip away at little activities over time and constantly evolve it to your point about, what are we going to look like in 10 years? And 10 years, 20 years or whatever Marathon has been around for 130 years. We plan to be around for 130 more. So we'll evolve the company as the market dictates. And obviously, consumer preferences, regulatory impacts, all those things are going to drive what happens and we'll be very attentive to it and we'll look to deploy capital as we see the opportunities.Kristina Anna KazarianAll right.

While light product inventories amid resilient consumption should continue to support the space, most sector operators are projected to post weaker year-over-year quarterly earnings for the remainder of 2023. Worse still, the rise in costs on the back of persistent inflation continues to eat into profits. Nevertheless, the industry continues to benefit from strong product demand due to increasing travel and mobility. In the present environment, we advise investors to look at fundamentally solid companies like Marathon Petroleum MPC, Phillips 66 PSX, Murphy USA MUSA and PBF Energy PBF.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined products’ terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks, and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences, and capacity utilization in the refining industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing Industry???s FutureMargins Fall From 2022-Highs: While refining margins are still relatively healthy, they have moderated considerably from the spectacular levels of 2022. Crack spreads (or the difference between the price of refined products and crude oil) have come down too. Recessionary impact, if any, will push profitability down further. With oil exports from Russia continuing to find new outlets like India and China despite price caps and sanctions, product supplies have not tightened to the extent that was expected. This implies that global refinery margins have lately lost steam, depressing the profits of the downstream companies.     Substantial Recovery in Fuel Demand: Of late, refiners have been supported by a marked improvement in refined products’ consumption — primarily gasoline and diesel — on the back of increasing travel and mobility. Per the U.S. Energy Department's latest release, gasoline inventories are around 7% below the five-year average, signaling robust oil product usage in the market. In other words, this indicates surging consumption of gasoline, diesel and other refined products. As economic activity remains resilient and Americans take to the road with a vengeance amid post-pandemic recovery, refined products’ usage should continue to gain traction throughout 2023. The refiners should also benefit from increased driving and accelerating international travel.Supply-Chain, Inflation Challenges: Despite the relatively bullish energy landscape and improved demand environment, the industry has not been immune to supply-chain disruptions and cost inflation. Macro issues like higher transportation expenses, driver scarcity and labor shortages have limited refiners’ ability to ship packaged volumes to their customers. Most operators have also felt the impact of inflation, which is rolling through the cost structure. What’s worse is that these headwinds across the system and the subsequent hit to profitability (due to difficulty in passing through the increased costs to clients) are expected to continue in the near future.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates a Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #198, which places it in the bottom 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Outperforms Sector But Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining &amp; Marketing industry has fared better than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year but has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the same period.The industry has gone up 8.7% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 4.6%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 11.6%.One-Year Price Performance Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 2.13X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 13.98X. It is also below the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.96X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.76X, as low as 1.84X, with a median of 4.24X, as the chart below shows.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (Past Five Years)  4 Stocks to WatchMurphy USA: It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps the company to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA’s acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain located — is expected to help improve its offerings.Over the past 60 days, this El Dorado, AR-based Murphy USA has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 improve 7.1%. MUSA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the average being 15.6%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of MUSA have gained 8.2% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Price and Consensus: MUSA Marathon Petroleum: The company is a leading independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. MPC’s $23.3 billion acquisition of Andeavor has integrated the premier assets of both companies, bolstering the scale and leadership position of the combined entity in the United States. As it is, Marathon Petroleum's access to lower cost of crude in the Permian, Bakken, and Canada helps it to benefit from the differentials.MPC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 14.2%. Valued at around $55.9 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Marathon Petroleum has gained 42.1% in a year.Price and Consensus: MPC  Phillips 66: Phillips 66 is one of the leading refining players in terms of size, efficiency and strength. The company buys, sells and refines crude oil and other feedstocks at its refineries. PSX, with a throughput capacity of 2 million barrels per day, owns an interest in 12 refineries in the United States and Europe. Moreover, it owns 7,110 branded U.S. outlets and 1,700 international ones.PSX beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the average being 13.5%. Valued at around $50.6 billion, the Zacks Rank #3 Phillips 66 has gained 27.4% in a year.Price and Consensus: PSX PBF Energy: PBF Energy has one of the most complex refining systems in the United States. As a result, the firm has the capacity to generate lighter and better grades of refined products. PBF’s daily processing capacity of 1,000,000 barrels of crude is higher than most of its peers.PBF, based in Parsippany, NJ, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average being 18.5%.

And we saw the trend that we've been talking about for a couple of months now, guys, a decline in Bud Light sales, what did that mean for Molson Coors. Molson Coors delivered its single strongest quarter of net sales since Molson and Coors merged in 2005.Now, revenue did come in actually a little bit lower than analysts had projected, not by much, but they singled out that Bud Light sales have been declining. And it led to benefits for what they've seen in Miller Lite sales, Coors Light sales. Now, the most important highlight of that, though, the stock closed down today, because some of that might already be sort of priced into the story, right? We've been talking about this story for a couple of months now, Pras, specifically over here in our little round table. And it seems like we might have already seen some of these benefits into the stock already.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, look, I'm just still surprised at the lasting staying power of this Bud Light sort of boycott. We saw Modelo sales be the top selling brand in America for beer. And now, we're seeing Molson Coors brands, Coors Light, Coors Light, and Miller Lite topping Bud Light. I mean, look, they're all substitutable--JOSH SCHAFER: No. What was the face on Coors Light? Because we can get into it. Are you not a Coors Light fan?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: They're all the same-- Coors Light, in my opinion, is like worse than Miller Lite.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I think they all basically taste the same. And that's what this discourse has been.Story continuesPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. So you're not surprising that you would substitute one light filling, very, very, you know, just like water type beer for another one. But it's like I'm upset about the Dillon Mulvaney thing, right? That's the audience or the viewer or drinker sort of reaction.So I just can't-- I'm surprised at how long the staying power is. I saw a report today that Bud Light wholesalers are saying, we don't see this ending. This has gone on for a long time.JOSH SCHAFER: That's the part, Seana, that I think is interesting. And that's what a lot of street analysts are saying, too, is to process point, if they all taste like water and are already switched to a different water, who really cares what kind of water they drink?SEANA SMITH: I guess, if you're saying. I actually think Bud Light is pretty good. If we're going to be judging the taste of it, I think Coors Light is fine.JOSH SCHAFER: With a lemon. With a lemon only.SEANA SMITH: With a lemon, that's what I always say. It helps it taste a little bit better. But I think this also just speaks to a larger issue. And we've talked about this time and time again. This boycott coming at a very tough time for Anheuser-Busch, really for any player within this space. When we talk about the fact that fewer and fewer people are drinking beer, they're opting for other alternatives that are out there right now. So combining that with this boycott, clearly, it's a very, very tough time for Anheuser-Busch.In terms of the reaction that we're seeing in the stock today, Josh, I think you're exactly right, because I think a lot of this has already been priced in. We've seen a number of analysts on the Street either upgrade their outlook for Molson Coors, raise their price targets because of the fact that this boycott was lasting so much longer than I think almost anyone had anticipated. Whether or not that is gone for good, we're hearing more and more people say, to what you guys are saying, that is exactly right. We're not going to see people shift back to Bud LIght.So I think the question now is, what exactly is going to be the strategy from Anheuser-Busch? What can they do in order to regain some of that market share? Maybe it's not betting so much on beer. Maybe it's betting more so on that ready-to-drink cocktail on some of the other options that younger drinkers tend to gravitate to.JOSH SCHAFER: And one other thing I want to highlight while we're talking about this, of course, is Anheuser-Busch earnings are on Thursday, right? And I just took a look, the stock is only down 5% year-to-date, but when you think about how much we've been talking-- how much we've been talking about this, how much the sales have been down. We've seen sales fall as much as 30% on a weekly basis for Bud Light compared to the year prior.And I think part of it is, in a larger context, in America, we focus so much on Bud Light, because a lot of people drink it here. But Anheuser-Busch is a global company. And I they'll probably talk a lot about that on Thursday and the other parts of revenue that they still have going. But it's going to be interesting to see how that stock reacts on Thursday, because, you know, the numbers aren't going to be good. And they're going to have to admit that things aren't going that well. So what is the turnaround strategy? Can you see that stock not fully tank on Thursday when the bad numbers come out?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Real quick, you mentioned other types of drinks, you know, spirits overtook beer recently. And I think Cutwater-- is it the name of that brand that Bud owns, that's like they mix drink sort of alternative? That's doing well. All my favorite hard seltzer is doing well. So maybe that's where we're going to see that growth.]"

However, both metrics improved year over year. Results have gained from the strong performance across its portfolio and both business units. However, the ongoing macroeconomic environment and beer industry softness acted as deterrents.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 7.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 1.2%. However, shares of TAP fell more than 6% before the trading session on Aug 1.Quarterly DetailsThe company’s adjusted earnings of $1.78 per share jumped 50% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Net sales grew 12% to $3,267 million but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,309 million. On a constant-currency basis, net sales rose 12.1%, driven by a favorable price and sales mix, and higher financial volume.Net sales per hectoliter increased 8.7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong net pricing, and a favorable sales mix stemming from the premiumization and geographic mix.Molson Coors’ worldwide brand volumes rose 5% to 22.8 million, driven by strength in America, partially offset by the sluggishness in EMEA&amp;APAC. Financial volumes advanced 2.8% to 23.4 million hectoliters due to higher volumes in the Americas, partly offset by increased EMEA&amp;APAC volumes.Underlying (non-GAAP) earnings before income taxes (EBT) advanced 53% year over year to $502.2 million. On a constant-currency basis, EBT jumped 53% due to higher net pricing, rising financial volumes, increased pricing and a positive sales mix, somewhat offset by cost inflation related to materials and manufacturing expenses, as well as higher MG&amp;A expenses.Segmental InformationMolson Coors operates under the following geographical segments.Americas: Net sales in the segment increased 10.7% to $2,621.7 million on a reported basis and rose 11.5% on a constant-currency basis, driven by a positive price and sales mix, as well as higher financial volume, partly offset by unfavorable currency. The metric came ahead of our estimate of $2,439.1 million. Financial volumes rose 5% year over year, driven by an increase in U.S. domestic shipments stemming from volume growth in its premium brands, as well as higher shipments inCanada.Brand volume for the segment increased 8% year over year on an 8.7% rise in the United States, owing to double-digit growth across Coors Light, Miller Lite and Coors Banquet. Canada brand volumes rose 11.3%, driven by cycling the prior-year impacts of the Québec labor strike. Meanwhile, Latin America declined 5.9% due to industry softness in some major markets.Net sales per hectoliter rose 5.4% year over year due to a favorable sales and price mix, and higher net pricing. Underlying EBT improved 40% on a constant-currency basis to $487.6 million. The increase can be attributed to higher pricing, rising financial volumes, lower logistics expenses and a favorable sales mix, offset by cost inflation on materials, conversion, and higher MG&amp;A expenses.EMEA&amp;APAC: The segment’s net sales (on a reported basis) grew 16.3% to $649 million and improved 14.7% on a constant-currency basis, driven by a favorable price and sales mix, as well as favorable currency, partly offset by a decline in financial volume. The metric came ahead of our estimate of $560.8 million. Net sales per hectoliter for the segment advanced 19.9%, resulting from a favorable sales mix, as well as higher pricing, offset by currency headwinds.The segment’s financial volumes fell 3%, while the brand volume decreased 2.9% due to declines in Central and Eastern Europe, stemming from inflationary pressures, partially offset by resilient demand and growth in above premium volumes in the U.K.The segment’s underlying EBT increased 85% to a loss of $64.2 million on a reported basis and improved 83% on a constant-currency basis, driven by higher net pricing to customers, favorable sales mix, offset by lower financial volumes and cost inflation, particularly in materials, logistics and manufacturing expenses.Story continuesOther Financial UpdatesMolson Coors ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $960.9 million. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had a total debt of $6,615.1 million, resulting in a net debt of $5,654.2 million.In the six months ending Jun 30, 2023, the company provided $894.4 million in cash by operating activities, resulting in an underlying free cash flow of $569.7 million.

These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Company's definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this release.Cautionary StatementThis release contains ""forward-looking"" statements regarding future results and events. For this purpose, any statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words ""feels"", ""believes"", ""anticipates"", ""plans"", ""expects"", ""intends"", ""suggests"", ""appears"", ""estimates"", ""projects"" and similar expressions, whether in the negative or affirmative, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements within this release for a variety of reasons, including and without limitation, risks related to, expectations or ability to realize commercial success subsequent to the completion of the Wyatt transaction; the impact of this transaction on the Company's business, anticipated progress on Waters' research programs, development of new analytical instruments and associated software or consumables, manufacturing development and capabilities; the increased indebtedness of the Company as a result of the Wyatt transaction, the repayment of which could impact the Company's future results, market prospects for its products and sales and earnings guidance; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations potentially affecting translation of the Company's future non-U.S. operating results, particularly when a foreign currency weakens against the U.S. dollar; current global economic, sovereign and political conditions and uncertainties, including the effect of new or proposed tariff or trade regulations; changes in inflation and interest rates; the impacts and costs of war, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine; and the possibility of further escalation resulting in new geopolitical and regulatory instability; the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the Chinese government's ongoing tightening of restrictions on procurement by government-funded customers; the Company's ability to access capital, maintain liquidity and service the Company's debt in volatile market conditions; risks related to the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects; changes in timing and demand for the Company's products among the Company's customers and various market sectors, particularly as a result of fluctuations in their expenditures or ability to obtain funding; the ability to realize the expected benefits related to the Company's various cost-saving initiatives; the introduction of competing products by other companies and loss of market share, as well as pressures on prices from competitors and/or customers; changes in the competitive landscape as a result of changes in ownership, mergers and continued consolidation among the Company's competitors; regulatory, economic and competitive obstacles to new product introductions; lack of acceptance of new products and inability to grow organically through innovation; rapidly changing technology and product obsolescence; risks associated with previous or future acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures and divestitures, including risks associated with contingent purchase price payments and expansion of our business into or developing markets; risks associated with unexpected disruptions in operations; failure to adequately protect the Company's intellectual property, infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties and inability to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms; the Company's ability to acquire adequate sources of supply and its reliance on outside contractors for certain components and modules, as well as disruptions to its supply chain; risks associated with third-party sales intermediaries and resellers; the impact and costs of changes in statutory or contractual tax rates in jurisdictions in which the Company operates as well as shifts in taxable income among jurisdictions with different effective tax rates, the outcome of ongoing and future tax examinations and changes in legislation affecting the Company's effective tax rate; the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified employees and management personnel; risks associated with cybersecurity and technology, including attempts by third parties to defeat the security measures of the Company and its third-party partners; increased regulatory burdens as the Company's business evolves, especially with respect to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, among others, and in connection with government contracts; regulatory, environmental, and logistical obstacles affecting the distribution of the Company's products, completion of purchase order documentation and the ability of customers to obtain letters of credit or other financing alternatives; risks associated with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings; and the impact and costs incurred from changes in accounting principles and practices. Such factors and others are discussed more fully in the sections entitled ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors"" of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as in the sections entitled ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" and ""Risk Factors"" of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended April 1, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), which discussions are incorporated by reference in this release, as updated by the Company's future filings with the SEC.

After their prepared remarks, we will be pleased to take your questions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Phil.Story continuesPhillip M. EylerThank you, Yijing. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with the continued strong execution of the global Gentherm team as we delivered another solid quarter of financial and operating results.While we have seen some stabilization in automotive production and signs of easing inflation, we continue to strengthen our operational execution and further improve productivity. For the second quarter, we achieved record revenue of $372 million, growing 43% year-over-year. These outstanding results also included record quarterly organic revenue of over $300 million, the highest ever quarterly revenue for our climate controlled seats, and the highest ever quarterly revenue for steering wheel heaters in the company's history. Demand for our thermal comfort, massage and lumbar solutions continues to accelerate. This momentum has carried into 2023. In the second quarter, we achieved a quarterly record of $670 million of new automotive business awards. Year-to-date, we have secured nearly $1.2 billion of new awards. Recall that in 2022, we secured record wins of $1.8 billion for the full year. With this extraordinary strength in new business wins, we are preparing to gear up to meet the production demands of our customers, along we're creating a more optimal cost structure in our manufacturing footprint. And I'm pleased to announce that we are investing in two new manufacturing plants, one in Morocco and one in Monterrey, Mexico. The new factories will be ready for production in 2024. These new plants will not only allow us to meet the capacity requirements of our record levels of new business awards, but also support our plan to keep expanding gross margins. Turning back to our Q2 results, which Matteo will cover in more detail in a few minutes. Our adjusted EBITDA margin rate improved 300 basis points year-over-year on a pro forma basis. We generated a $34 million of cash flow from operations, repaid $16 million of debt and repurchased $10 million of shares in the quarter. We have officially kicked off our Fit for Growth 2.0 program to execute our previously announced profitability improvement plan to reach high teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate by 2026. Specifically, we have identified several hundred initiatives to reduce product costs through value engineering, sourcing excellence, improved manufacturing productivity through automation, and implement lean best practices across our network. Additionally, the program will drive operating expense efficiency to leverage scale as we continue our growth path towards our target of over $2 billion by 2026. Now turning to the automotive highlights on Slide 4. In the second quarter, we launched our automotive solutions on 20 different vehicles across 10 OEMs, including Ford, General Motors, Great Wall, Hyundai and Toyota. We continue to see tremendous momentum for our CCS solutions. In the second quarter, our CCS solutions were launched on the Buick LaCrosse, Buick E4 EV, Chevrolet Blazer EV, Ford Mustang, Hyundai Verna as well as several EV models of Great Wall vehicles in China, including the Tank 700, the plug-in hybrid, Blue Mountain SUV and Haval Xiaolong Max. Now let me give you a quick update on ClimateSense. We are progressing well in preparing for the flawless launch of the two upcoming production programs with General Motors, and in addition, we continue to work on several development projects with OEMs around the world, including recent work with a few electric vehicle manufacturers. The demonstrations of range extension enabled by ClimateSense have also driven higher thermal content, higher take rates and adoption on electric vehicles, which have resulted in a significant number of awards in the quarter. In addition to ClimateSense, our advanced engineering team continues to integrate thermal with lumbar and massage to create innovative full system solutions. The combination of heating and cooling the body with our proprietary pulsating massage is opening vast opportunities for health and wellness experiences, alertness enhancements and physical recovery in the car. We are perfectly positioned to be a major player in the software-defined vehicle of the future by integrating our proprietary software and algorithms. Our Alfmeier integration continues to deliver more value for our customers. We are now the clear market and technology leader in thermal and pneumatic lumbar and massage solutions. Our strong position as the largest independent provider is a powerful differentiator with our customers. We are actively engaged with OEMs and Tier 1 seat manufacturers in North America, Europe and Asia to collaborate on breakthrough integrated comfort solutions.These solutions provide industry-leading comfort performance, reduced space requirements in the seat and the interior, less weight and the significant improvement in seat assembly efficiency through reduced complexity. As a partner to over 25 seat manufacturers around the world, our scale and capabilities are unparalleled. As the leading innovator in this market, we can collaborate with our customers to create customized solutions and leverage Gentherm scalable platform across multiple customers. Also, our engineers are simply the world experts in integration as we work with nearly every car manufacturer and every seat maker and configuration. We believe our partnership model is a unique and sustainable competitive advantage. Now on Slide 5, where we'll discuss our record awards. While the pipeline of pneumatic opportunities remain very strong, the majority of the new awards secured in the second quarter were for Thermal Solutions, where we had a truly breakthrough quarter. We won CCS awards on the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV; Ford Explorer EV, Ford F-150 Lightning EV, Kia EV9 and the Subaru Forester. We continue to gain momentum in China. We won CCS awards for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, several Great Wall plug-in hybrid models, Honda CRV and Lee Auto's electric MPV. Of special note, we won our second Climate Control Seat award with the world's largest EV manufacturer by volume BYD, for its popular Song EV. Importantly, we won a highly desirable and contested award with BMW. Our CCS solutions will be on the next-generation electric and ICE X Series SUVs, including the X5, X6, X7 and the iX5, iX6 and iX7. In fact, the new BMW X7 and iX7 will also feature Gentherm's Active CCS solution. In the second quarter, we also received 11 steering wheel heater awards across 7 OEMs. These included bright drop bands from General Motors, Honda Ridgeline, Nissan Murano and the Renault Megane. In addition, we won hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heater awards for several Changan EV models in China. If you recall, we had an extremely strong pneumatic comfort wins in the first quarter including breakthrough conquest wins with Jaguar, Land Rover and General Motors. In the second quarter, we won a pneumatic lumbar award for the Audi A4. In addition, I'd like to congratulate our team in China for winning a combined thermal comfort, lumbar and massage full system award for the Volkswagen Lamando EV. Further validating the value proposition of the combined technologies of Gentherm and the acquired Alfmeier. The momentum of pneumatic lumbar and massage awards is accelerating rapidly. And I am pleased to share that we just won in July our first lumbar and massage award with Stallantis, on the Jeep Compass, Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Alfa Romeo Giulia and Maserati Levante. This conquest award was enabled by Gentherm's strong customer relationships and Alfmeier's industry-leading technologies. Let me remind you that we have already won 6 Conquest pneumatic lumbar and massage awards, since the close of the acquisition, and we are well ahead of our revenue synergy plans. Now on to Battery Performance Solutions. In the second quarter, we won an Air Cooling Battery Thermal Management award for Hyundai across 6 electrified vehicle platforms. With this award, we will be cooling 80% of Hyundai's mild hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicle batteries. So in summary, our record awards in the second quarter are strong proof points of our ability to grow market share through conquest wins as well as growing penetration of thermal and pneumatic comfort solutions. Now let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of our medical business. As a result of continued financial pressures and muted capital spending at hospitals in the United States, and a large onetime order by the United Nations in the second quarter of last year, we saw a reduction in medical revenue in the quarter. Given the change in the purchasing behaviors in the metal device space post-COVID, we are working on bold moves to adapt our medical go-to-market model to leverage large partnerships, distribution and white label opportunities. Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that we are strengthening our partnership with SourceMark Medical, a certified minority supplier headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, to provide world-class patient warming solutions to the U.S. health care market. Source Mark has a proven track record of driving growth by providing superior service and solutions to hospitals and medical providers.With this partnership, we expect to significantly increase our ability to win business with our patient warming solutions. With the successful integration of Dacheng Medical, we continue to win new accounts and hospitals in China. In the second quarter, we added 24 new hospital accounts in China, replacing competition. And in the U.S., we added more units to the existing fleet of Blanketrol III systems at the Boston Children's Hospital to support expanded usage. In addition, we were awarded the Blanketrol III and Kool-Kit business at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, a brand-new hospital. We are confident that these actions will help us accelerate our growth in the patient temperature management solutions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matteo for a little more color on the financial results.Matteo AnversaThank you, Phil. Let me turn to Slide 7 and focus on the most significant items in our second quarter results. So for the quarter, total revenues increased by 43% compared to the same period of last year, including the contribution from the acquisitions.If we adjust for the impact of acquisitions and FX, our overall product revenue increased by 18%. Starting with the Automotive segment. Automotive revenues were $362 million, reflecting a 45% increase compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for the $65 million contributing from Alfmeier and foreign currency translation, Automotive revenues increased by 19%, and this compares to an 18% increase in the actual light vehicle production in our key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. We outperformed the light vehicle production volume by over a 100 basis points. Excluding the nonautomotive electronics business, which we are in the process of phasing out and last year's onetime benefit from spot by recoveries we outperformed production volume by nearly 400 basis points in the quarter, over 600 basis points year-to-date. We saw significant growth in the majority of our product lines and more specifically, steering wheel heaters revenue increased by 35% compared to the prior year period due to higher demand and production volume on multiple GM platforms and a major Global EV OEM as well as increased content on VW as a result of our hands-on detection-enabled steering wheel heater. CCS revenue increased by 26% due to higher production volume of GM trucks and SUVs as well as higher take rate on several models with Hyundai Kia, JLR, Honda, BMW and Ford. Lumbar and massage revenue increased 20% on a pro forma basis due to the ramp-up of several platforms on BMW, Mercedes and VW as well as higher production volume with a major global EV OEM. Seat heater revenue increased by 19% due to higher production volume of trucks and SUVs at GM. Increased take rate with Ford as well as increased content on the KIA Telluride as a result of the second row adoption. BPS revenue increased 12% due to higher volume with Mercedes, General Motors and the start of production of our proprietary thin foil cell connecting board on the BMW 7 Series plug-in hybrid. Cable revenues increased 5% due to higher sales with VW, Hyundai, Kia and Ford. Bulk Systems revenue increased 3% on a pro forma basis due to higher production volume in China, and electronics revenue decreased 9% due to the phaseout of nonautomotive electronics. Turning to Medical. Medical revenues decreased 7%, primarily as a result of lower demand in the U.S. and Asia as well as the large onetime order in the prior-year period in Europe that Phil mentioned earlier. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $42.4 million up from $24.8 million in the prior year period and $26.1 million in the prior year pro forma. The adjusted EBITDA rate in the second quarter was 11.4%, and this compares to 8.2% in the year ago period on a comparable pro forma basis. The 320 basis points year-over-year improvement was driven by fixed cost leverage on higher sales volume, inflationary customer price adjustments, productivity at the factories and lower freight costs. These were partially offset by material and wage inflation and the negative impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Chinese RMB and the Korean Yuan. It is worth noting that excluding the impact of the Alfmeier acquisition, legacy Gentherm adjusted EBITDA margin rate rose to 13% over the 9.5% recorded in the prior year quarter on a comparable basis, corresponding to a 350 basis point improvement year-over-year. Operating expenses were $83.7 million in the quarter compared to $51.6 million in the prior year period. If we adjust for acquisition, integration and restructuring costs as well as noncash stock compensation expenses and the noncash goodwill impairment in both periods, operating expenses were $58.6 million, up from $44.1 million in the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase of approximately $40 million was primarily driven by the additional expenses from the acquired businesses as well as higher compensation expenses and lower reimbursement of R&amp;D costs on an organic basis. It is worth noting that adjusted operating expense as a percentage of revenue improved 100 basis points year-over-year. Now during the second quarter, Medical did not perform in line with the forecasted results, driven primarily by it's lower-than-anticipated revenue growth, both in the core business and in Dacheng. As a result, an indicator of impairment was identified and an interim quantitative assessment was performed and the results of this assessment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value. As we outlined in the press release earlier this morning, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge in our medical business of $19.5 million or $0.52 per share after tax, to align the reporting unit's book value with its fair value. Excluding the impact of this noncash goodwill impairment charge, our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 32%, in line with the prior quarter. And finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.58 per share compared to $0.25 per share in the second quarter of last year. Now moving to the balance sheet on Slide 8. Our cash position at the end of the quarter was approximately $169 million. During the quarter, we reduced our net debt to $49 million from $68 million at the end of March, primarily due to strong cash generation from operating activities. As a result, our net leverage ratio was 0.3 at the end of the second quarter, down from 0.5 at the end of March and well below our target of 1.5x. Based on the trailing 12-month consolidated adjusted EBITDA ended June 30, we had approximately $283 million of remaining availability on our line of credit. And the total available liquidity as of June 30 was $451 million, up from $433 million at the end of March. Now let me turn to Slide 9 for our 2023 guidance. As we did in the last earnings call, for comparison purposes, we included the actual results as reported for 2022 as well as the pro forma 2022 values if we had incorporated the results of Alfmeier, since the beginning of the year. We are maintaining our 2023 guidance as discussed in the prior earnings call. For 2023, we are expecting revenue to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, assuming FX remains at the current levels and light vehicle production in our relevant market grows at a mid-single-digit rate in 2023 versus 2022. The point of our guidance implies a growth rate of 11% on a pro forma basis, and we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margin rate to be in the range of 11.5% to 13.5% for 2023. We still expect our adjusted full year effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment to be in the range of 28% to 32%. And capital expenditures to be on the lower end of the guided range of $60 million to $70 million. So with that, I will turn the call back to Phil.Phillip M. EylerThanks, Matteo. Now let me summarize. I'm proud of the global Gentherm team for continued strong momentum in winning awards, delivering record revenue and expanding profitability.In the second quarter, we secured a record $670 million in new automotive business awards, bringing us to nearly $1.2 billion in the first half. Leveraging Alfmeier's industry leading technologies and Gentherm's strong customer relationships, we have won 6 conquest pneumatic lumbar and massage awards, since the close of the acquisition, including a breakthrough award from Stellantis in July. We're investing in two new manufacturing plants and implementing our Fit for Growth 2.0 initiatives to deliver a high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin rate by 2026. The momentum on revenue and awards, combined with the steps we're taking to optimize our footprint and cost structure will drive Gentherm's flywheel of profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionOperatorThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ryan Sigdahl with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.Ryan Ronald SigdahlMaybe we'll just start with Medical and then we'll move over to Auto. But given the challenges there, does it make sense to operate that business given kind of post-COVID changes and given it's becoming increasingly small relative to the Auto business with Alfmeier and all the traction you have there?Phillip M. EylerWell, we think so. We certainly continue -- we just don't link it back to the automotive business. Remember, one of the huge value propositions for us is that through our medical business, we developed strong skills in the science of thermophysiology, which ties right back to our climate sense development.So those synergies back to automotive are getting stronger and stronger. No doubt that, at least for the moment, the med device industry, especially related to hospital financial struggles is stressed. And that's what we've been dealing with for the last several quarters. But we really believe we have a plan to grow that business and to make it accretive for the company. And one of the adoptions that we're making -- that we're working on making right now is to kind of pivot, especially in North America market to partnering with some of the large players that can open up the doors in the hospitals for us to move our product, which has been very difficult post-COVID. And one of those we announced was the partnership with SourceMark. I've been personally involved with that team at SourceMark, and they have very established relationships with the GPOs and the hospitals, and I think that's going to accelerate our growth. We have great product our teams in automotive and medical are collaborating very well. So I still feel pretty good about our road map.Ryan Ronald SigdahlWe'll move over to Auto. A couple of questions there. So congrats on the breakthrough Lumbar and Massage Award with Stellantis. Curious what model you or when that starts -- will start to impact the financials and the shipments start there? And then secondly, how much additional opportunity do you think there is to expand beyond those initial models?Phillip M. EylerYes. I think, that was a huge win. I believe it's Model 26 that it would launch. But any time you win a first platform with a new customer, it's your opportunity to prove yourself and to scale across other platforms within the customer. So certainly, that's the way we are viewing this. And our job now is to go execute in a world-class way.Ryan Ronald SigdahlAnd then on all the new CCS EV awards, a lot of the trucks, SUVs with your core customers, good to see that expansion. I guess, curious, is that heat-cool, heat-vent, curious of the content kind of going into EVs and the tier lower than kind of other core CCS platforms with those OEMs? And then I'll maybe stop there. Then one more.Phillip M. EylerYes. I mean, first of all, we are so excited about the win rate of CCS. And I think it shows by some of the announcements that we're making on and which vehicles. The content is high. The take rates are high. Clearly showing that our technology is going to make a difference for EV manufacturers. And as we called out, the many, many collaborations and partnerships that we've done on ClimateSense have really opened the door for us to show the value of not only ClimateSense, but CCS in terms of power consumption savings and range extension.So we're really excited about that. We announced a specific CCS active product on the X7 and iX7. But for the most part, we're still seeing vent, ventilated CCS as the primary technology.Ryan Ronald SigdahlGreat. Last one for me, just on the industry help production. So even if you adjust for the various FX and Alfmeier and the onetime, kind of the spot purchases last year. I mean 400 bps of op performance, you guys have been trending quite a bit better than that. You had award kind of book-to-bill a lot higher in the past several years. I guess curious if there's anything else in the quarter to call out because there was a little bit of a decel?Phillip M. EylerYes, we kind of look at it as 400 basis points of outperformance year-to-date 600. And essentially, most things happened as expected. The one thing that was an anomaly was related to a couple of Japanese OEM customers. We have fact 2 that had some pretty significant production downtime for various reasons. And then there's a couple of vehicles that are ICE sedans that last year we had some pretty high content, they're changing out those vehicles. So it's a little bit of a time issue. We expect all that to normalize and expect to continue our outperformance trends.Ryan Ronald SigdahlThanks, Phil. Good luck guys.OperatorOur next question comes from Glenn Chin with Seaport Research Partners.Glenn Edward ChinGood morning, folks. Thank you. I have a couple more follow-up -- got of a couple of follow-up questions on bookings. See, you mentioned that you've had 6 conquest pneumatic and lumber awards, since the acquisition. I don't recall the exact wording in the press release, but it seemed to allude that there are revenue synergistic, meaning that they would have been less likely to happen with Alfmeier on its own. Can you confirm that? Is that -- is my reading of that word incorrect?Phillip M. EylerYes. I think you stated it perfectly.Glenn Edward ChinOkay. Very good. And I think you said that the majority of the bookings were thermal comfort wins versus pneumatic. Can you give us the split between the two this quarter as well as last quarter?Phillip M. EylerNo, we haven't been splitting that, but definitely, this quarter was the majority thermal. And we were actually really excited about that because the pipeline of pneumatic awards is really strong. We pointed out that the Stellantis win was in July, so it was outside of the quarter. A lot of opportunities in the back half on the pneumatic side as well. But the confidence I have on our thermal business and the partnership model that we've created is very high.We are the largest independent supplier in the space. We can work with any OEM, any Tier 1 seat manufacturer, and I think that is really picking up momentum.Glenn Edward ChinYes. Good to hear. And just a clarification on the breakthrough nature of the Stellantis win -- so is that to say that they were not an Alfmeier and pneumatic customer prior to this?Phillip M. EylerThat's right. They've never supplied to Stellantis and pneumatics, yes.Glenn Edward ChinYes. Okay. Very good. An can you just talk to us about your win rate? Has it been -- I know it's been elevated. Has it moved up or down significantly?Phillip M. EylerContinues to be very strong. I think you can look at a lot of the nameplates that we're winning and many of those are head-to-head competitive wins. So it's a very strong win rate.Glenn Edward ChinYes. It seems to run the gamut. Okay. And then last question. So one of your competitors this morning in the earnings release -- in their press release, it seems like they're attempting to encourage upon ClimateSense's turf. They say that they've agreed with Valeo to explore integration of HVAC and Radiant Panel Technologies with (inaudible) thermal comfort seating technologies to optimize this ""occupant comfort and user experience"" by extending EV range. Any thing you can tell us about values capabilities there. I wasn't aware that they had?Phillip M. EylerYes, sure. Well, I think it's the best thing for me to do is talk about our strategy and go-to-market model with ClimateSense. First of all, as you know, we've developed our own ClimateSense software and algorithm that can control the microclimate of every position in the vehicle. And that is done by integrating our software with any HVAC controller on the market. And we've developed our software that has an easy API, one platform that can be integrated with any HVAC system. I think it's really important, and we've obviously have -- have been worked with almost every OEM around the world. And it's important to understand the dynamics of HVAC as it stands today. OEMs by and large, the book in-house their own HVAC controls, and their own HVAC algorithms and software. Our ClimateSense integrates with the OEMs developed software and algorithms. They also architect their own HVAC systems for the most part, and basically purchase the individual modules and components create that integrated system in the car. So our model has been to work directly with the OEMs and I believe that's the right model for us. It's paid off so far. So that's kind of where we're at. We have all of our own proprietary thermal effectors, including Radiant panels in-house. So I think we're really well positioned. That said, we're as OEMs desire, we're happy to work with anybody. We can partner with anybody. And that's been our model, that kind of open partnership model, and we're excited about that moving forward.Glenn Edward ChinAnd I know in the past, you've talked about -- a lot about the software component of the ClimateSense System. Is it fair to say that is the I don't know, for lack of a better term, the secret sauce so to speak?Phillip M. EylerDefinitely, definitely. Well, we certainly believe we have next-generation innovation on all of our devices. But the ClimateSense software is, it's the heart of climate sense. And it can be employed on a full system, where you have all the components in the vehicle, plus you're controlling the interface with the HVAC software. But it could also, as you recall, we've also set up a more scalable model, where we've integrated the ClimateSense software into smart devices.So essentially, the smart CCS or the smart heat, smart neck conditioning, smart radiant panels. Those can all on their own integrate with an HVAC control architecture. So we have a really ability to scale ClimateSense in any way that helps an OEM. I think that's really been appreciated by the OEMs, and we expect to see continued momentum.Glenn Edward ChinYes. And can you clarify, Phil, is the software in ClimateSense patent protected?Phillip M. EylerYes.Glenn Edward ChinOkay. Very good. That's it for me.OperatorOur next question comes from Matt Koranda with ROTH MKM.Matthew Butler KorandaSo just a few have been answered, but I wanted to kind of focus in on the outlook for the year that you guys provided. So there's, I think, a decent amount of outperformance versus industry production implied in the second half outlook. So just wondering if you could maybe call out is there a pickup in take rate or just vehicle mix that you're seeing in the releases that you've got from customers that you can call out to give us a little bit more confidence in the back half numbers?Phillip M. EylerSure. New launches is going to be one of the heavy drivers for us. We've got a lot of those queued up for the second half. We expect some recovery. We talked about the Japanese OEMs, those we don't see persisting in the second half. And those are the primary drivers, and we have clear visibility in our -- with our releases. So that's what created the forecast.Matthew Butler KorandaOkay. Fair enough. And then on the margins for the back half, I think, you've got to be kind of north of 13% to hit the midpoint of your EBITDA margin guide. So maybe Matteo, if you could bridge us from the first half performance, which I think was in the middle of it and into that kind of mid-13% range. How do we get there? What are the big elements and levers of improvement? Maybe I mean, whether you want to do that via some of the buckets that you called out in gross margin in the release or core Gentherm margins versus Alfmeier, I'll let you take your pick on that.Matteo AnversaYes. Sure. I'll do it both ways. So you're right. The first half was about 11.5%. We need, in order to hit the midpoint, we need the second half to come in at about 13.5%. So you have a 200 basis point lift sequentially. And there are really 3 drivers. One is volume, so that would give us, as we are expecting revenue in the second half to be a little higher than the first half will give us a lift of about 100 basis points. The second aspect is Alfmeier, Alfmeier has been running in the first half of the year at the low single-digit EBITDA rate. We're expecting to hit mid-single digit by the end of the year. So you're going to have a lift on the Alfmeier rate. And that's fundamentally driven by further acceleration on the price recoveries, where Alfmeier has been a little bit behind compared to the legacy Gentherm business.So that's about 40 bps of expansion sequentially. The rest will come through sourcing savings. As you know, most of the sourcing savings, particularly around rebates tend to come later in the year as well as a little bit of a further improvement in productivity of the plants in the legacy Gentherm business. So [as I here in the walk]. One, I think, important thing to note particularly as it pertains to the revenue, is that the current outlook that we provided this morning does not assume any impact of a potential UAW strike, which clearly is on the norm right now.Matthew Butler KorandaOkay. That's great. And very clear on the breakouts there. And then I guess just the last one wanted to address was the plant expansion in Morocco and Mexico. Maybe just speak to the capabilities in their facilities, what that provides you? Why the footprint expansion? And then just in terms of the -- it sounded like you said you're going to be on the lower end of your CapEx guide? Does your CapEx outlook for this year and incorporate costs from those new plants? And then maybe just if you could address total cost in terms of expansion there.Matteo AnversaSo let me maybe address the CapEx question first, then Phil, you can address the rest. So CapEx in the first half is about $14 million, which is about a even split between maintenance and growth. We are expecting the second half to be in the range of about $35 million, $40 million. And that includes a little bit of CapEx for continuing to build in some contingency relate to Ukraine and then a $5 million to $10 million CapEx related to the expansion that you just talked about. And then the rest is really primarily split between growth to fund the new programs that we won and a little bit of maintenance. So that's kind of what we are seeing on the CapEx.Phillip M. EylerMatt, I'll just talk about the plants. First of all, we've done an extensive search for the appropriate location, and we're very excited about expanding our footprint in Morocco and Monterrey for multiple reasons. And what's really driving it, to be honest, is just growth. We've got our record awards within a couple of years, we're going to outstrip our manufacturing capacity around the world. We have to do it. There's no real choice. And the other side benefit to expanding in these locations is going to give us a lot more flexibility to optimize our footprint and how we manage our high labor content production in the most cost-effective way. So we believe not only this is going to allow us to reach the growth in front of us, but also to drive our gross margin improvement.Matthew Butler KorandaOkay. Excellent. I'll leave it there guys. I appreciate it.OperatorOur next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird.Luke L. JunkJust two for me this morning. Phil. For starters, I was just hoping you could discuss some of your puts and takes in terms of maintaining the sales guidance, I think you're now expecting mid-single digit production growth versus low-single digit previously, but we also know there are some risks in the second half in terms of macro and whatnot. Just wondering what the offset is that's leaving your guidance unchanged and then just low end versus high end, how you're thinking about that range of expectations sitting here midyear on the top line?Phillip M. EylerYes. I mean we -- first of all, we do it bottoms up. So we're looking at all the releases from our customers, the vehicle launches, the timing. It's a very precise process that we go through as we're putting it together. Of course, in some ways, by vehicle, we'll have to look at the S&amp;P forecast that's provided. But frankly, this is a bottom-up build. And this is the way -- this is what's leading to the overall plan.Luke L. JunkOkay. Fair enough. And then for my follow-up, just hoping in bigger picture, you could just expand on what you're seeing in the Chinese market more broadly right now, especially is animated by your bookings? We know there are some competing forces there, [namely] I'm thinking, the desire by some Chinese OEMs to keep things in-house versus the drive to include more tech and comfort features in the car, which you can obviously help with. Just where do you see that pendulum today and then reflected in the conversations that you've had this year with those customers?Phillip M. EylerWell, obviously, the rate at which EVs are coming out in China is very high, and I think that's pretty clear on our part by the announcements that we made. And along with that, there's two things -- two dynamics happening with the EVs in the space. Number 1 is it's very competitive to grab the attention of consumers. And so the OEMs are desiring to add more features to differentiate their offering. And obviously, the thermal comfort, lumbar massage comfort are the things that help OEMs differentiate. The other thing is that, clearly, we're doing the best we can, and I think a really good job of communicating the power consumption savings of our thermal products in the car, and believe that's also having a good impact on the win rate. We have a very strong footprint in China, both from a product development side, sales side, customer management side and of course, production. So it's a very localized business model. China moves at an incredible pace, and you have to be there responding 24 hours a day basically to be successful. And I'm really proud of our team. We have just an awesome team in China that is competing hard and winning in that market.OperatorThat concludes our Q&amp;A session in today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a good day.]"

Some 2013 Chevrolet Trax versions in Canada also are included.The company says in documents posted Tuesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the driver's front air bag inflator can explode in a crash due to a manufacturing defect.The inflators are among a group made by Takata that is under investigation by the agency but has not previously been recalled.Takata used volatile ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can deteriorate over time and explode with too much force, blowing apart a metal canister and spewing shrapnel.At least 26 people have been killed in the U.S. by the inflators since May of 2009, and more than 30 have died worldwide including people in Malaysia and Australia. In addition, about 400 people have been injured.Potential for the dangerous malfunction led to the largest series of auto recalls in U.S. history, with at least 67 million Takata inflators involved. The U.S. government says that millions have not been repaired. About 100 million inflators have been recalled worldwide. The exploding air bags sent Takata Corp. of Japan into bankruptcy.The air bags in the General Motors recall have a moisture-absorbing chemical called a dessicant and were not part of previous recalls. GM says in documents posted by the government that the problem is limited to a specific lot of inflators made by Takata, and that other vehicles are not affected.But Takata air bags with a dessicant are under investigation by NHTSA because they have the potential to explode and expel shrapnel. The investigation opened in 2021 covers more than 30 million inflators in over 200 models from 20 car and truck makers, including GM.Story continuesThe agency decided in May of 2020 not to recall the inflators with the dessicant, but said it would monitor them.“While no present safety risk has been identified, further work is needed to evaluate the future risk of non-recalled dessicated inflators,” the agency said in a document opening the probe.GM says in documents that it was notified in March that an inflator exploded in a 2013 Camaro in Brazil in May of 2022. The company says an analysis of the inflator is still under way, but initial findings indicate the inflator rupture is related to a manufacturing defect and was not caused by deterioration of the ammonium nitrate.Spokesman Bill Grotz said one person was injured in the Camaro in Brazil, but the company has no other reports of this type of inflator rupturing or hurting anyone else. “GM is taking this field action out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of our customers as our highest priority,” Grotz said. He said he couldn't give details of the manufacturing defect.In a statement, NHTSA said the agency doesn't have any data suggesting that other dessicated Takata inflators might rupture. “GM’s analysis is still ongoing and we are in communication with them regarding their findings,” the statement said.Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said GM and NHTSA are leaving drivers to worry about what air bag inflators their vehicles have and whether they are safe to drive. “It's kind of absurd that we're left in the dark about what's in our vehicles due to confidentiality provisions” granted to automakers, Brooks said.NHTSA, he said, should play a larger role in reassuring consumers that this is a manufacturing defect and that their vehicles are safe. “There needs to be some sort of showing or some sort of demonstration that can make consumers feel confident that they're not going to encounter the problem, and we're not getting that,” he said.]"

The hike was widely expected as the Fed believes that inflation is still elevated and has remained open for more hikes depending on economic data in the near term.Inflation has been cooling steadily over the past 12 months, raising hope among market participants that the Fed will soon end its current monetary tightening cycle. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined to 3% in June after rising 4% in May. Understandably, CPI has fallen considerably after peaking to 9.1% in June 2022.According to the latest data from the Commerce Department, Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation and the core PCE inflation rose by 2.6% and 3.8%, respectively, in the second quarter. The figures hint at cooling inflation compared to an increase of 4.1% for PCE and 4.9% for core PCE in the first quarter.The headline PCE inflation also increased just 3% in June on a year-over-year basis, to hit its lowest level since March 2021. Moreover, U.S. GDP grew an impressive 2.4% in the second quarter, following a rise of 2% in the first quarter.The picture is rosy but the Fed remains concerned as inflation is far from its target range of 2%. The Fed has increased interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take the federal funds rate to 5.25-5.50%, marking the highest level since March 2001.Although central bank officials are confident that the economy may now have a softer landing as inflation continues to ease, it believes that more interest rate hikes are required to get full control over the economy’s health.Moreover, the Fed believes that the economy is still holding strong as the labor market remains resilient. Job creation has slowed but the U.S. economy added 290,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate is still quite low at 3.6%.Hence, the crisis is far from over and the Fed may go for more interest rate hikes. Interest rate hikes can be detrimental to the economy amid the looming risk of a recession. They impact consumer spending habits, increase borrowing expenses, and impede overall economic growth.Story continuesMoreover, given this situation, the first interest rate cut is not expected before 2025, although some market participants speculate it might occur in 2024.Investors should thus focus on stocks that offer risk-adjusted returns like Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB, McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, J&amp;J Snack Foods Corp.

265,63ca4833-a673-30a7-a3ef-dbbffbe171f0,MKC,2023-08-02,‘Set It and Forget It’ With These 3 Stocks to Buy,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/set-forget-3-stocks-buy-033545026.html,1690428945,STORY,"['JNJ', 'MKC-V', 'BF-B']","[Investing can be complicated. That’s especially true when putting money to work in fast-moving industries with rapidly changing product cycles. Sometimes, it’s nice to own long-term stocks that are good choices to buy and hold indefinitely. This has led to the rise of long-term stocks to buy.These three picks are companies that have been in business for more than a century and are still going strong. By selling products that never go out of style, these firms tend to be resilient against both recessions and technological change. No investment comes without risk, but these three long-term stocks are among the most high-quality conservative holdings out there for investors that want to “set it and forget it”.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)An image of Neutrogena products stocked on a shelfSource: Faizal Ramli/Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a core holding for many long-term investors. And with good reason. It’s a perfect example of an easy-maintenance stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJohnson &amp; Johnson has been in business since 1886 and nowadays sells an astounding array of products across the pharmaceutical and medical device spaces.Johnson &amp; Johnson has a decentralized organizational structure, with lower-level product managers and engineers getting a surprising amount of autonomy in decision-making. This has allowed J&amp;J to continue to innovate and grow despite its massive size.The company recently spun off its Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) consumer products business. This gives Johnson &amp; Johnson greater exposure to its existing businesses with higher growth prospects. After a sluggish 2022, J&amp;J delivered excellent earnings this month, with its medical devices for surgeries unit showing particularly strong results.McCormick (MKC)Retail workers checking produce at a grocery store.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comMcCormick (NYSE:MKC) is the dominant player in the U.S. spices and seasonings market.It has an estimated 40-60% market share in its primary categories, coming in at more than double that of its nearest branded competitor. It also is a leading provider of spices for store brands. This creates the situation where consumers are often choosing between a McCormick spice and a generic alternative that McCormick also produces.Story continuesHaving a quasi-monopoly on basic cooking ingredients makes for a good business. McCormick shares are up more than 8,000% over the past 40 years. McCormick’s vast supply chain and sourcing advantages are hard to compete with.In recent years, McCormick has been broadening its reach. It now has a leading position in producing flavors and seasonings for restaurants and institutional kitchens. Furthermore, McCormick is making deals, such as its acquisitions including Frank’s and Cholula in the hot sauce space.Long story short, spices and seasonings are nearly impossible to disrupt. Humans love tasty food and unique flavors. Sales should continue to grow as people demand more interesting flavors, along with benefitting from McCormick’s moves into additional product categories and various international markets.Brown-Forman (BF.A)A photo of four people holding glasses with cocktails in them out in a toast, over a wooden table.Source: Cabeca de Marmore/ShutterStock.comLike spices, spirits are another thing that never goes out of style. Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF-A) (NYSE:BF-B) was founded in 1870. Remarkably enough, the Jack Daniels producer even managed to stay in business during the United States’ period of alcohol prohibition.Brown-Forman’s long-term stock appeal is strong. People tend to be pretty set on their choices in alcoholic beverages. Jack Daniels is a resonant brand that has proven to hold weight with many generations of Americans over the decades. Increasingly, Jack Daniels is a global phenomenon as well, with Brown-Forman investing heavily in Latin America and other emerging markets to spread its reach.In recent years, the company has branched out into other spirits as well, with its Casa Herradura tequila acquisition in 2007 looking particularly shrewd. Tequila has gone on to become a fast-growing spirit in the North American market, and one where premium and super-premium products are now gaining appeal.The final element for the long-term story is ownership. The Brown family continues to control the company via ownership of the A-class shares which have voting rights. This protects the firm from outside suitors and allows it to continue compounding wealth for its shareholders on a generational level.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BF-A, MKC, JNJ stock.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after investigating Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Intuitive Surgical is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$14b - US$1.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 13%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 8.9% it's much better. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceIn the above chart we have measured Intuitive Surgical's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Intuitive Surgical.So How Is Intuitive Surgical's ROCE Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Intuitive Surgical doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 20% over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Intuitive Surgical's ROCEWhile returns have fallen for Intuitive Surgical in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. Furthermore the stock has climbed 88% over the last five years, it would appear that investors are upbeat about the future. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.If you're still interested in Intuitive Surgical it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While Intuitive Surgical may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

(computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.In order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company’s operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.BOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.PORTFOLIO LEASING PERCENTAGES% Occupied by Location (1)% Leased by Location (2)June 30, 2023December 31, 2022June 30, 2023December 31, 2022Boston90.7 %90.2 %92.1 %92.7 %Los Angeles86.0 %88.3 %86.2 %88.6 %New York88.5 %86.8 %90.6 %90.9 %San Francisco88.2 %88.5 %89.1 %88.8 %Seattle87.9 %88.3 %90.5 %90.9 %Washington, DC84.9 %88.7 %89.2 %93.0 %Total Portfolio88.3 %88.6 %90.4 %91.5 %(1)Represents signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP.(2)Represents signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP and signed leases for vacant space with future commencement dates.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230801323245/en/ContactsAT BXP Michael LaBelleExecutive Vice President,Chief Financial Officer and Treasurermlabelle@bxp.comHelen HanVice President, Investor Relationshhan@bxp.com]"

Rendering: Boston PropertiesChef James Kent, owner of Michelin-starred restaurants Crown Shy and Saga, plans to open his first restaurant outside of the Financial District in Midtown South. Kent’s SAGA Hospitality cooked up a 10-year deal with Boston Properties (BXP) for 7,000 square feet at 360 Park Avenue South. The New York Post first reported the restaurant deal. The unnamed restaurant — which will accommodate 130 people — will serve coffee and pastries during the day and seafood at night, and plans to open in 2024, Kent and Boston Properties told Commercial Observer.James Kent. Photo: Kelt TKent is still busy workshopping the menu, but he wrote in an email that he is currently most excited about “the idea of adapting Grand Central Oyster Bar’s iconic oyster pan roast” for his new eatery.The chef became famous for Crown Shy, Saga and cocktail bar Overstory — ranked as one of the world’s top 50 bars — all located at 70 Pine Street in the Financial District. While those restaurants may be well known, “they’re part of a single ecosystem,” Kent wrote in an email. This new location is an “opportunity for us to spread our wings a bit.”Kent spent the formative years of his career as a chef working at Eleven Madison Park, first starting as a line cook, then a sous chef and finally chef de cuisine, so he said he’s looking forward to returning to that area near Madison Square Park. “This feels like a homecoming,” Kent said. For his first venture outside of the Financial District, Kent landed on Boston Properties’ 450,000-square-foot tower that it bought from Empire Asset Management at the end of 2021 for $300 million, as CO previously reported.Boston Properties is in the process of redeveloping and modernizing the 20-story Park Avenue building, with plans to add a conference center, communal rooftop, lounges, private work areas and a ground-floor bike valet, according to the landlord. It’s unclear who brokered the deal.Leah Breakstone can be reached at lbreakstone@commercialobserver.com.Story continuesTrending Commercial Observer StoriesQueens Hotel Sells at Massive Loss After Conversion to Migrant ShelterFortress Makes $1B Bet on NYC Office Rebound With Capital One Loan Portfolio BuyNYC’s Return to Office Outpaces Much of the US, but Midtown Still StrugglesNew York Investor Buys Spice Lab Warehouse in Pompano Beach for $24MFlorida’s Favorite LenderRead the original story Crown Shy Chef James Kent Opening New Seafood Restaurant in Midtown South and others by Leah Breakstone at Commercial Observer.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Class I railroads BNSF and CSX have announced agreements with key labor groups: BNSF reached a sick leave and work-rest agreement with the union representing locomotive engineers, while CSX and the union representing conductors partnered to enhance CSX’s training program for conductors.BNSF strikes sick leave and work-rest agreement with BLETWestern U.S. rail carrier BNSF has reached a systemwide agreement for sick leave with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), the railway announced Tuesday.The tentative agreement, which will affect 7,500 BLET members, also addresses scheduled time off.The sick leave portion calls for up to eight days of paid sick leave, while the scheduling option introduces work-rest options that BNSF says can be implemented in groups or pools throughout BNSF’s network. Locomotive engineers will have an opportunity to receive an “earned day off” quarterly on top of individual paid sick days, BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B) said.“This breakthrough tentative agreement comes after several months of negotiations, and pending ratification by BLET’s members at BNSF, it is expected to bring positive changes to both the professional and personal lives of locomotive engineers,” BNSF said in a Tuesday release. “The agreement will allow for more predictable scheduling and enable engineers to take paid sick leave without any penalty. These enhancements will not only contribute to a more consistent service for BNSF’s customers but also aid in the recruitment and retention of employees.”BLET members are expected to hold a vote in September on ratifying the agreement.“The cooperation between BLET and BNSF marks an important step forward in supporting the well-being and satisfaction of locomotive engineers, ensuring a more balanced and efficient work environment,” BNSF said.CSX and SMART-TD work on conductor trainee programCSX and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers — Transportation Division (SMART-TD) are working together to enhance the conductor trainee program at CSX by adding an extra week to the program.Story continuesExtending the program from four weeks to five will provide additional hands-on experience by having trainees focus on performing tasks in a field setting to increase their exposure to railcar switching scenarios, radio communication, securement of equipment, brake tests and other fundamentals of the conductor’s role, the railroad and the union said Monday. Hands-on training begins in the third week, but the extra week of training at CSX’s training center in Atlanta will reinforce trainees’ comfort level as they operate on first and second shifts, they said.After conductor trainees complete their training, they start on-the-job training for up to five months at their hiring locations. That on-site training provides conductors opportunities to learn about the physical characteristics and the job assignments of their designated territory.“Training is the foundation of the CSX safety culture, and investing in employees is the most fundamental way we can prepare our train crew members for a safe, successful career on the railroad,” Jamie Boychuk, CSX executive vice president of operations, said in a Monday release. “The additional week of new-hire training in Atlanta will help conductors strengthen their skills in preparation for their on-the-job training assignment.”CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) said it consulted with SMART-TD to develop the extended training program.“We’re proud to continue working with CSX to improve the training curriculum for new hire trainmen, in the same spirit as we’ve worked together to increase compensation and expand our mentoring partnerships for trainees,” SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson said. “More training directly translates to better safety for our members and demonstrates our shared commitment to the CSX safety culture.”CSX recently announced that its second-quarter 2023 net income fell 15% year over year to $996 million, or 49 cents per diluted share, from $1.18 billion, or 54 cents per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2022.In a separate release on Friday, the eastern U.S. Class I railroad announced the winners of its 29th annual chemical safety awards for the safe transportation of hazardous materials.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:CSX continues to target truck-to-rail conversionsCSX’s Q2 profit slips 15% on lower revenuesNTSB: Fatal Amtrak derailment shows need for more track inspectionsBNSF offers additional sick leave days to SMART-TDFreight rail leaders realize relationship rebuilding requiredThe post Railroads reach deals with unions on sick leave, conductor training appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. To wit, the Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) share price is 39% higher than it was a year ago, much better than the market return of around 10% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term, investors will do very well! Also impressive, the stock is up 30% over three years, making long term shareholders happy, too.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 1 year and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Ross Stores While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year, Ross Stores actually saw its earnings per share drop 0.08%.We don't think that the decline in earnings per share is a good measure of the business over the last twelve months. It makes sense to check some of the other fundamental data for an explanation of the share price rise.We are skeptical of the suggestion that the 1.2% dividend yield would entice buyers to the stock. Revenue was pretty flat year on year, but maybe a closer look at the data can explain the market optimism.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthRoss Stores is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth.

And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 6%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

It leases space on its towers to wireless service providers, supporting their wireless networks.

The following income breakdown provides further insight into SBA Communications' financial performance:Is SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisDeciphering the GF Value of SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC)The GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. This value indicates the fair trading value of the stock. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) appears to be a potential value trap. The GF Value estimates the stock's fair value at $391.3, significantly above its current price of $227.57 per share. This discrepancy indicates a potential value trap, suggesting investors should think twice before investing.Story continuesIs SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of SBA CommunicationsInvestors should always assess the financial strength of a company before buying its stock. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. A great way to understand a company's financial strength is by looking at its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Unfortunately, SBA Communications has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.01, worse than 86.03% of companies in the REITs industry. This low ratio indicates poor financial strength, with an overall score of 2 out of 10.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisProfitability and Growth of SBA CommunicationsConsistently profitable companies offer less risk for investors. Higher profit margins usually indicate a better investment compared to a company with lower profit margins. SBA Communications has been profitable 7 over the past 10 years, with an operating margin of 37.99%. This margin ranks worse than 66.92% of companies in the REITs industry. However, the overall profitability of SBA Communications is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.Growth is a crucial factor in a company's valuation.

Its 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 10.3%, ranking better than 69.64% of companies in the REITs industry. This strong growth suggests value creation for its shareholders.ROIC vs. WACC: A Profitability EvaluationComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, SBA Communications's ROIC was 8.11, while its WACC came in at 6.4, suggesting value creation.Is SBA Communications (SBAC) a Value Trap? An In-depth GF Value AnalysisIs SBA Communications a Value Trap?Despite the promising growth and profitability, SBA Communications appears to be a potential value trap. This assessment is based on the company's low cash-to-debt ratio and the Altman Z-score of 0.42, which places the company's financial health in the distress zone and signals an increased bankruptcy risk. Ideally, an Altman Z-score above 2.99 reflects a safer financial position.

The reconciliation of and other information regarding these items can be found in our supplemental financial data package, which is located on the landing page of our Investor Relations website. With that, I will now turn it over to Brendan to discuss our second quarter results.Story continuesBrendan Thomas CavanaghThank you, Mark. Good evening. We had another steady quarter in Q2 with solid financial results that were slightly ahead of our expectations. Based on these results and our updated expectations for the balance of the year, we have increased our full year 2023 outlook for site leasing revenue, tower cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share. Total GAAP site leasing revenues for the second quarter were $626.1 million, and cash site leasing revenues were $618.7 million. Foreign exchange rates represented a benefit of approximately $1.9 million when compared with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter and a headwind of $4.2 million when compared to the second quarter of 2022. Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the second quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis was 4.3% net over the second quarter of 2022, and including the impact of 3.9% of churn.On a gross basis, same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth was 8.2%. The Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.8% on a gross basis and 4.2% on a net basis, including 3.6% of churn. Domestic operational leasing activity or bookings representing new revenue placed under contract during the second quarter declined from the first quarter. While all major carriers remained active with their networks, agreement execution levels in the second quarter from several of our customers were below our prior expectations. Longer term, we continue to see significant runway for new 5G-related leasing activity based on the number of our sites that remain to be upgraded with mid-band spectrum deployments by the major mobile network operators.In addition, today, we announced that we have entered into a new long-term master lease agreement with AT&amp;T. This comprehensive agreement will streamline AT&amp;T's deployment of 5G solutions across our tower portfolio while providing us with committed future leasing growth from AT&amp;T for years to come. Based on this MLA, we have increased our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from domestic organic new leases and amendments by $6 million from the full year projections we provided last quarter.During the second quarter, amendment activity represented 42% of our domestic bookings and new leases represented 58%. The big 4 carriers of AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented approximately 89% of total incremental domestic leasing revenue that was signed up during the quarter. Domestically, churn was slightly elevated during the quarter, primarily due to faster decommissioning of legacy Sprint leases than we had projected, which is the opposite of our experience last year. Based on our current analysis, we expect Sprint related churn for 2023 will be at the high end of our previously stated range for this year of $25 million to $30 million, resulting in a change to our full year domestic churn outlook of $4 million.Our views around the ultimate multiyear cumulative impact of Sprint merger-related churn have not changed. Although we continue to update our outlook around timing as more information becomes available. We now project 2024 Sprint related churn to be in a range of $20 million to $30 million, 2025 to be between $35 million and $45 million. 2026 to be $45 million to $55 million and 2027 to be $10 million to $20 million. Just as last year ended up being well below our initial churn expectations and 2023 will likely be a little above our initial expectations, we anticipate that the exact timing will continue to be somewhat fluid, but in line with our provided projections. Non-Sprint-related domestic churn was in line with our prior projections.Moving now to international results. On a constant currency basis, same-tower cash leasing revenue growth was 4.8% net, including 4.9% of churn or 9.7% on a gross basis. International leasing activity was strong in the second quarter and ahead of our internal expectations. These positive results and our solid backlogs have allowed us to increase our projected contribution to 2023 leasing revenue from international organic new leases and amendments by $1 million. Inflation-based escalators also continued to make steady contributions to our organic growth. However, decreases in actual and projected Brazilian CPI rates have caused us to moderate our outlook for international escalation contributions for the full year by approximately $1 million.Overall, Brazil, our largest international market, had another very good quarter. The same-tower organic growth rate in Brazil was 5.7% on a constant currency basis, including the impact of 5.6% of churn, which amount was significantly impacted by our previously discussed TIM agreement. While international churn remains elevated, it continues to be in line with expectations and our previously provided outlook.As a reminder, our 2023 outlook does not include any churn assumptions related to the Oi consolidation other than that associated with the TAM agreement. However, if during the year, we were to enter into any further agreements with other carriers related to the Oi consolidation that would be expected to have an impact on our current year, we would adjust our outlook accordingly at that time. During the second quarter, 77.5% of consolidated cash site leasing revenue was denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue was from Brazil, with Brazil representing 16.2% of consolidated cash site leasing revenues during the quarter and 13.1% of cash site leasing revenue, excluding revenues from pass-through expenses.Tower cash flow for the second quarter was $503.5 million, Tower cash flow in the quarter benefited by approximately $7.3 million in accounting-driven cost reclassifications. Our tower cash flow margins remain very strong, with second quarter domestic tower cash flow margin of 85.5% and an international tower cash flow margin of 70.3% or 92.3%, excluding the impact of pass-through reimbursable expenses.Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $471.7 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 70.3% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of revenues from pass-through expenses, adjusted EBITDA margin was 75.9%. Approximately 98% of our total adjusted EBITDA was attributable to our tower leasing business in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our services business had another strong quarter with $52.4 million in revenue and $13.1 million of segment operating profit. While off year ago activity levels, our carrier customers remained busy deploying new 5G-related equipment during the quarter, and we have retained our full year outlook for our site development business due in part to the strength of our first half results. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO in the second quarter was $352.7 million. AFFO per share was $3.24, an increase of 6.2% over the second quarter of 2022 on a constant currency basis.During the second quarter, we continued to invest in additions to our portfolio, acquiring 9 communication sites for total cash consideration of $7.2 million and building 64 new sites. Subsequent to quarter end, we have purchased or are under agreement to purchase 134 sites, all in our existing markets for an aggregate price of $72.9 million.We anticipate closing on these sites under contract by the end of the year. In addition to new towers, we also continue to invest in the land under our sites, and during the quarter, we spent an aggregate of $10.1 million to buy land and easements and to extend ground lease terms. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled for more than 20 years the land underneath approximately 70% of our towers, and the average remaining life under our ground leases, including renewal options under our control, is approximately 36 years.With that, I will now turn things over to Mark, who will provide an update on our balance sheet.Mark DeRussyThanks, Brendan. We ended the quarter with $12.7 billion of total debt and $12.4 billion of net debt. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6x, below the low end of our target range and the lowest level in decades. Our second quarter net cash interest coverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net cash interest expense was a strong 4.9x. During a subsequent to quarter end, we repaid amounts under our revolving credit facility. And as of today, we have $360 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion revolver. The current weighted-average interest rate of our total outstanding debt was 3.1%, with a weighted-average maturity of approximately 3.5 years. The current rate on our outstanding revolver balance was 6.3%. The interest rate of 95% of our current outstanding debt is fixed.During the quarter, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock, choosing instead to reduce revolver balances. We currently have $505 million of repurchase authorization remaining under our $1 billion stock repurchase plan. The company shares outstanding at June 30, 2023, were 108.4 million. In addition, during the quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $92.1 million or $0.85 per share. And today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.85 per share payable on September 20, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 24, 2023. This dividend represents an increase of approximately 20% over the dividend we paid in the year ago period, and only 26% of our projected full year AFFO.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.Jeffrey A. StoopsThanks, Mark, and good evening, everyone. The second quarter was another very solid one for SBA. We produced good financial results across all areas of our business, and we continue to deliver high-quality service and operating results for our customers. Each of our largest U.S. customers remained active with their networks. Our customers continue to add equipment to sites in support of 5G through the deployment of new spectrum bands as well as to expand coverage through brand new co-locations. We did, however, see the same slowdown in activity that many others have discussed. While we had always anticipated domestic leasing growth to moderate as we move through 2023, organic leasing activity levels were lower than we anticipated in Q2 from some of our customers.Some of this was due, we believe, to slower activity from AT&amp;T in anticipation of our new MLA as would be expected. We believe that these variations in activity are part of the normal cycle of carrier network investment that we have seen over time, a large initial burst of coverage activity as the next generation of technology starts to be deployed, followed by many years of coverage completion and capacity building.We are confident that there will be additional material network investment over the next several years. We believe this for a number of reasons. Most importantly, wireless demand continues to grow at a fast clip, consuming more and more of current network capacity. We have a large remaining number of sites that have not been upgraded yet to accommodate the mid-band spectrum holdings acquired by our customers over the last couple of years, some of which spectrum is not even available for deployment yet. DISH has their next phase of regulatory coverage requirements to meet in 2025, and we have our newly signed MLA with AT&amp;T. We believe all of these items and others are supportive of multiyear continued development activity. While there will always be ebbs and flows in leasing activity levels based on a variety of factors, we believe that there will remain a need for continuous network investment just as we have seen throughout our history in this business. With regard to our announced master lease agreement with AT&amp;T, we're very excited about this next chapter in our long-standing successful relationship.This new agreement highlights the long-term importance of SBA sites to AT&amp;T's future network deployment plans. The agreement will improve operating efficiencies between our organizations and enhance stability with regard to future leasing growth. We look forward to working closely with AT&amp;T for years to come under this mutually beneficial framework. In the second quarter, our services business remained busy helping our carrier customers meet deployment objectives in an efficient and effective manner. While our services business is down on a year-over-year basis, 2023 will still represent the second biggest service this year in our company's history behind only 2022. We believe our legacy and reputation in the Services business keeps us well positioned to be a go-to provider for our customers to meet their network rollout goals.Internationally, we also had another solid quarter with greater organic leasing activity than we had anticipated. During the quarter, 62% of new international business signed up in the quarter came from amendments to existing leases and 38% came through new leases with strong contributions broadly for many of our markets, including Central America, Brazil and South Africa. Brazil, our largest market outside of the U.S. was ahead of our internal expectations with contributions from each of the big 3 carriers in that market. I continue to be pleased with our operational performance, cost management and customer relationships in Brazil, which has made us a leader in the market. And we have recently seen positive movements in the currency exchange rate, providing some financial benefit and increased U.S. dollars for repatriation as well as contributing to our increased full year outlook. We remain excited about our opportunities in Brazil.During the quarter, we again generated solid AFFO providing significant cash for discretionary allocation. While our strong financial position allows us to retain flexibility for future further opportunistic investment in portfolio growth and stock repurchases, we dedicated the majority of our available cash in the quarter to paying down the outstanding balance on our revolver.We immediately benefit from this by reducing our floating rate cash interest obligations which today represent among the highest cost debt in our capital structure. With the continuing high cost and limited availability of private market tower acquisition opportunities, we believe this is currently our best use of discretionary spending. Our quarter ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio was 6.6%, which I believe to be the lowest in our history, at least as a public company. As always, we will continue to be opportunistic around investments, but for the near term, likely direct future cash flows into the repayment of debt as the most accretive short term and certainly a long-term beneficial use of capital. Our balance sheet is in great shape with no debt maturities until October 2024. And since that maturity could easily be refinanced under our revolver, we are comfortable now to remain opportunistic around timing of future financings. We are a preferred issuer in the debt markets we routinely use and retain very good access to capital.We finished the quarter with 95% of our debt fixed and thus, we are only modestly exposed for now to significant interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to floating rate debt is also expected to decline further as we continue paying down our outstanding revolver balance throughout the year. We feel very good about our current capital position. We feel fortunate to be in a sound, stable business with tremendous fundamentals and significant long-term opportunity ahead. Our customers continue to have significant network needs, and we will be there to support them in meeting those needs. I want to thank our team members and our customers for their contributions to our shared success.And with that, Eric, we are now ready for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And first, we will hear from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.Richard Hamilton PrentissObviously, I have some questions on the AT&amp;T MLA, big news item there. I appreciate, I think, Brendan, you said $6 million of the increase in new lease activity was really driven by AT&amp;T MLA it...Jeffrey A. StoopsRic, can you speak up? We're having trouble hearing you. Ric?Richard Hamilton PrentissHow about now? can you hear me better now?Jeffrey A. StoopsThat's much better. Thank you.Richard Hamilton PrentissYou bet. Yes, I'm sorry about that. I had another phone call come in. I was like no, doing something busy. Yes, I appreciate some of the color on the MLA with AT&amp;T. A couple of questions around it. Why now? And any others that you're working on? And then also suggesting that $6 million increase in guidance came from that, it looks like we should be thinking maybe of kind of flattish new lease activity over the next couple of quarters. And as we exit '23, is that the way we should be thinking about it.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. So on the MLA, first of all, on the numbers, the $6 million increase is basically due to the MLA. Obviously, that was our -- the 72% is what we reported last time, we increased to 78%, and activity was a little bit slower in the second quarter. So we expect that the MLA will kick in right away based on the terms of it and will be a contributor going forward.In terms of the cadence, it would be fairly flat. I would expect actually that we'll see an uptick in terms of the contribution to the third quarter as a result of the MLA and then you'll see it be a little bit lower into the fourth quarter. And that lower trajectory has nothing to do with the MLA. That's really based on slowing activity from other carriers. If you recall correctly, we had kind of a trajectory expected that was downward leaning throughout the year, and I would expect that will continue as it relates to other contributors.In terms of why, Ric, this agreement with AT&amp;T has been in the works for well over a year. And it's a deal that we believe is beneficial to both organizations. We've been working on it for that period of time and trying to signal and be transparent to our openness for this type of agreement knowing that we were likely to enter into this agreement, which we have. We really don't want to comment too much on what's going on with other customers. But just as we have always said, we are not hung up so much on structure as we are on finding mutually beneficial agreements with our customers.Richard Hamilton PrentissOkay. And one other one for me on the -- paying down the revolver. When does the calculus move back towards stock buyback? Because it sounds like there's still not a lot of M&amp;A out there, which would be probably your first choice. But how do we think about when the lever moves since you're down to 6.6 leverage to more stock buyback? Is that like a next year item? Is that further out?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. I think if rates stay the same and stock prices stay the same, it's -- it will continue to be more accretive. And obviously, good for the overall capital position to continue to pay down the revolver to 0. So when we get to that point, Ric, we should -- you could ask that question again.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Michael Rollins with Citi.Michael Ian RollinsJust curious, just a follow-up on the comprehensive deal with AT&amp;T. Can you share some of the multiyear components of this deal? Is there going to be a straight-line element that sometimes comes up with these types of multiyear or comprehensive opportunities? And does it change the way investors should think about leasing overall for SBA in 2024 in the domestic side?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes, Mike. So it will certainly smooth the way that we operate with AT&amp;T. So I think from that perspective, perhaps it impacts our reported growth numbers in terms of ebbs and flows. There may be a little bit less of that, at least as it relates to this particular agreement. From a straight-line impact, we would expect that over the course of the agreement that we will have some straight-line impacts, but there are no straight line -- or very minimal straight-line impacts in the short term.Michael Ian RollinsAnd just on the commentary on leasing. So the site development revenues are unchanged from the prior guidance. But you did note that there was some slower activity levels. Was this just something that you were maybe more prepared for earlier in the year? Or is there anything different about your site development business that maybe gave your expectation a little more durability in spite of some of the changes that you observed?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. I think we know our site development business very well. You know it primarily centers around work -- almost entirely work on our towers. So we have a very good feel for it. And there's just enough work out there Mike, that was already booked earlier in the year and actually some of it probably spilling over from last year, that's now working itself through our services backlog that gives us the comfort to continue with the guidance that we have. So a lot of it is more a reflection of activity levels that occurred Q1, Q4 of last year.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.Simon William FlanneryGreat. I was just wondering on the leverage point, have you had any more consideration of targeting investment-grade status? Or is that -- is this going to be just a temporary that change in your overall leverage targets. And then you could just talk on...Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. Right now, I think you should assume it's temporary so that we can continue to watch interest rates and see where they go. If interest rates stay high, it may not be temporary. We haven't made that decision yet. Actually, we're paying down the revolver because it's the most economic and best use of our cash today. It just so happens that as we continue to do that, we further decrease leverage, which makes the path of going to investment grade, if we were to so choose that path easier to obtain. But I really don't think you should look at it, Simon, as a conscious effort to get to investment grade as much as it is just the best financial use of our discretionary cash.Simon William FlanneryGreat. Yes. And just one follow-up. You mentioned earlier that you still got a lot of sites that have not been upgraded to 5G. Do you think as given some of the rural SKU of your portfolio, do you think that would advantage to your portfolio in the next several years versus to that initial build out?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. I think if history is any guide, I guess, that's exactly how it works. It starts out in the NFL cities, it goes from there.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.Philip A. CusickTwo, if I can. How should we think about the exit run rate in activity this year versus going into next year? AT&amp;T, it sounds like is steady in 3Q and 4Q and then from there and others are decelerating through this year. Should we think of the fourth quarter as a decent run rate for next year or maybe a little bit lower than that? And then second, Jeff, I didn't understand your comment just a second ago on the service revenue now for activity earlier in the year. And it sounds like services are still running well ahead of historical levels. Do you expect them to come in -- it sounds like you expect them -- you're going to make the guide this year, but next year, it sounds like things are going to be probably well below. Does that make sense?Jeffrey A. StoopsGo ahead, Brendan.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. So on the first question, we do -- we expect that the fourth quarter run rate, you're talking specifically, just to be clear about domestic organic leasing contribution to be around approximately $17 million to $17.5 million. But I would definitely caution you as to using that as an indicator of next year. As I mentioned earlier, the trajectory based on activity levels is declining. And as a result, we would expect those numbers to step down as we move into next year. We're obviously not ready to give 2024 guidance yet at this point. but just kind of broadly when you think about it, the way we've always explained it and just the way that it actually happens is that you get a lot of growth, for instance, the 2023 growth is based heavily on the leasing activity that took place at the end of last year, 2022. And next year's numbers will be based heavily on the leasing activity that's taking place this year.So the number is a little bit higher than we said before because of the impacts of the MLA for the fourth quarter, but I don't believe will be indicative of the numbers for next year.Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. And as far as the services revenue, Phil, the first half of what we report in 2024 will be largely dictated by what we do now operationally with leasing. We have 2 different components of that. We have the site acquisition component, which is the planning stuff, and then we have the construction, which is where a lot of the current activity is taking place because that's the last part of the cycle. So we'll see. We'll see where we come out with the guidance on services, but it will be obviously heavily impacted by how we finish out the rest of the year.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Jonathan Atkin with RBC.Jonathan AtkinSo I was interested in doing just to contextualize the AT&amp;T MLA, how much of your revenues for kind of this year next year, the following year, can we be considered to be fairly locked in as opposed to usage based -- segmental revenue.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes, you mean just the percentage of the AT&amp;T revenue or overall revenue?Jonathan AtkinOverall revenue for the whole company, how do we kind of think about how much is kind of a lock versus more of a (inaudible) as well.Brendan Thomas CavanaghRight. Jon, we can't give specific numbers out. And obviously, a number of our agreements with other customers are fluid and where those amounts end up or -- is obviously unknown. So as a percentage, it's hard to say as well. So we can't be very specific about it, but we do have some portion of our revenue base that is locked in now under this agreement that wasn't before.Jeffrey A. StoopsAnd a greater portion of the AT&amp;T then probably exists under other agreements, although we still have some of that. And I mean I don't think that's not a number that we have focused on. So the best we can answer, Jonathan, is that it's a much greater extent under the AT&amp;T revenue.Jonathan AtkinThen -- and you're comparing that to your agreements with other carriers as opposed to other TowerCos agreements with AT&amp;T, I'm assuming?Jeffrey A. StoopsCorrect. Yes. correct.Jonathan AtkinGot it. Yes, understood. And then maybe just give us some directional guidance around the trajectory around building new towers and ground lease and easements activity.Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. I mean we continue to look for good, financially smart new build opportunities. We're doing those mostly outside the United States primarily Brazil and South Africa, our 2 largest markets outside the United States. And we have a steady focus on ground lease purchases and extensions, which hasn't changed at all. It's moved a little bit more international in terms of the mix just because we've been at it so long in the United States. But nothing's really changed there. We would put more capital into particularly the land purchases and extensions if the opportunities arose.Jonathan AtkinAnd then in terms of purchasing other portfolios, maybe thinking about Africa and your operating history there and maybe some tuck-in opportunities, either that geography or elsewhere, what are your thoughts on increasing your scale in existing markets versus expanding the footprint?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. I mean, the answer to that question is pretty much the same as it has been for years, for the right deal, we will do it. We have no strategic hole that we feel needs to be filled. In market growth because of the existing base is going to be preferred over new market growth, but we would still go into a new market, if we found the right deal. And I would point back to the Tanzania investment as a good example of that. But because it's all financially driven, it makes our decision to use discretionary cash to pay down the revolver that much more straightforward.Jonathan AtkinLastly, I might have missed this, but the duration of the AT&amp;T MLA?Brendan Thomas CavanaghIt's 5 years, Jonathan.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from David Barden with Bank of America.David William BardenSo I guess maybe 2. The first one, Jeff, just with respect to some of the actions that your competitors are taking pros and cons for being in the construction business for towers at all? Is there may be an opportunity to redirect resources in more optimal ways? Or is there an opportunity if people are willing to give up business for you guys to lean in at the margin as we think about the go ahead business? And then second, maybe for Mark, as we think about the 25 term loan and its maturity what should the Street be doing in terms of expectations in the model with respect to how we address that cost fixed, long-term roll it? What is the plan?Jeffrey A. StoopsDave, I'm going to defer that to our expert here, Brendan.Brendan Thomas CavanaghOn the services question, David, we've had a lot of history. Actually, you recall, that's how SBA started. So we have a very flexible cost structure that allows us to ramp up, ramp down we use a lot of subcontracted tower crews. We have our own, but we also use subcontracted tower crews. And one of the things that has really served us well and our customers give us high praise for this is by using our services people for work on our towers for them, they are greatly benefited in terms of speed to market and efficiencies. So I don't think that changes. So I guess if I had to choose 1 of your 2 options lean out or lean in, we'll look to lean in and not be afraid to do that because of our confidence in how we manage that business.Mark DeRussyAnd Dave, on the term loan, your question of modeling, if I can only say into the future enough, but we, yes. I mean, the best thing, I think, for people to do when looking at it is probably to assume a similar like-for-like refinancing. And I would expect that spreads will be similar to up slightly from where they are today, but we'll have to see how that plays out. And then it's just a matter of using the forward curve in terms of the benchmark, SOFR Rate. But that doesn't mean that that's necessarily how it will play out. We will probably have -- we will be evaluating multiple different options. There may be a mix of different instruments that we use. Some may be fixed and some may be floating, but all things are on the table for us right now, and we look at that, frankly, every day. But if you're just simply modeling out long term, I think the best thing to do is to assume a like-for-like instrument.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Walter Piecyk with LightShed.Walter Paul PiecykCan you hear me?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes.Walter Paul PiecykAll right. Perfect. Sorry. The -- if you didn't have the AT&amp;T MLA, would the 72 still stick? Or would that fall off accelerating faster than you thought in terms of the second half of the year?Brendan Thomas CavanaghI can't really answer that question, Walt, because there's so many elements that go into it. What would the activity be with AT&amp;T, otherwise, those types of things. So I can't really say for sure what it would be, given that we were working on this for quite a while.(technical difficulty)First, we don't like to discuss the individual customers, but obviously, DISH has just gotten through a major deadline that they had. There's a little bit of a slowdown or pause, if you will, related to that. And we would expect that will eventually pick up. But given the delay between signings and revenue recognition, I would expect that will weigh year-over-year on next year. and T-Mobile was frankly very, very busy as well, and you have somewhat of a similar dynamic there. But that's what we're going into for next year. But longer term, there's still a lot to do there. So we tend (inaudible).Walter Paul PiecykSo if there was something incremental like qualitatively, what do you think those issues are?Brendan Thomas CavanaghIf there was something incremental in what sense?Walter Paul PiecykYou just -- in the response you just gave, meaning in Q2 was a little bit less, and you're saying you're expecting that to continue into the third and fourth quarter because, again, I think you guys did a good job historically already talking about a slowdown in the second half of the year? And also maybe how that would carry into 2024. And I'm just trying to get a sense of is there something new or worse?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. I don't think there's something particularly new. I think it's been a little bit slower than what we had anticipated before. But directionally, it's still the same. So what does that mean for next year? Does that mean $5 million difference or $10 million. I can't tell you yet. We're not ready to get there and we still have half the year to go. But it's marginally worse than what we thought in terms of the balance of the other carriers.Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. And I mean, the qualitative benefits or the positives to look forward to Walt, I mean, DISH has to get started, whether it's late Q4 or early Q1 on their 2025 bill, which is going to be large. T-Mobile hasn't even got the C-band and the 3.45 spectrum yet. You got the -- you got some folks waiting on availability of dual band equipment. So there's all kinds of things to look forward to as we move through the year and into next.Walter Paul PiecykAre you seeing anything from cable, Jeff?Jeffrey A. StoopsLittle bit, but not enough to give anyone the impression it's going to move the needle.OperatorAnd the next we'll hear from Batya Levi with UBS.Batya LeviGreat. A quick follow-up on the AT&amp;T MLA. Does it cover all the towers that AT&amp;T has equipment on your sites? And should we assume that the escalator in there is similar to the 3%, 3.5% that you have? And another one, I believe you said 42-58 mix for amendments and new leases. Can you give us a sense of how that will look like if we just exclude DISH?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. So I'm sorry, what was the first part of the question?Batya LeviAT&amp;T MLA, if it includes all the sites they have with you and the escalator.Brendan Thomas CavanaghRight. So it does -- there may be a few exceptions because of specific issues around individual sites, but the vast majority of our sites are covered by the MLA.Jeffrey A. StoopsThat have AT&amp;T on.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes, that have AT&amp;T on of course. And then on the escalator piece, I can't really get into the specifics around what the escalator is, but our historical escalator with AT&amp;T has been north of 3%, and we would expect that to continue.Batya LeviGreat. And the amendments without DISH, is that much higher than the 42%?Brendan Thomas CavanaghIt would be. It would be if you took DISH out of the mix, you would have a much higher percentage of amendments of the total.Batya LeviOkay. Maybe just a quick one. As you -- can you give us a sense on what the guidance assumes for DISH as we exit the year?Brendan Thomas CavanaghNo, we can't give you that kind of specificity now. But it's much less it was -- but it's much less than it was exiting last year.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.Nicholas Ralph Del DeoFirst, regarding the AT&amp;T deal, should we think of that as pulling forward some revenue that you otherwise would have expected in the latter years into the near future? And do you feel that the totality of the revenue that you'll get from AT&amp;T over the course of the contract is similar to what it otherwise would have been.Jeffrey A. StoopsThe answer to the last part of your question is yes, Nick. The answer to the first part, I don't think it's a pull forward.Brendan Thomas CavanaghI mean it's hard to say because, obviously, previously, it would be very specific to the timing of when they were signing things. We don't know exactly what that timing would be. So could be pulling forward, could be pushing.Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. The answer to your question will be only known in hindsight by the levels of AT&amp;T's activity.Nicholas Ralph Del DeoOkay. Okay. So we should think of it more, call it, smoothing a bit, but not necessarily sort of a mass reallocation of what the revenue would have been. Is that fair?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes.Nicholas Ralph Del DeoYes. Okay. Great. And then kind of 2 clarifications for Brendan. One, it looks like your forecast for other international revenue went up by about $9 million versus last quarter's guidance. What was that? And was it in this quarter's results? And then second, can you elaborate a bit on the $7 million in cost reclassifications that you noted in your prepared remarks -- what was it reclassified to and from? What was behind it, which segment?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. So the other international was -- roughly half of that was in the second quarter. There is some that is in the balance of the year. And it's frankly a mix of things. It's not 1 thing in particular. There was some increased cash basis revenue recovery that we did not necessarily forecast and some that we've actually even seen subsequent to quarter end. And then also some termination fees. And just other frankly, cats and dogs, Nick, but they did add up and we actually have higher expectations for the balance of the year. So that's that piece of it.On the accounting reclassification it basically has to do with the decommissioning of some carrier-related equipment, basically Sprint oriented equipment at some of our tower sites that we previously had expected or had been recording as a cost of revenue -- a direct cost of revenue. But after discussion with our accountants, it was determined that the best classification for that was impairment and decommissioning costs. So basically, it's just a move of those costs out of cost of revenue and into impairment and decommission costs.Nicholas Ralph Del DeoOkay. So sort of a onetime true-up?Brendan Thomas CavanaghThere was some onetime true-up in there, but that's the way to also be going forward, and that's assumed within the guidance that we've given around tower cash flow.Nicholas Ralph Del DeoOkay. Can you share anything about how much of the change was attributable to that beyond the $7 million recognized in the quarter, what it would be for the full year?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. It's another roughly $4 million.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.Brett Joseph FeldmanTwo questions, if you don't mind. When some of your peers announced their own versions of MLAs or holistic agreements or whatever they call it, it's not uncommon when they announce it for them, they come out and say, ""Oh, by the way, we're raising our guidance for straight-line revenue. I know you got a question about this earlier, but it's typically because there's some incremental commitment that was made in that agreement, maybe use escalators or some other amount of leasing. And you didn't do that with this agreement. So I can imagine a question we're going to get is, ultimately, what do you feel like you accomplished through the MLA because you've been very selective and entering into these larger agreements? And I know there's been some questions on it, but I'm trying to think about the right way of framing that.And then the second question is portfolio growth has been a focus for SBA for a very long time. I remember the analyst meeting, I don't know, 15-plus years ago when you first started talking about those long-term targets. And it's understandable why paying down your revolver right now is probably the economically most accretive thing to do. But whenever we get past this moment, do you think portfolio growth is going to be the same priority and same opportunity? Or are you starting to suspect that maybe the tower portfolios that you don't own in the markets you're in or might want to be and are not nearly as attractive as the types of portfolios you could just develop on your own, particularly outside the U.S.Jeffrey A. StoopsI will take the last one first. I believe portfolio growth will always be our most desirable and highest potential allocation of capital. Where it falls today, I mean, keep in mind, we grew the portfolio 15% last year. Where it falls today is purely a function of cost of debt and availability and pricing of assets. But as long as all that works out, Brett, to achieve an investment result that we want, I don't see the preference and prioritization of portfolio growth changing.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. And Brett, on the question around the straight line for the MLA, there actually was you couldn't see it, but there is actually some small impact to straight line that was actually offset by a decrease in straight line associated with some of the accelerated Sprint churn that we mentioned earlier. So there is a small impact. But in terms of what it looks like going forward, obviously, what our peers have done and what we've done, they're probably not exactly the same agreements. I'm sure there are terms that are different. I can't speak to their specifically. But really, it's a function of timing in terms of when certain commitments take place. And in the future, I would expect that there will be some straight-line impact as a result of this deal, but it's a little more activity driven than it is upfront.Jeffrey A. StoopsIt will -- you will see straight-line benefits over time over the course of the 5 years, Brett, based on various triggers and activity levels as opposed to upon signing.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.Jonathan ChaplinOne just very basic question. How do you assess that paying down the revolver is the most accretive use of free cash flow? How do you sort of put that up against the accretion you get from share repurchase? Is it as simple as what the yield of the debt is relative to your AFFO yield? And are you taking the direction of rates into consideration when you make that determination? Or is it just sort of a moment-by-moment decision that drives whether you're in the market buying back stock or paying down the revolver? And then just a follow-up question on DISH. Is there anything assumed in new leasing activity for the second half of this year from DISH in your guidance?Brendan Thomas CavanaghSo the accretion analysis takes into account a number of things. There's certainly the basic straightforward piece that you mentioned, which is what's the yield of buying back our stock today versus what can we save by paying down the revolver or any debt. And right now, that actually is more accretive to pay down the revolver today. But we also look at it long term, and we look at our expectations for growth and cash flow as well as what we think our future financing or refinancing costs will be and that positioning relative to our balance sheet as a whole is also relevant to it.Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. And that bodes towards stock repurchases, Jonathan, with one major exception today, which is we don't know that interest rates have stopped going up. And when interest rates go up, it immediately affects the cost on the revolver. We can always buy our stock back. And that -- we take comfort in that. But when you have an increasing interest rate environment where we don't know when it's over, we just think both from a business perspective and certainly a balance sheet perspective and from an accretion perspective, pay down the revolver balance while we have one is the way to go.Brendan Thomas CavanaghAnd DISH in terms of the impact for the second half of the year, as we mentioned, it's obviously been slower in terms of new business being signed up with them. There's still a significant contributor to the second half numbers because of all the business that they did with us over the last year. But we expect that we'll continue to see, at least for this year, less executions with them. But ultimately, they have a ton to do, as we talked about to meet their 25% goal, and we would expect that, that will turn around sometime at the end of the year or into next year.OperatorAnd next, we'll hear from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo.Eric Thomas LuebchowJust going back to the question on investment grade. I know that's clearly not part of the plan right now. But theoretically, if you did make that decision, what type of leverage do you think you'd have to target to get there? And how quickly do you think you could get there based on where your leverage is at today?Brendan Thomas CavanaghWell, based on the thresholds that are there by the agencies or at least by one of the agencies right now, we're getting very close to being there, certainly within a half turn of leverage of being there. But it would be more about the commitment to staying there than it would be about hitting the leverage above that trigger.Eric Thomas LuebchowYes. Understood. And then just another question on the comprehensive MLA. I mean does this it all indicates that you guys would still be open to entering into simpler arrangements with some of the other carriers to maybe smooth out some of the leasing volatility? Or is it really just a case-by-case basis what you think would be NPV positive for your business?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. I mean it's really the latter. But I mean, we've always said we would be open to a variety of structures I mean this, I think, evidences that openness. So for the right deal, Eric, we would do any number of structures with our customers.OperatorAnd next will hear from Brendan Lynch with Barclays.Brendan James LynchAt the risk of belaboring the point, I have a few on the MLA. Maybe just high level, given the MLA with Tim and now with AT&amp;T, has the market changed? Have customers changed? Or has your perspective changed? And then maybe if you could give us any specifics along the number of sites, minimum payment schedule. You mentioned it was sort of 5 years, but I'd imagine the leases are for much longer. Any details around that would be helpful.Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. I think in terms of the details, we need to keep -- stay away from most of those. There's a lot of specific things that you asked about there that obviously are somewhat important for us to keep confidential for both us and our customers. But it is a 5-year agreement and there will be a lot of ramifications that I would expect would extend beyond the 5 years.In terms of the M&amp;A in general, I think Jeff kind of mentioned -- answered this earlier. It's -- we've always been open to different structures, obviously, at different points in time in our history. We haven't necessarily found terms that we found to be beneficial to us or they didn't work for our customers, whatever the case may be. So we've done less of those. But we've done MLAs over the years in various structures, we have in MLA today with Verizon, we've had MLAs with T-Mobile and with DISH. So we've done these agreements before, but each one is dependent upon the specifics around that carrier and their needs at the time and what works for both parties. So I don't know that anything has holistically changed out in the market broadly.Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. I mean, we are trying to be responsive to our customers, while at the same time being responsible to ourselves and our shareholders. and that will continue to be kind of the big picture as to how we approach these things, and it could lead to more or if this could be the only one.Brendan James LynchMaybe just to clarify a point. I think you've described some of your past MLAs as being pricing menus. Is that how you would characterize this arrangement with AT&amp;T or is there a better way to think about it?Jeffrey A. StoopsYes. This would be a little different than that. This would be payments in exchange for AT&amp;T having certain rights to use our towers.OperatorAnd now we'll hear from Greg Williams with TD Cowen.Gregory Bradford WilliamsJust first question on any further developments with Oi beyond Tim with the other carriers, any ongoing discussions are you having them? And are you hopeful you can get anything done by year-end? And then just second, on the site development, it sounds like it'll hang out in the low 50s for the next few quarters. Anything to think about in terms of service margins from here?Brendan Thomas CavanaghYes. On the Oi question, you're talking specifically about deals with the other carriers that took over Oi Wireless I believe. Yes, we are having conversations with those other carriers. And it's possible that there would be some other arrangements truck with them, but it's premature for us to say. And obviously, if we do reach one, we'll let you know at that time. And then on the site development question, I would expect that the margins will stay pretty similar on a percentage basis to what you've seen during the first half of this year. The volume may be a hair lower, but pretty flat. Your estimate of around 50 or so quarters is probably about right.OperatorAnd we have no further questions at this time.Jeffrey A. StoopsGreat. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening, and we look forward to getting back together in late October for our third quarter report. Thank you.OperatorAnd that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Event Conferencing. You may now disconnect.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Visa (NYSE:V). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Visa How Fast Is Visa Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Visa managed to grow EPS by 15% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Visa maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$32b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$246m. This comes in at 0.05% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesDoes Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Visa is that it is growing profits. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Of course, just because Visa is growing does not mean it is undervalued.

For those interested in an income stream, let’s take a closer look at each.VisaVisa is a global payments technology company providing transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing, and settlement) to financial institutions and merchant clients. Analysts have raised earnings expectations, helping land Visa into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa shares currently yield a modest 0.8% annually, a few ticks above its Zacks – Financial Transaction Services industry average. Impressively, the company’s payout has grown by more than 15% just over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company posted a double beat in its latest release, extending a long history of delivering better-than-expected results.ASML HoldingASML Holding has seen positive earnings estimate revisions across its current fiscal year and next following a recent guidance upgrade, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company boasts a big growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar 45% in its current year on 32% higher revenues.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchASML shares currently yield 0.9% paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 32% of earnings. The company has committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, boasting a sizable 36% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, shares aren’t stretched regarding valuation on a relative basis, with the current 33.5X forward earnings multiple below the 35.6X five-year median and highs of 50.3X in 2022. Still, it’s worth noting that the value is undoubtedly on the higher end of the spectrum.Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a global healthcare company and a leader in the worldwide diabetes market. Analysts have taken their earnings estimates higher across nearly all timeframes over the last several months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNVO shares currently yield 1.1%, below its Zacks – Large Cap Pharmaceuticals average by a fair margin. Still, the company’s 13% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps pick up the slack, with the company’s 45% payout ratio also sitting at a sustainable level.Keep an eye out for the company’s upcoming release expected on August 2nd; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.34 suggests a 60% improvement in earnings from the year-ago quarter. Our consensus revenue estimate stands at $8.5 billion, 42% higher year-over-year.As we can see below, the company has recently enjoyed rapid revenue growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineDividends are a massive boost to any portfolio, helping to offset the losses in other positions. In addition, they provide a passive income stream, something any investor would enjoy.And for those seeking companies consistently growing their payouts, all three above – Visa V, ASML Holding ASML, and Novo Nordisk NVO – precisely fit the criteria.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

""You’re also seeing that inflation is calming down, which I think ... helps everybody think, 'Okay, you know what? We could actually have kind of a soft landing without a huge downfall.'""A soft economic landing is viewed by market watchers as a gradual slowing of an economy brought on by a series of interest rate hikes. On the flip side, a hard economic landing is when growth plunges, as a too-high level of interest rates stalls the economy.Marriott's forward US bookings and spending trends inside hotels signal as much, Oberg added.

Marriott International (MAR) CFO Leeny Oberg sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the recovery in the travel industry since coming out of the pandemic.“Every part of the world has come out of the pandemic at a little bit different time and a little bit different rate,” Oberg says, noting people aren’t taking travel “for granted anymore.” While the travel industry dealt with economic pressures, Oberg noted Marriott has seen job turnover rates ""calm down"" amid the Fed's rate hike environment and labor market conditions.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRIAN SOZZI: Strong travel demand and higher room rates boosted second quarter earnings for Marriott International. Company also raised its full year profit forecast and saw high rebound in international travel. Let's dive deeper into the quarter with Marriott CFO, Leeny Oberg. Leeny, good to have you on ""Yahoo Finance,"" welcome.LEENY OBERG: Thanks. Great to be with you.BRIAN SOZZI: This quarter was China led. What exactly are you seeing in this market? Because I think a lot of investors have been watching the headlines out of China. They're seeing potential for more stimulus. The economy is slowing down. But I didn't see that in your quarter.LEENY OBERG: So one way to think about this is every part of the world has come out of the pandemic at a little bit different time and a little bit different rate.So you think about a year ago, you saw the US absolutely cranking. And now what you're seeing as China has really relaxed the COVID restrictions. You're now seeing people really be out and about enjoying travel.So while we still haven't seen the same amount of cross-border travel into China yet, 76% has been the traditional amount of travel in China that's generated from domestic travelers.So in that respect, they are all out and about doing group business, leisure travel in China. And so sure enough, we saw extraordinary growth, more than double in rev par.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: Are there certain parts of China that are doing better than others? For US investors that may not be familiar with the market.LEENY OBERG: Yeah, no. I would say, overall, everywhere. But interesting pieces to your point is Macau, in the last couple of months, has seen an absolutely incredible spike.BRIAN SOZZI: Big gambling area.LEENY OBERG: So we saw-- yeah. And again, overwhelmingly Chinese visitors. So occupancy over 90% for the last couple of months, which, in our business, is extraordinary. And Hong Kong, while it's still not back as much as Mainland China, it's also recovering really nicely. So it's really on all cylinders.BRIAN SOZZI: How do the forward bookings look like for China?LEENY OBERG: Yeah. Also really good. So when you think about a group, which you can start to see some visibility out that's looking strong. Otherwise, you know, our business on the transient side is a fairly short booking window. So things can change quickly. But from the basic pace of what we see, really strong.BRIAN SOZZI: Let's get back to the US. Are you surprised by the resilience of the US consumer?LEENY OBERG: No, I'm really not. I think there are a couple of things going on. One, I don't think anybody takes travel for granted anymore.It's one of these things where we kind of had come to assume it's always part of life and I think COVID reminded everyone how much you love to get out for work, for play, for family. Drive two trips, fly two trips, wherever.BRIAN SOZZI: I can't stand my kitchen any longer.LEENY OBERG: I was going to say, those four walls. Those four walls get pretty tough. So I think that's part of it. But then the other part is, again, this resilience that's coming from leisure came first in a huge wave.But now both business and group are kind of falling in also in terms of big rebounds. And that's really helping support this base level of demand that I think will carry us in the future quite well.BRIAN SOZZI: At least for me, I think you had one of the best quotes so far of earnings season on a conference call. I'm a bit of a conference call geek. You said today you see a soft landing. Why is that the case? And what does a soft economic landing mean to you and the Marriott team?LEENY OBERG: So again, go back to where we were a couple quarters ago. And as you remember, everybody was kind of expecting that by the time we get to Q3 or Q4, we're looking at a real recession, et cetera, et cetera.What you've seen lately is still really strong employment numbers, increased expectations for GDP growth. You're also seeing that inflation is calming down, which, I think, again, helps everybody think, OK, you know what? We could actually have kind of a soft landing without a huge downfall.And that, again, gives support for businesses to think about investing. So as they think about going and holding group meetings or going and looking at new projects, when you think there's a bit of a steadier platform to look at for growth, it gives you more comfort about going out and spending that money and send people-- sending people on the road.BRIAN SOZZI: So then have you seen an acceleration in the number of rooms you're looking to open?LEENY OBERG: Well, we certainly just added the MGM room. So we went from expecting growth in rooms this year of 4% to 4 and 1/2% to now 6.4% to 6.7%. So that, obviously, is great acceleration and we're thrilled with that strategic enterprise agreement.But when I think about the other parts, I would say, it's kind of steady as she goes relative to a quarter ago. Which is that we are adding rooms nicely. The rooms that are in the US and Europe in particular, definitely see the impact of a tougher financing environment.So taking a little bit longer for rooms to go under construction, a little bit longer for them to get financed. But they are getting done. It's just taking a bit longer.BRIAN SOZZI: How do you see that playing out? What's the trajectory looking for next year? If the Fed is done raising interest rates. There's what, I think, a 19% probability that September that they raise rates, which to me, they're probably not going to do it. What does that mean to your business next year?LEENY OBERG: Well, again, to the extent that we see a fairly steady environment in the economy, both here and obviously outside is important for us as well, that bodes really well for our business.BRIAN SOZZI: We are coming up on another jobs report. And we've talked at length with the Marriott team about it's hard-- it's not just you. It's Hilton. It's all the lodging players.Getting the jobs and the people you need to staff those new hotels or staff basic services in the hotels. Where are you at now that the market is slow, job market has slowed, maybe some more people out there looking for gigs?LEENY OBERG: So it has improved. There's no doubt. We actually ended the quarter with about 5,000 job openings, still a lot. I know. But you compare that to pre-COVID, actually was 6,300. So actually, we're in fine shape.We are seeing the turnover rates calm down. We're seeing the interest in the industry pick back up. So I would say a much steadier environment.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there something that needs to be done to get people into these jobs? New training, new approaches to get them into this industry? Because really, this industry, you could start on the bottom and very easily work your way to the top over the course of 10, 20, 30 years.LEENY OBERG: It's one of my favorite things about our industry, is that it is all about the people and all about the way they work together. And it is a classic apprenticeship industry where you absolutely--I think about so many of the top leaders of the company and they overwhelmingly started in positions like bellman, or front desk associates, or restaurant associates. And now lead huge parts of the company. So it's a wonderful thing to see.But when you think about kind of what we're doing for the associates, I think the answer is we always want to try to be doing more. It's a core tenet of who we are. Take care of your associates and they'll take care of your guests.But if you think about some of the work that went on last year, increased our match on 401(k), started an employee stock purchase plan, really looked hard at labor scheduling opportunities that now are done through an app that's much easier to say, you know what?Next week because I've got something going on with my family, I really can only work two days while this week I can work six. A lot more flexibility.BRIAN SOZZI: Leeny, you really have major street cred. Longtime CFO of Marriott. You're on that Adobe board. Really a decorated Adobe board. What are some of the biggest challenges executives like yourself are up against right now?LEENY OBERG: I would say the one that I probably spend the most time on is speed of change. And obviously, technology has a huge amount to do with that.And when you think about how rapidly you see new apps come and go, new businesses come and go, new tech, you know, AI, all the things that are going on with generative AI, it really does reinforce how quickly companies need to be able to adapt.And we're a big ship. We are a big company. And we're working really hard to be as nimble as we can. Looking at our markets, looking at our technology, and really excited about what we see going forward.BRIAN SOZZI: Does this new technology change the role of CFO? Because in the near term, you have to meet these results, you have to meet Wall Street expectations.But you know, you hear all this new technology and all these investments you might have to make just to do well 10 years from now, I mean, it has to make things more complicated.LEENY OBERG: Well, one of the things I really have always loved about the CFO role is the intersection between business strategy and capital.And at the end of the day, that is really what it's all about, is devising business strategies that are going to allow you to achieve for your consumer and for your associates what you want.But then thinking about the best way to do that. What is the way that will generate the best returns that allows you to access that capital to make them successful.And it is where those things intersect that, frankly, are no different than they were 10 years ago. The topics may be a little bit different. Technology clearly is only a bigger part of that conversation. But at the same time, it's really all about trying to be successful in your business strategy.]"

297,833830a0-cc9e-3f5a-8581-2a74606b8b21,MAR,2023-08-02,Marriott’s Premium Brands Are Driving Results. Now It’s Adding Midscale Hotels.,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-premium-brands-driving-results-153904505.html,1690904344,STORY,['MAR'],"[JW Marriott Goa's pool. Source: Marriott International.One under-recognized reason Marriott International raised its 2023 outlook for profitability on Tuesday was that its hotels are nearly all premium or better.The vacationers, road warriors, and group meeting planners who can afford its properties were relatively insulated from economic concerns in the past year compared to the population as a whole.So it’s counterintuitive that the hotelier’s strategy is to expand its share of more affordable hotels — which presumably would expose it to more swings in demand.Marriott’s Robust QuarterThe world’s largest hotelier reported strong second-quarter performance.The Bethesda, Maryland-based company boosted its net income 7% to $726 million from a year earlier.It raised its full-year forecast for net income to at least $2.63 billion.Its revenue rose about 16% to approximately $1.6 billion after deducting the revenue it collected and passed back to its managed and franchised properties.The company saw operational strength across its portfolio.Marriott’s revenue per available room — a key industry figure — rose 13.5% from a year earlier.The company boosted its average worldwide pricing by 6% year-over-year.“In the U.S. and Canada, leisure revenues rose 1% above last year’s sensational second quarter,” said president and CEO Anthony Capuano. “Demand in this market has been stabilizing on a year-over-year basis with travelers from the region increasingly taking vacations overseas now that pandemic-related travel restrictions are behind us.”“As we look into the third quarter, the consumer is generally holding up well, and our forward bookings remain solid,” said chief financial officer Kathleen Oberg.Growing Interest in Midscale HotelsNearly all of Marriott’s more than 30 brands are premium or above, ranging from Courtyard to The Ritz-Carlton. This year Marriott has taken steps to add more affordable hotels one or two tiers down. Called “midscale,” this category means hotels that are fancier than “economy” while still being “affordable.”Story continuesIn May, the company officially absorbed City Express, a midscale brand.In June, Marriott announced an extended stay brand in the “affordable midscale” category in North America.In July, the company revealed a licensing deal with MGM Resorts that will make rooms at 17 MGM resorts bookable via its site and app by year-end. Many of the properties have midscale offerings. “It’s not just some sort of loyalty lockup,” Capuano said. “It’s structured to look a lot more like a franchise agreement.”On Tuesday, Marriott suggested it would make a midscale push in Europe. “We’re excited about what we see as the possibility for a conversion mid-scale brand in EMEA [Europe and the Middle East region] and look forward to some announcements in the back half of the year regarding that,” Capuano said.To be sure, the company has the Fairfield Inn brand in the midscale category, with more than 1,000 properties. But Fairfield is in the “upper” midscale segment.“Marriott is clearly sending a message they want to play more of a role in the midscale market, which signifies an evolution of how they are thinking about their brands,” wrote analysts at Melius Research in a report on Monday.Fairfield by Marriott Inn &amp; Suites Denver Tech Center NorthA couple of factors drive Marriott’s new fascination with midscale hotels.The earnings Marriott generates for adding each additional hotel exceeds the marginal cost, on average.So investors are eager to see Marriott sustain a fast-growing pipeline of new properties because that implies a predictable rise in earnings.Marriott’s footprint growth remains brisk in the short term. On Tuesday, the company forecasted it would grow its net rooms this year by between 6.4% and 6.7%Yet long-term Marriott faces stiff competition from rivals like Hilton, Accor, IHG, and Hyatt when it comes to acquiring more supply of premium hotels. Over time, growth is getting harder to find, relatively speaking. So the company wants to move “downscale” to sustain its footprint growth.Another factor driving Marriott’s interest is that midscale properties are popular with developers, investors, and owners. Midscale properties tend to cost relatively less to operate, and lenders tend to be quicker to finance them, than more elaborate projects.Ironic Strategy for its Hotel Pipeline?There’s something of an irony in Marriott’s move modestly downscale. The more it adds “affordable” properties to the mix, the more exposed it will become to travelers who are less resilient in economic downturns.Yet it’s been precisely because Marriott’s customer base has been disproportionately more financially robust that the hotelier has been able to outperform many other types of businesses in the post-pandemic recovery. Marriott’s stock price last week hit an all-time high, having rallied 18.6% over the past few months, while the S&amp;P 500 index has risen only 10%.Suppose Marriott succeeds in diversifying its customer base by adding more affordable hotels. In that case, it will expose itself more to the volatility of travel buyers whose booking patterns are linked to macroeconomic trends. In the next economic downturn, its fortunes might not prove as resilient.But that’s tomorrow’s problem.Or perhaps it won’t be a problem. Expect that Marriott executives will make a case to investors during a day of presentations on September 27 about why they believe they will be able, over time, to convert customers who enter the Marriott system by staying at affordable hotels to “trade up” to pricier properties during repeat stays.Many investors won’t care whether Marriott’s strategic shift toward adding more midscale properties creates complications in the future. They’ll have pocketed any potential price gains thanks to an expected short-term earnings boost from hotel development growth and can move on if necessary years from now. Marriott Vs.

299,1c9789f1-a5af-3a63-9b7a-fafd22a9c05f,MAR,2023-08-02,"What JetBlue, Marriott earnings reveal about the consumer",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/jetblue-mariott-earnings-reveal-consumer-141743854.html,1690899463,VIDEO,"['AXP', 'MAR', 'NCLH', 'JBLU']","[Americans are looking to travel, but internationally. JetBlue is the latest domestic carrier to warn that consumers are spending less on domestic air travel. The shift to international travel is helping Marriott International though. The company's second-quarter results got a boost from international spending. As Roundhill Investments Chief Strategy Officer David Mazza tells Yahoo Finance Live ""we are seeing bifurcation at the individual company level.""Video Transcript- That brings us to our next subject, which is travel. And in particular, JetBlue. We're getting a read on the consumer and where they're traveling in a number of different travel earnings reports. JetBlue shares are up by 7%. The company slashed its outlook for the rest of the year and attributing that move to a shift toward international travel.It is more domestically oriented. It also lost its partnership with American Airlines. We also heard from some other travel companies, though, where things do look better. Marriott, for example, also reported that company beating estimates. But the shares are trading a little down, and Norwegian Cruise Line raising its earnings per share forecast for the full year.But those shares are getting punished too. So go figure. We'll see. Maybe there's some other stuff in there that is causing all of that. Dave Mazza is still with us-- Roundhill Investments Chief Strategy Officer. I know you travel quite a bit because you're based in LA. So you're flying back and forth.So it's interesting to hear what-- to see what looks like anecdotally, a travel boom all around us. And yet, it's not necessarily helping all of the travel companies equally.DAVID MAZZA: Yeah, no. Really some interesting tidbits here. So I was actually traveling on vacation a few weeks ago to Europe. Packed flights, packed hotels, couldn't get around. When I traveled most recently domestically, pretty light.And I think this is perhaps indicative of what we saw out of JetBlue most recently. Alaska also is in that camp compared to perhaps something coming out of Marriott, or even news of United creating all these mega routes, you know?Story continuesI've been on a plane for over 16 hours, but they're signing up all these 20-hour flights and everything of that nature. And what's interesting is, again, we are seeing bifurcation at the individual company level.I think JetBlue, of course, also hurt by issues with the Northeast-- Northeast Alliance that was broken up. And then-- and then the requirement like other airlines to pull back on some of this Northeast travel due to limited air traffic controllers.But again, it tells us that I think we need to be careful when we see pictures of packed airports or social media saying everything is fine. Those tickets were probably booked weeks ago or months ago.And so people are looking out and saying, hey, I'm more concerned. Well, what's going to happen around Thanksgiving or the holidays this year looking ahead? And that I think we might start to see a pullback. American Express released earnings a few weeks ago, another sort of bellwether for the consumer.Something fascinating to me came out of that, saying, they're starting to see evidence. Again, these are folks with considerable incomes who have platinum cards and the like, pulling back on some hotel and airfare, but increasing spending at restaurants both for takeout and in-person.So-- so to me, that's a sign. Again, early sign that maybe, again, there is some of a pullback of some of these big-ticket spending. But people are still feeling pretty good. They want to get out of the house, want to go to a nice dinner. So that's where they're spending as opposed to booking that-- that vacation around the holidays or to Europe next year.BRAD SMITH: Which is really interesting considering American Express saying that, but has a little bit more exposure to the corporate side too of spending. Meanwhile, you've got MasterCard that came out last week that was essentially saying, yeah, travel spending is still looking strong here. That really giving a lot of credence to what we had been hearing from some of those travel CEOs.Speaking of travel, let's talk a little more accommodations here. Opposite over at Marriott here, when we think about the company out with earnings this morning, lifting their outlook on demand for international travel and international revenue coming in better than expected in the second quarter for Marriott. They also added over 33,000 rooms globally during the second quarter here.We want to get your perspective around Marriott and the accommodation space as of right now, as travel continues to at least show no signs of slowing down immediately. But at the same time, you've got to think about how much all of these companies are spending to either bring on more capacity or just to retain that consumer too.DAVID MAZZA: Yeah. I think, again, overall theme is for now. And again, this has helped the economy in aggregate this year. Excuse me-- has been there, has been resiliency of the consumer. Resiliency of the American consumer that has propelled certain companies higher. Marriott is a great example of that. And particularly noting on that international side.So it's fascinating is that on the travel side, companies with greater international exposure are benefiting. But then to your point, in aggregate companies, perhaps in the-- other types of consumers are actually not being rewarded as much. In fact, because their earnings are-- are not as robust for other reasons.So again, American consumers bringing cash overseas, spending more there, benefiting companies exposed. But perhaps we're seeing companies and local sort of Europeans or folks living in Asia, not spending as much, not confident as much.BRAD SMITH: And on that note, we also should note for our viewers out there, don't miss Yahoo Finance's interview with Marriott's CFO, Leeny Oberg, that's coming up later today in the three o'clock hour.]"
300,1308da4a-385a-3025-80af-9500963561b9,KLAC,2023-08-02,Why You Should Care About KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) Strong Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-care-klas-nasdaq-klac-110112599.html,1690974072,STORY,['KLAC'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), we liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for KLA, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.39 = US$4.0b ÷ (US$14b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Therefore, KLA has an ROCE of 39%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for KLA roceIn the above chart we have measured KLA's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for KLA.So How Is KLA's ROCE Trending?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like KLA. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 39% and the business has deployed 133% more capital into its operations. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.The Key TakeawayKLA has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 375% return to those who've held over the last five years.

However, more times than not, many amateur investors fail to understand that there is often a good reason for the low price, such as poor fundamentals or slowing earnings growth.In a value trap, though the price seems low already, the fundamental issues continue to erode value over time, though they once appeared to be a bargain. Avoiding value traps requires an investor to look beyond a low valuation ratio and consider other factors.Here are signs you may be in a value trap:The Company Has ""Caretaker Management""When a company has a long and successful past, management may fall into the ""caretaker"" trap. In other words, the company has so much cash on hand, and executives get paid such large salaries that there is little motivation to grow the business. For example, in 2022, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey hauled in more than $20 million in total compensation. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T's EPS fell from 2.63 to 2.57 per share during the same time. In fact, AT&amp;T's earnings have stagnated for years.Stick to companies that are constantly innovating, such as Apple. Though Apple is a massive company, management is always searching for opportunities. Since 2016, AAPL has nearly tripled its annual EPS by innovating and unveiling new products such as the Apple Watch and the wildly popular AirPods. In the long run, the price of a stock is directly correlated to earnings growth.Dividends May Lure You In Stocks like Verizon pay healthy dividends (7.7%). While a 7.7% dividend may be attractive to income-focused investors, investors need to remember that dividends are not paid out in a vacuum. In other words, if a stock is plummeting, even a high dividend will not lead you to profitability. For example, though Verizon's dividend has increased over the past five years, the stock is down 42%.Story continuesNot only would you be lagging if you were in a stock like VZ over that period, you would also have the added insult of injury of opportunity cost. For instance, the Nasdaq 100 is up 44.3% over the same time.GARP Is the SolutionA GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) Strategy can help investors avoid value traps by balancing growth potential and valuation. Warren Buffett holding Occidental Petroleum is a great example – the company has a history of strong earnings growth and a reasonable valuation.ConclusionSometimes, when you pay for a ""cheap stock,"" you get what you pay for. Caretaker management, slow growth, and the wrong environment could mean you're in a classic ""value trap."" Use a GARP strategy to balance growth and value and get the best of both worlds.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

NEW YORK, Aug. 01, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon’s network is once again the network to beat for performance, accessibility and reliability in a majority of 125 metro markets tested by RootMetrics®. In these rigorous and scientific network tests, Verizon’s network is undefeated in 97% of the metro drive tests (121 out of 125 markets) they performed in the first half of 2023. And if customers are interested in accessing the network quickly while on the go, Verizon is undefeated in the category of network accessibility in 85% of the markets tested (106 out of 125). Verizon is also undefeated in 93% of the metro markets (116 out of 125) when it comes to network reliability.* These tests, with data accumulated over several months, show a pattern of exceptional performance for customers who live and travel throughout the US.“Customers rely on Verizon’s network everyday and we take that responsibility very seriously,” said Joe Russo, EVP and President, Global Network and Technology at Verizon. “Our engineers are maniacal about ensuring exceptional network performance, and our team works tirelessly to ensure our customers have a robust, secure, fast, and consistent experience with us when and where they need it.”Verizon is not slowing downThroughout the first half of the year, the network team has made major upgrades in the metro areas tested.Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. Today more than 200 million people have access to Verizon’s 5G service and that number is growing everyday.Many of these deployments used Verizon’s  recently acquired C-band spectrum, designed to provide wide coverage for 5G service. Last year, months ahead of schedule, Verizon received access to additional C-band spectrum which it has been deploying aggressively across the country. This year, Verizon will gain access to the remainder of the spectrum they purchased in the auction doubling, and in some cases tripling, the amount of bandwidth available to serve customers.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Even as engineers provide wireless service in more places, they are also enhancing the service by deploying leading edge, modernized technology in many areas. In states across the country, Engineers have upgraded the hardware in many of the cell sites adding capacity for more data to be used by customers, providing power efficiency, and providing virtualization. This technology milestone allows Verizon to rapidly respond to customers’ varied latency and computing needs, and provides greater flexibility and agility in the introduction of new products and services. The move to a cloud-based, virtualized architecture with standardized interfaces in every part of the network leads to greater flexibility, faster delivery of services, greater scalability, and improved cost efficiency in networks.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections across the nation so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Story continuesIn addition to making 5G more accessible to more people, Verizon continues to focus on building out the advanced technologies that provide robust security, reliability and customized experiences for customers.  Those advancements include fully deploying the 5G core with Verizon’s proprietary cloud platform built specifically for telco workloads, advancing the fiber network to handle expected exponential increases in data traffic, continuing massive virtualization of the network to add programmability and flexibility into the network, using artificial intelligence to drive reliability and performance, continuing to develop edge computing capabilities to drive down latency, and continuing to advance antenna configurations to drive speed and efficiency.*Rankings based on the RootMetrics® metro RootScore® Reports for 125 metro areas: Tested with best commercially available smartphones on three mobile networks across all available network types.

Network upgrades in Harrisburg include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities.

Stanley Black &amp; Decker's second quarter performance represented strong execution across the organization, driving significant progress towards our business transformation objectives on multiple fronts. Before I get into the results, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Chris Nelson to our leadership team, and we have him joining us on the call for Q&amp;A today. Chris started in June as our Chief Operating Officer and President of our Tools &amp; Outdoor business. Chris is an experienced global business leader with strong industry knowledge and a successful track record of implementing growth strategies which have delivered customer-centric innovation and profitable market share expansion. I am excited to see Chris assume leadership of the Tools &amp; Outdoor business. He is bringing new energy and perspective which will further position us for strong execution and faster profitable growth. Welcome, Chris. With this critical appointment, Stanley Black &amp; Decker's senior leadership team is now in place. Together, we will bring our shared vision to life, optimizing the company around our core businesses and strong portfolio of global brands as we execute our strategy to generate sustainable growth and margin expansion. As you will hear from Pat in a few moments, our cost and supply chain optimization program is ahead of plan through the first 6 months of 2023 and building momentum. The compelling long-term growth opportunities in the markets we serve, combined with the progress we've made transforming our business, including our improved cost position, gives us the confidence to pursue further growth investments in the second half of this year. Deploying these growth investments as part of our $300 million to $500 million target over the next 3 years is intended to accelerate market share gains. As we drive these investment priorities, we are also maintaining our commitment to return value to our shareholders. And to that end, our Board of Directors approved a modest increase to our quarterly cash dividend, amounting to $0.81 per share. Shifting now to our second quarter performance. We demonstrated that we are continuing to advance our transformation journey and ahead of the planned program. Specifically, we reduced inventory by nearly $400 million in Q2, which brings our aggregate program to-date reduction to $1.4 billion since mid-2022. Our global cost reduction program delivered $230 million of pretax run rate savings in the quarter, on track for the expected $1 billion of annualized savings by the end of this year. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 23.6%, a sequential improvement of 50 basis points, our second consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And all of these actions translated into $200 million of free cash flow in Q2. Second quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, which was down versus the prior year due to lower consumer outdoor and DIY volume, as rising interest rates have tempered consumer spending in addition to the negative year-over-year impact of the oil and gas divestiture completed last year. That said, demand remains solid for the professional side of the market, which represents roughly 70% of our tools business. As it relates to the end markets, the U.S. retail point of sale for our tools and outdoor products remained in a growth position this quarter versus 2019 levels, bolstered by price and healthy pro demand. Both tools and outdoor POS through the first 4 weeks of July is growing versus prior year, a potentially positive signal for the back half of 2023. We are also encouraged by a stabilizing residential construction market despite the rising interest rate cycle. U.S. home starts are running at a pace of 1.4 million units in June, a strong signal that demand for housing remains sound. This is complemented by U.S. permits to build single-family homes rising to a 1-year high and positive trends in housing completions. Additionally, contractor backlog in the U.S. remains healthy for repair and remodel activity. The European markets are experiencing similar trends with softer DIY markets balanced with a healthier level of construction activity and professionals with backlogs through the end of this year. And then finally, our channel partners continue to be focused on optimizing inventory levels. And we expect that to be a modest headwind throughout 2023. Across our industrial end markets, we are seeing continued strength in global automotive and aerospace. So while the end markets across Stanley Black &amp; Decker remain relatively stable with pockets of strength, we are monitoring the demand environment and continue to plan for a range of outcomes and will respond accordingly if we see current trends shift. Operationally, we continue to be focused on the prioritization of inventory reduction and cash generation, with 2Q adjusted diluted EPS coming in at a loss of $0.11, which was better than our plan. Due to the solid progress we have made on our key financial goals in the first half, we are narrowing our 2023 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $0.70 up to $1.30; and narrowing our free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million. Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. Now let me walk through the details of our business segment performance. Beginning with Tools &amp; Outdoor, total revenue was $3.5 billion, down 5% organically versus prior year as favorable price realization was more than offset by volume decline. We continue to make progress on the Tools &amp; Outdoor adjusted operating margin, which was 4.5%, up 150 basis points sequentially driven by benefits from volume leverage and cost control. Versus prior year, our operating margin rate was down as price realization was more than offset by selling through high-cost inventory, planned production curtailment costs and lower volume. I would now like to provide some more detail on our various Tools &amp; Outdoor geographies. North America was down mid-single digits organically, weighted by lower consumer outdoor and DIY tool demand as well as modest customer destocking. Organic revenues were stronger sequentially as we lapped tougher comparables and saw benefits from better order fill rates with our customers while leveraging strength and professional demand. Our European revenue was down 1% organically, with bright spots in the U.K. and Southern regions as they both posted high single-digit organic growth. The emerging markets performance was down 3% organically. However, when you exclude the impact from our Russian business exit, the remaining countries had high single-digit organic growth. This was led by strong demand in Brazil, particularly within the professional channels.Moving to our strategic business unit performance. We experienced an outdoor organic revenue decline of 12%. As widely reported by many in this industry, the challenging start to the outdoor season persisted for the entire season, and we did experience notable softness in POS and replenishment in the quarter, especially surrounding higher-price-point retail products. The hand tools business was flat organically versus prior year and overcame softer DIY volume with international growth and certain category strength. Notably, DEWALT's storage solution growth, including the expanded soft line and ToughSystem 2.0 portfolio offerings introduced earlier this year. Power tools declined 4% organically as softer consumer market demand persisted and customers remained cautious with inventory levels. This result was notably better than the first quarter, as we saw continued pro momentum coupled with positive impacts from a healthier supply chain leading to better service levels and increased promotional opportunities, particularly with DEWALT and CRAFTSMAN. Now shifting to our Industrial business, which had 3% organic growth in the quarter. The total segment revenue declined 5% versus 2Q 2022 as price realization was more than offset by last year's oil and gas divestiture and currency. We improved adjusted operating margin by 370 basis points versus prior year, including continued price realization and cost actions, to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13%. This represents strong execution and a great financial outcome this quarter for our Industrial team. Within the segment, Engineered Fastening organic revenues were up 8%, including aerospace growth of 31% and auto growth of 15% as we captured cyclical rebound in these markets along with share gains. This favorable performance was partially offset by industrial fastening and Attachment Tools organic revenue decline primarily as a result of customers destocking to optimize their inventory levels. While long-term fundamentals for growth remain solid, we believe temporary channel inventory reductions will continue to impact these industrial businesses in the second half of the year as well. In summary, the team continues to navigate market conditions with several pockets of strength and a few areas of pressure while we continue to improve our margins. I want to thank the entire Stanley Black &amp; Decker organization, for your focus on our key priorities. The progress to date is very encouraging and energizing as we take the next several steps of our business transformational journey. Turning to the next slide, I would like to underscore the importance of the strategy that we launched a year ago to transform Stanley Black &amp; Decker to accelerate market share gains and drive consistent organic growth. Our teams around the world are gaining traction and executing on our primary areas of focus: one, streamlining and simplifying the organization as well as shifting resources to prioritize investments that we believe have a positive and more direct impact for our end users and various channel customers; two, accelerating the operations and supply chain transformation to return adjusted gross margins to historical 35%-plus levels while improving fill rates to better match inventory with customer demand; three, prioritizing cash flow generation and inventory optimization; and four, continuing to advance innovation, electrification and global market penetration to achieve organic growth of 2 to 3x the market. Our business transformation is our path to continuing to enhance our customer and end user experiences while delivering on our financial commitments and enabling the pursuit of strategic growth investments behind our iconic brands, innovation engine, electrification and commercial activation. Key investments in innovation coupled with market activation are being accelerated to maximize the impact of our product launches with our global customers and end users. For example, our fully integrated CRAFTSMAN campaign was built to drive traffic to our key retail partners, incent repeat purchases and engage new users. To date, we've shown strong initial results breaking through the industry clutter. Since the campaign launched in the second quarter, we've driven both online and off-line traffic to retail and demonstrated improved tools point-of-sale run rate versus the prior year to support brand market share growth. We're excited to see continued positive momentum from this exciting CRAFTSMAN brand campaign. We are also leveraging the strength of our DEWALT brand with a pro-inspired product road map to expand core innovation as we release enhanced product offerings to improve the end user experience. We recently launched 2 new DEWALT sealed head ratchets, the 20-volt MAX XR as well as the XTREME 12V MAX options, delivering power, versatility and durability. Engineered with the professional in mind, particularly automotive, electrical and mechanical trades people, the innovative design meets the needs of pros across industries on any job site. The new DEWALT 20V MAX XR brushless, cordless rivet tools were also introduced this quarter. Designed for precision fastening and prefabrication, assembly, HVAC, roofing and automotive applications. These tools have features such as onboard nosepiece storage and a mandrel collector to catch rivets after each shot. Lastly, we introduced a new DEWALT 25-foot LED tape measure, a great example of core innovation within our ToughSeries product line. Our engineering team continues to advance our innovation road map with best-in-class products and solutions for our end users as we electrify and enhance safety on the job site as well as push the bounds of power and performance across our categories. Let me now turn the call over to Pat to share the latest progress updates on our transformation, financial insights on the quarter and our latest outlook.Patrick D. HallinanThank you, and good morning, everyone. As Don mentioned, we made meaningful progress on our transformation in the quarter and first half of the year. Our cost reduction program is on track to deliver $1 billion of pretax run rate savings in 2023 and is modestly ahead of plan year-to-date. Our simplification and prioritization efforts, coupled with our supply chain transformation, delivered $230 million of run rate savings in the second quarter, totaling $460 million year-to-date and $660 million since program inception. Approximately half of our 2023 savings were manufacturing costs related, and as such, we'll begin to see these benefits turn through inventory off the balance sheet and onto the P&amp;L, starting in the second half and continuing to build in 2024. Our organization is bringing our vision for the supply chain of the future to life with persistent sustainable progress. Strategic sourcing is a major contributor of 2023 savings and is ahead of plan. We have the capabilities in place to ensure changes are executed successfully, and we are currently activating additional RFPs to secure further savings. The momentum behind the SBD Operating Model along with lean manufacturing practices is yielding sustainable productivity efficiencies such as alleviating manufacturing bottlenecks as well as reducing process waste and production downtime. This will become an important source of savings in the coming months and quarters. Our manufacturing and logistics network optimization remains on track as we work to improve the efficiency and utilization of the asset base. Finally, as it relates to our complexity reduction, the SKU rationalization initiative is progressing in an orderly fashion. At this stage, we have approved the reduction of approximately 70,000 SKUs. We are working with our customers to assist with their transition to replacement products over the coming quarters. We have now decommissioned over 20,000 SKUs. We believe that, as we exit the remaining 50,000 offerings, we will have suitable substitutes that will mitigate effectively all of the potential revenue risk, which we size at less than $50 million annually. We believe managing this in a methodical way creates value via complexity reduction without undue disruption to our customers or loss of share. We are pleased with the progress of our global cost reduction program and are confident in our ability to capture $1 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2023 and $2 billion of run rate savings by the end of 2025. Turning to our inventory reduction progress and gross margin trajectory. In the second quarter, we reduced inventory by $375 million, bringing our year-to-date progress to $575 million. Over the last 12 months, we've achieved approximately $1.4 billion in inventory reduction through the improved supply chain conditions and planned production curtailments instituted during the back half of 2022. To contextualize our first half performance, the $575 million reduction compares favorably to the average pre-pandemic first half inventory build of approximately $400 million. We are expecting our full year 2023 inventory reduction to be between $700 million and $900 million, which represents a DSI that is about 155 days. We remain committed to ongoing inventory productivity improvement to generate cash flow that will be used to strengthen our balance sheet while supporting our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends. Turning to gross margin. The pace of improvement has been modestly ahead of expectations as transformation execution and freight deflation are favorable to plan. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 23.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter of 2023. The impact from liquidating high-cost inventory and the production curtailments represented approximately 400 to 500 basis points of margin headwinds in the second quarter. Moving forward, we expect continued sequential improvement in adjusted gross margin driven by a lower impact from turning high-cost inventory and an increased benefit as our cost transformation improves the P&amp;L. Assuming the demand levels and other assumptions that underpin our guidance, we expect adjusted gross margin to be 27% to 29% in the second half, a strong improvement versus recent quarters. While this is a significant step up from the front half performance, we have line of sight into the cost savings already generated and on the balance sheet. That corresponds to lower cost of sales and margin improvement in the coming quarters. To conclude, we're starting to reap the benefits from the inventory reductions and supply chain transformation, and we remain focused on delivering our targeted adjusted gross margin of 35-plus percent by 2025. Now turning to 2023 guidance. Our expected GAAP earnings per share range has been narrowed to negative $1.25 to negative $0.50 from negative $1.65 to positive $0.60, inclusive of onetime charges primarily from the global supply chain transformation and outdoor integration. The current pretax charges estimate was narrowed to $300 million to $325 million, with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash. The 2023 quarterly profile of GAAP taxes and GAAP earnings per share is significantly impacted by the pretax loss in the first half and the interim tax impact of certain benefits factored into our annual effective tax rate assumption. However, as we expect to generate pretax income in the second half, this interim tax benefit will reverse. And we expect our full year tax rate to be relatively consistent with prior guidance. In parallel, we are also narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $0.70 to $1.30 from a previous guidance range of $0 to $2. We are keeping the $1 midpoint consistent with the prior guidance framework. Versus our previous expectation, we have assumed modestly lower organic growth offset by better gross margin. At the midpoint, this results in an improved full year adjusted operating profit and margin. This stronger operating performance is offset by an approximate $0.25 impact from higher interest and other expenses below the line, of which 40% to 50% is interest rate-driven. We are narrowing our full year free cash flow range to $600 million to $900 million from $500 million to $1 billion. We expect second half cash flow to be supported by positive net income, a further reduction in inventory and the normal Tools &amp; Outdoor seasonal benefit from working capital. We are planning for total company organic growth to be down mid-single digits for the year. In terms of the business segment outlook, Tools &amp; Outdoor total organic revenue is expected to be down mid- to high single digits for the year. Incorporating the softer outlook in outdoor as well as expectations for continued DIY softness and channel inventory conservatism, we are expecting to regain cordless power tool promotions in the second half, reflecting our improved supply position. And as such, pricing is assumed to be relatively flat to slightly negative, consistent with these activities. We continue to see the pro tool user holding strong. And at this point, we believe the range of outcomes for volume covers some variability for the U.S. consumer and DIY demand balanced with the potential for stronger professional demand in the back half. In Industrial, we expect flat to low single-digit organic growth on a full year basis supported by cyclical rebound in aerospace and auto. This is modestly lower than our prior outlook as we incorporate an assumption for continued customer destocking in Attachment Tools and industrial fastening. Production normalization and the pace of growth investments will both be flexed based on demand. We are planning for production to normalize in the fourth quarter, recognizing the lower volumes. We remain disciplined and flexible in our approach to reinvesting to drive organic growth. Our focus is to deliver on our financial expectations while utilizing gross margin improvements to fund growth investments. Our outlook assumes approximately $125 million of annualized investments, with a goal to ultimately deploy $300 million to $500 million over the next 3 years. Clearly our willingness to invest increases as we progress along our gross margin expansion trajectory. We expect second half adjusted operating margins to be in the mid- to high single digits as our cost efficiencies offset volume pressures. Turning to the important remaining elements of guidance. The expectation for the third quarter would be a sequential improvement in operating profit, primarily from the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and a lesser impact from destocking. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter is planned to be approximately 80% of the full year adjusted EPS amount. And due to losses within the first half, the back half adjusted EPS will be more than 100% of the full year total adjusted EPS. So in summary, we are exiting the first half with strong momentum across our cost savings and cash generation initiatives. With some of the more significant impacts from our inventory reductions now in the rearview mirror, we are focusing on driving the items within our control to deliver further margin improvement and to fund investment. We continue to manage the business with the long term in mind, and we believe we have the right strategy in place to successfully navigate our path forward as we remain focused on driving above-market organic growth with margin expansion and enhanced shareholder returns. With that, I will now pass the call back over to Don.Donald AllanThank you, Pat. We are pleased to report another quarter of meaningful progress related to our transformation journey. Successful execution against our plans gives us the confidence to increase our focus on reinvestment towards faster growth as we fuel our team with more resources to unleash the power of our amazing brands, strengthen the innovation machine and stimulate demand with enhanced end user activation. We believe our actions to reshape, focus and streamline our organization as well as reinvest in our core businesses will enable us to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term via robust organic growth and enhanced profitability. I am proud to be alongside the best people, the best brands and the most powerful innovation engine in our industry. As we continue to focus on what we could control to be successful, I am confident that we are recreating a significant market share-gaining machine. With that, we are now ready for Q&amp;A, Dennis.Dennis M. LangeGreat. Thanks, Don. Shannon, we can now start Q&amp;A, please. Thank you.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.Timothy Ronald WojsAt risk of being yelled at, I'm going to try to ask a two-parter. So I guess, the first question, just as you're looking at gross margins kind of first half to second half, if, Pat, maybe you could give us some color on the bridge in terms of how you go from kind of low 23s in the first half to that 27% to 29% in the back half. How much of that is production versus some of the cost savings that you're seeing there? And then I guess, second, since we've got Chris on the call, maybe just hoping to get a little bit of his kind of early thoughts and observations since he's gotten into the business.Patrick D. HallinanYes, I'll start, Tim, with gross margin. It's a meaningful step up, but it's an important part of our journey. And we're confident in delivering it for the back half of this year. A big chunk of it is the roll off of high-cost inventory. I'd say the bridge from roughly a 23%, 24% up to a 28-ish number is about 100 points of production curtailment fading away slightly. And the balance is a mix of both cost savings generated by our transformation and a dissipation of the high-cost inventory of the past, probably equal parts of each in that regard.Christopher John NelsonThis is Chris. Tim, thanks for the question. And I just wanted to start by saying how honored I am to join Don and the entire Stanley Black &amp; Decker leadership team to help bring the company's long-term strategic vision of accelerated organic growth to life. As you well know, Don and the team have made meaningful progress on this ambitious plan; and I'm just grateful for the opportunity to help drive the company's transformation forward. As I've come onboard, as you might expect, it's been a lot of taking time to learn and listen. And I've got to say, it's been quite a whirlwind thus far in the first 6-ish weeks. Been 7 factories, spent at least a day with every major business unit, going through market trends, the products, the product road maps for the future. Been to all the key design centers in North America and had several key customer meetings. And through this process, what I'd say is that 3 real key observations and opportunities stand out. First is the long-term commercial opportunities exist due to the impressive strength of Stanley Black &amp; Decker's brands and products. Simply put, our customers really, really like our products and our brands; and want to grow with us. And that's something that cannot be underestimated for the future. Secondly is that the innovation engine within Stanley Black &amp; Decker is amazing, and I do believe it is a differentiating capability. Our ability to start with work with the end user to understand their environment as well as the issues that they are trying to solve and then rapidly be able to turn that into the design and implementation of products and solutions to help our customers solve their problems and become more efficient is really going to be an important future catalyst for growth. And then third is, as I've been out and spent time in the factories and in the operations, seeing the amount of traction that exists on the operations and supply chain transformation, there are obviously real benefits accruing through the P&amp;L., and Pat referenced those earlier. But as importantly, I can see the foundation that is putting -- being put in place that will make this a sustainable and long-term opportunity for the company. And it's also clear that the -- that there's ample future runway and that we're in the early innings of the transformation, and that the future savings will be able to be reinvested back in the business to continue to fuel growth as well as margin expansion. So really, the combination of these 3 key observations and opportunities really -- it has me very excited as far as the opportunity for long-term value creation within Stanley Black &amp; Decker.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian C.H. MitchellWelcome to Chris. Maybe just my question was -- understood just now that bridge from first half to second half of this year, but just wanted to check on any color you could give on the bridge from this year as a whole into next. And I suppose, if we look at your second half guidance for this year, it's about, including some sort of outdoor seasonality assumption, it's maybe $3.50 of annualized EPS based off your second half guide at the midpoint. You had talked about a $5-ish EPS for next year previously, so I just wondered sort of any updated thoughts on that EPS step-up into 2024. And sort of related to that, it looks like your inventories will still be well above historical norms at the end of December, but you talk about production normalization during Q4, so I just wanted to sort of square that away when thinking about next year.Donald AllanThank you for the questions. And I'll kick it off and then pass it over to Pat for a little more detail as far as our perspective on next year. We have talked about in previous calls a $5 -- or a $4 to $5 range for 2024 for EPS. Given what we're seeing in the back half and what we're currently projecting for revenues, the improvement in the gross margins, we're making some investments in SG&amp;A that will plant some seeds for future share gain activity. We do think we're positioning ourselves to be in that $4 to $5 for next year, depending on a couple of factors. Does the revenue maintain itself or grow? Or do we see continued pressure due to economic reasons? And how much more investment do we want to do to really drive that share gain opportunity across the globe? Those are questions that we'll figure out in the back half of the year. And when we provide guidance in early '24, we'll give more insight, but we think we've built a foundation that allows us to achieve that range I mentioned. I'll pass the inventory portion of the question over to Pat and let him give you a little more sense of where we think we are in the journey of inventory and where we go from here.Patrick D. HallinanYes, Julian, I'll pick up where Don left off. I think, from an operating performance and productivity range, we're targeting towards that EPS level, but as Don said, as we get to next year's guidance, we'll look at the macro and we'll look at our investment level for long-term growth. And I think that will decide our EPS for next year. In terms of gross margin this year and into next year, following on that opening question, we can really already see on our balance sheet and already in our savings rhythm the gross margin levels that we're projecting for the back half of this year. So those rates of gross margin delivery are, for the most part, on our balance sheet already for this year. And then your question around how do we step that into next year. Think of every one of the next few years going through the end of 2025 as $500 million incremental of COGS savings off of our revenue base. You're talking 200 to 300 basis points a calendar year of gross margin improvement. And so we continue to track on our long-term cost transformation. And so we finished this year at 28%-ish gross margin in the back half of the year, you could kind of expect that 200-plus basis point level of gross margin improvement to be carried into next year. And that's the kind of momentum you should be expecting the next couple years. In terms of inventory, we're going to make significant inventory progress this year. But you're correct to point out that by the time we get to the end of this year, our absolute inventory dollars at the end of this year will be in the $5 billion-ish range, which is around 155 days-ish range, which is higher than our long-term history of inventory levels, which have obviously changed since we acquired an outdoors business from the legacy Stanley Black &amp; Decker levels but still below 155. We'll continue to make progress and we'll talk about that more specifically when we give guidance for next year. But we will continue to make progress and be working towards a level that is below 150 across a multi -- or rather below 140 across a multiyear time horizon. Next year, our progress will be balanced against some of our network changes. We are bringing online some new DCs next year and a new DC footprint altogether. So while we'll make some progress next year, it will be balanced against some of the long-term decisions we're making to improve service and costs in our DC footprint.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.Nigel Edward CoeI'll try and make this question a bit punchier. And Chris, welcome. Good to meet you. So the EPS, $0.80 for -- well, $0.80 roughly for 3Q midpoint, and so I think it implies 4Q down slightly. So just wondering how we should think about that gross margin cadence between 3Q and 4Q. I'd have thought that maybe some of the cost benefits would benefit 4Q more than 3Q, so just -- maybe just run through that. And then the comment about pricing, flat to slightly negative, is that for the whole corporation? Or is that just specifically for Tools &amp; Outdoor segment?Patrick D. HallinanYes, Nigel, I'd say all you're seeing in 3Q EPS to 4Q is really just the normal seasonal cadence, right? We tend to ship in, in the third quarter a lot of the product that is sold through the holiday season, so it's just a normal cadence that you would see from one quarter to the next. From a gross margin perspective, they'll roughly be even across quarters, if not the fourth quarter being slightly higher, so the margin journey will be on the right momentum track, and all you're seeing in EPS dollars is seasonality. I think in terms of pricing, 85% of our business is Tools &amp; Outdoor. And all you're seeing in pricing is the fact that this year we're back to a normal seasonal promotional cadence, especially around the Black Friday time frame, without new kind of gross price increases offsetting that introduction of -- reintroduction, I should say, of a normal promotional cadence. So it's just the dynamic of us reentering a normal promotional cadence that will potentially take us below flat pricing, but it should be a real small marginal amount. That's all you're seeing with both of those dynamics.Donald AllanAnd just a reminder, recognizing that as we launch new products at new price points throughout the year, the impact of the higher price versus the previous product that it's replacing does not flow through that price line, but it does flow through your margins. So you don't necessarily see the full impact of pricing decisions and processes that we have across the company because of that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.Michael Jason RehautWelcome, Chris. Wanted to dial in a little bit more into the change in your organic growth outlook for Tools &amp; Outdoor. I think you kind of said it was driven by several different factors, softer outlook in outdoor, DIY weakness, channel inventory conservatism. I was hoping if you could kind of bucket those drivers in terms of what's driving the difference, if you can kind of tie it to the difference, I guess, which is maybe 3% or 4% of a change. And also, if -- the POS turning positive, that was kind of part of your prior guidance, because you said it could be a potentially positive signal for the back half. If that continues, would that drive any upside to the guidance?Patrick D. HallinanMike, we obviously had to think of a few moving parts as we outlined the back half of the year. And so I think where I'd start is our primary objective this year is to deliver margin improvement, working capital reduction in cash, obviously. And we want to keep competing in the marketplace. And the second quarter had many dynamics going on. I would say, in the second quarter, we saw consistently weak outdoor, especially for high-price-point items. And we saw the DIY consumer be under a bit more pressure. And on the margin both in Tools &amp; Outdoor and in subsegments of our Industrial business, channel conservancy -- conservatism on inventory. So all of those things were dynamics that played out. We anticipated them in the second quarter. And that's why, when we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, we softened up our revenue expectations on the second quarter, and they played out about as we expected in the quarter. And we thought it best, given the fact that those dynamics have kind of stabilized and stayed with us, for the most part, to play those out in the back half of the year. And that's the adjustment you saw. So almost all the adjustment in the back half of the year was to anticipate a similar level of consumer price sensitivity with winter outdoor goods, a continued DIY consumer softness predominantly in North America and then channel destocking in our infrastructure business. And I'd say they've all been kind of equal drivers of us taking a couple hundred million dollars out of our back half sales forecast, but I'd say the good news is we feel like right now, absent a new macro change, our demand environment has stabilized. And that demand environment has stabilized around a strong pro and really strong aero and automotive in our Industrial business, then I don't think there's any kind of new dynamic with the DIY consumer. Our intent is up for when student loan repayments start around October, but absent that bringing a new macro dynamic into the picture, we feel like our demand outlook has stabilized and we're feeling good about our back half. And then Don referenced there have been some bright spots, things like power tool POS at the very end of the quarter. And we'll see. Those things may emerge, I think, throughout this year given the fed actions. I'd say the broader demand environment has actually surprised us in the sense that it hasn't been more challenging. And so hopefully, those positive trends continue, and if they do, they present upside.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.Christopher M. SnyderI wanted to follow up on the earlier commentary on the bridge into 2024. I understand, if you annualize the back half, you're at $3 EPS, but the back half is a seasonally low point. It feels like if we adjust for seasonality, we're already closer to $4 of annualized EPS. And you guys also said, next year, it sounds like gross margin up maybe in the low 30s versus the high 20s. That's obviously a very significant EPS tailwind. And it feels like that would more than offset the incremental step-up in growth investments. So can you just maybe provide some more color on that?Donald AllanWell, I think what I articulated and Pat added some detail to it -- more robust detail to it is a pretty good summary of where we think we are at this point. And you could build a bullish case that the numbers should be higher for next year, but you do have to factor in the fact that we really want to make sure that we continue to invest in certain key things in our company. We have to get more resources out on the field, closer to our end users. We need to have more engineering resources in key pockets to drive additional innovation opportunities. We've talked about electrification. We want to continue to do that in certain categories that are changing very rapidly. We have to continue to invest in that space. There's more investing we need to do on the digital marketing front, around social media and the activities that we do with our products to really make our end users as fully aware as to the great innovation machine that we have and what we're putting in the marketplace. Those are things that we have to continue to invest in. And so we want to strike the right balance in 2024 of earnings in the sense and cash flow of what's the opportunity for growth as we look at the markets and evaluate that later this year going into 2024. We have a good sense of what's going to happen with gross margins, as Pat articulated. And then the other wildcard is really how much do we want to invest to really plant more seeds for share gain opportunities in the future. That's an important part of our business model that's going to ensure that we're successful for the next several decades, and we want to make sure we do it in the right way and the right level of balance. And that's why we think -- as you think about next year, that range of $4 to $5 probably makes sense. If we change our perspective because of market conditions or how much we want to invest, we'll provide that as soon as possible, but I think it's the right way to think about next year at this stage.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.Nicole Sheree DeBlaseMaybe just a couple of follow-ups from prior questions that were asked. So on pricing, can you just characterize the competitive environment that you're seeing? Anything concerning out there? And then with respect to the channel inventory dynamics in the tools business, I think you guys talked about some channel adjustments this quarter. Is the expectation that, that kind of continues into the back half? Where are your inventories versus where you would like them to be in the channel? That would be great.Donald AllanSure. So I'll take the pricing question and I'll pass the channel inventory question over to Pat. I think where we are is we're seeing a lot of different things occurring around deflation in the freight space. So I think, when we look at freight, we've all seen freight costs have gone down dramatically. We're experiencing that. We're seeing that benefit in our P&amp;L, and we'll continue to try to leverage that opportunity as much as possible. On the metals side and commodity space, we're seeing a little bit of indication that things are starting to pull back, as far as commodity prices. And so we're chasing that opportunity, but overall the commodity basket for us is not moving down dramatically at this stage. Now we are pursuing these opportunities to ensure that we actually get the benefit when they do emerge later this year or into next year, depending on how that plays out. But also we have to recognize that we probably won't see much of that benefit here in 2023 just given the level of inventory we have on our books. And that will get hung up in the inventory and we'll read through eventually in 2024. So the question then becomes what does that mean to pricing. And so what adjustments do we need to make? What's happening in the market? And at this point, we feel like our pricing is where it needs to be versus market conditions and the competitors. We tend to want to be, especially with brands like DEWALT, at a premium versus many of our competitors. And we feel like right now the pricing position is in a healthy place, and so we don't see any need for any adjustments associated with that. If deflation becomes a bigger number as we go into 2024, we will continue to look at that and evaluate that. However, we do have to remember that as we went through this historical inflationary cycle, we did not get 100% price recovery on that. It took many quarters for the pricing actions to get into our customers, and so we experienced a lot of margin pain in that transition period. And so there has to be a tail at the back end associated with this deflationary cycle, whatever it is. And we're going to work with our customers in a balanced way to do the right thing for ourselves, our company and for them. And we'll continue to take that approach as we've done in the past, and we think it's the right approach for this particular cycle. Pat, do you want to talk about where we are with channel inventory and where we're going?Patrick D. HallinanYes. Nicole, channel inventories, we look at our current level of channel inventories relative to history. We're very much at or right around normal levels of channel inventory. And so I think, if there wasn't macro uncertainty or if short-term rates weren't as high as they are, we would be biased to stay where we are or to the upside. But I think, because of the rate picture in particular, with our channel partners paying much more in short-term rates to support their inventory and the fact there is macro uncertainty, their bias is to keep things low and if not, to try to find new lows. We don't think there's big moves out there ahead of us. It's something very modest. And I would say our back half guidance anticipates somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $100 million of inventory reduction in our guidance as we've talked here today. And we think that's a pretty good number for the back half of the year. I mean obviously it could range outside of that if the macro environment changes, but that's what we've considered for the back half of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Adam Baumgarten with Zelman &amp; Associates.Adam Michael BaumgartenCan you just talk about how demand trended throughout the quarter into July? It seems like it built throughout the quarter. And the July commentary is pretty encouraging. Just maybe some additional color there would be helpful.Donald AllanWell, I think the markets are -- do have some volatility to them. However, when you step back and look at the trends that have been emerging in the first 6 months of 2023, we all know it was a very challenging outdoor season. And everyone in the industry experienced it. We experienced it, too. And the higher-priced ticket items, as I mentioned in my presentation, continue to be a pressure point. There's no doubt that the outdoor business went through a bubble during the pandemic. And there was a lot of purchasing activity because people were at home. And we're starting to see the back-end effect of that here in -- we experienced some of it last year and we're experiencing more here again in '23, and then we'll see what '24 brings in the future. The trends in POS continue to be positive, and I said that in my comments. July has been a good start to the quarter. At this point, it's not something that is an indication that we already feel like we're going to outperform expectations. As Pat said, it's a potential upside for us to evaluate and monitor as we go throughout the summer, and we'll see where things are trending. But the consumer continues to shift a lot of money away from home improvement and we just have to make sure that we continue to monitor that and see what happens. So I look at it as an opportunity and a positive that, hopefully, evolves as the back half plays out, but I don't want to get too excited about 3 or 4 weeks of activity at this stage.OperatorThank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Dennis Lange for closing remarks.Dennis M. LangeShannon, thanks. We'd like to thank everyone again for their time and participation on the call.

This comparison sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the company's value.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK): An Appealing Value or a Potential Trap?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line, as displayed on our summary page, represents the ideal fair trading value of a stock.

The current stock price of $102.85 per share suggests that investors should think twice before investing.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK): An Appealing Value or a Potential Trap?Link: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Assessing Stanley Black &amp; Decker's Financial StrengthCompanies with poor financial strength pose a high risk of permanent capital loss to investors. To avoid this, it's crucial to review a company's financial strength before purchasing shares. Key indicators like the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage offer insights into its financial health. Stanley Black &amp; Decker's cash-to-debt ratio stands at 0.05, ranking it lower than 95.81% of companies in the Industrial Products industry. Overall, Stanley Black &amp; Decker's financial strength is rated 4 out of 10, indicating poor financial health.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK): An Appealing Value or a Potential Trap?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, particularly those demonstrating consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is generally a safer investment than one with low profit margins. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been profitable for 10 out of the past 10 years. In the past twelve months, the company generated a revenue of $16.4 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.46. Its operating margin is 1.84%, ranking it lower than 74.11% of companies in the Industrial Products industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Stanley Black &amp; Decker's  profitability  at 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.One of the most crucial factors in a company's valuation is its  growth . Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. Stanley Black &amp; Decker's average annual revenue growth is 9.4%, ranking it better than 60.08% of companies in the Industrial Products industry. However, its 3-year average EBITDA growth is -21.2%, which ranks worse than 89.47% of companies in the Industrial Products industry.Another method to evaluate a company's profitability is comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC). ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Stanley Black &amp; Decker's ROIC was 0.77, while its WACC came in at 8.78.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK): An Appealing Value or a Potential Trap?Why Stanley Black &amp; Decker Might Be a Value TrapStanley Black &amp; Decker's potential value trap status is primarily due to its Piotroski F-score of only 3 out of a possible 9. This low score may indicate a downward trend in crucial aspects such as profitability, funding, and efficiency. Investors should therefore look beyond the attractive low valuation and ensure there are no hidden long-term risks.

DVA is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 46.3%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and lagged once, delivering an earnings surprise of 17.3%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, DaVita’s management confirmed that it witnessed an uptick in treatments per day in the quarter, driven by net census gains due to both higher admissions and lower mortality. However, management also anticipates a reduction in overall treatment volume on a year-over-year basis due to the annualization of access mortality from 2022. Management also continues to assume excess mortality in the remainder of 2023. These are likely to have weighed on DaVita’s second-quarter performance.On the same call, management confirmed that recent data continued to show an encouraging differentiation in hospitalization rates from patients in DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care (IKC) program versus its overall patient population. This trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter, thus leading to wider enrolment in the IKC program.Management also stated that as DaVita continues to scale its IKC business, it will continue to focus on driving its net saving rate while pursuing a cost-efficient model of care. This raises optimism about the stock.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-eps-surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteDaVita’s continued pharmaceutical cost-saving initiatives from its anemia management transition to MIRCERA, reductions in contract labor spend and positive variability in health benefits and insurance costs also look promising for its second-quarter performance.In the first quarter, DaVita witnessed sequential improvement in U.S. dialysis treatments per day despite missed treatment rates remaining high compared to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate the improvement in U.S. dialysis treatments per day to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thereby boosting DaVita’s revenues.Story continuesOn Apr 1, 2023, DaVita and Medtronic announced the launch of Mozarc Medical, a new independent device company focused exclusively on innovative kidney health technologies. Mozarc's current products and its research and development pipeline, from kidney access technologies to advanced home dialysis and acute therapies, are intended to improve the overall patient experience and increase access to home-based care. This raises our optimism about DaVita.The Estimate PictureFor second-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.94 billion for total revenues calls for an uptick of 0.6% from the prior-year reported figure.The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $1.66, indicating a decline of 27.8% from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates.

However, the sector is facing inflationary headwinds, supply-chain challenges and labor shortages that are weighing on margins.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 17.2% of the companies in the Medical sector, comprising 35.2% of the sector’s market capitalization, reported earnings till Jul 26. Majority (90%) of these companies beat on earnings as well as revenue estimates. While revenues witnessed a significant 12.8% increase, earnings growth was subdued at 3.1%. This scorecard highlights the aforementioned sector’s continued resilience amid an uncertain macroeconomic environment. The companies witnessed a surge in demand for surgery-related procedures in the first half. However, they also faced persistent higher costs globally. Rising costs of raw materials, labor shortages, increased interest payments and supply-chain disruptions adversely impacted the production and distribution process. However, these macro headwinds are likely to have lost their vigor from the first quarter. Meanwhile, an increase in the prices of products and services might have aided the Medical sector.Overall, second-quarter earnings are expected to decline 31.2%, while sales are anticipated to increase 3.3%. This compares with the first-quarter reported earnings decline of 17.9% and revenue growth of 4%.Medical Device Quarterly SynopsysThe reopening of economies continues to boost the demand for medical devices such as diagnostic equipment and procedures, leading to robust revenue growth. Companies have also been engaging in mergers and acquisitions to broaden their portfolios and capabilities. Technology breakthroughs such as artificial intelligence and robotics are spurring more innovation and growth in the sector. Companies that can effectively adapt to these changes and keep innovating are expected to maintain their market success.Story continuesYet, Medical Device companies continue to be burdened by the global shortage of semiconductor chips that produce life-saving medical equipment like pacemakers, blood-pressure monitors, insulin pumps and defibrillators. Although this ongoing challenge is expected to have hampered second-quarter performance across several businesses in the Medical Device industry, the impact is likely to have lessened. Moreover, rising cost of capital following multiple hikes in interest rates might have had an adverse impact on the companies’ bottom line.Overall, the rebound in the base business in the past several months is expected to have been impressive. Medical Device companies like McKesson MCK, Fresenius Medical Care FMS and Glaukos GKOSare likely to have experienced an improvement in revenues, while margins might have been subdued.Let’s take a look at the Medical Device players scheduled to announce results on Aug 2.McKesson: The company’s fiscal first-quarter 2024 results are likely to have been boosted by continued demand for its products across all segments. The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment is expected to have been benefited from market growth and higher volumes from retail national account customers. This is likely to have been partially offset by lower COVID-19 vaccine related sales. Growth in the technology services revenues and an increase in prescriptions from third-party logistics might have driven Prescription Technology Solutions’ performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for McKesson’s earnings is pegged at $5.85 per share. The consensus estimate for revenues is pinned at $69.91 billion.Per our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating on estimates.MCK is likely to post an earnings beat in the upcoming release as it has an Earnings ESP of +1.93% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

Overall price improvements also supported growth for the Care Enablement segment in the first quarter. This trend is likely to have been continued in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The company’s recently implemented new operating model might have continued to offer operational improvements during the second quarter. However, the bottom line is expected to have been hurt by inflationary cost increases in energy, material and personnel.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 24 cents per share.

Moreover, launch of new products like iPrime, iAccess and iStent during the past few quarters is expected to have been the key driver for the company’s revenue growth. Glaukos has successfully submitted a new drug application seeking approval for its advanced pipeline candidate, iDose TR, based on data from a phase III study. A potential approval is expected by the end of 2023. Glaukos is likely to discuss commercial plan for the iDose TR on its second-quarter earnings call. Meanwhile, ongoing clinical studies and launch of new products might have driven operating expenses higher during the soon-to-be-reported quarter.The bottom-line estimate for the second quarter is pegged at a loss of 57 cents per share.

Analysts on average had expected $1.59, according to Refinitiv data.AIG's life and retirement unit saw a 42% jump in premiums and deposits, partly helped by record sales in fixed index annuities.Total consolidated net investment income rose 37% to $3.6 billion, helped by higher income from fixed maturity securities and loan portfolios due to the higher reinvestment rates.The New York-based company's general insurance underwriting income fell 26%, hurt by $250 million in total catastrophe-related charges mainly related to U.S. storms and Typhoon Mawar, which hit the Western Pacific Island of Guam in May.Reinsurance broker Gallagher Re preliminarily pegged global insured losses from natural hazards in the first six months of 2023 at $52 billion, while weather and climate events alone were expected to have driven an insurance bill of $46 billion.Last month, peer insurer Travelers Companies reported a 98% slump in quarterly profit, as severe storms in parts of the United States caused the insurer's catastrophe losses net of reinsurance to jump to $1.48 billion.AIG's general insurance accident year combined ratio was 88%, compared with 88.5%, a year earlier. The metric excludes catastrophe losses and a ratio below 100 signifies that the insurer earns more from premiums than it pays out in claims.AIG also said it increased its share repurchase authorization to $7.5 billion.

(AP) — Diversity, equity and inclusion programs were abolished Tuesday from Walt Disney World's governing district, now controlled by appointees of Gov. Ron DeSantis, in an echo of the Florida governor's agenda which has championed curtailing such programs in higher education and elsewhere.The Central Florida Tourism Oversight District said in a statement that its diversity, equity and inclusion committee would be eliminated, as would any job duties connected to it. Also axed were initiatives left over from when the district was controlled by Disney supporters, which awarded contracts based on goals of achieving racial or gender parity.Glenton Gilzean, the district's new administrator who is African American and a former head of the Central Florida Urban League, called such initiatives “illegal and simply un-American."" Gilzean has been a fellow or member at two conservative institutions, the James Madison Institute and the American Enterprise Institute Leadership Network, as well as a DeSantis appointee to the Florida Commission on Ethics.“Our district will no longer participate in any attempt to divide us by race or advance the notion that we are not created equal,"" Gilzean said in a statement. ""As the former head of the Central Florida Urban League, a civil rights organization, I can say definitively that our community thrives only when we work together despite our differences.”An email was sent seeking comment from Disney World.Last spring, DeSantis, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, signed into law a measure that blocks public colleges from using federal or state funding on diversity programs.DeSantis also has championed Florida's so-called “Stop WOKE” law, which bars businesses, colleges and K-12 schools from giving training on certain racial concepts, such as the theory that people of a particular race are inherently racist, privileged or oppressed. A federal judge last November blocked the law’s enforcement in colleges, universities and businesses, calling it ""positively dystopian.”Story continuesThe creation of the district, then known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District, was instrumental in Disney’s decision to build a theme park resort near Orlando in the 1960s. Having a separate government allowed the company to provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its sprawling property. The district was controlled by Disney supporters for more than five decades.Richard Foglesong, a Rollins College professor emeritus, said he was surprised that the matter was decided internally, rather than by a public vote of the five members appointed by DeSantis to the district’s board who have promised repeatedly to be more transparent than their predecessors.“This is an issue of public importance,” said Foglesong, who wrote a definitive account of Disney World’s governance in his book, “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.”The DeSantis appointees took control of the renamed district earlier this year following a yearlong feud between the company and DeSantis. The fight began last year after Disney, beset by significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by Republican lawmakers and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. Disney sued DeSantis and his five board appointees in federal court, claiming the Florida governor violated the company’s free speech rights by taking the retaliatory action.Before the new board came in, Disney made agreements with previous oversight board members who were Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and development. The DeSantis-appointed members of the governing district have sued Disney in state court in a second lawsuit stemming from the district’s takeover, seeking to invalidate those agreements.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Ron DeSantis's war against The Walt Disney Co. has impacted the state's biggest tourism attraction and is leading to a broader backlash that could seriously hurt the state's economy.DeSantis, a right-wing candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, singled out Disney because of its LGBTQ+ values and inclusivity, which he disagrees with.

As part of his ""war on woke"" campaign, DeSantis took control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the special taxing district for the Disney resort's land, resulting in legal battles and strained relations with the entertainment giant.In May, Disney made headlines when it canceled a $1 billion project to construct an office campus and transfer 2,000 employees to Orlando. The company also pulled the plug on a promising Star Wars hotel that had only been operational at Disney World for a short time.These actions were followed by pointed remarks from Disney CEO Bob Iger, who criticized DeSantis, branding him as ""anti-business"" and ""anti-Florida.""Disney has turned its focus to a new endeavor known as Disneyland Forward. The program is aimed at rejuvenating its two theme parks in Anaheim, California. The company envisions Disneyland Forward as a catalyst for significant growth, projecting an annual revenue of $253 million and the creation of more than 2,200 new jobs.Story continuesTo stay updated with top startup news &amp; investments, sign up for Benzinga's Startup Investing &amp; Equity Crowdfunding NewsletterThe consequences of DeSantis's actions are not limited to the Disney dispute. Florida's political climate, characterized by controversial policies concerning LGBTQ rights and race, has led to a growing number of conventions and conferences avoiding the state altogether. At least five groups have canceled or moved their events out of Orange County and Fort Lauderdale over concerns about the state's policies.Florida's tourism industry is displaying broader signs of decline, particularly in the Orlando area. The Orange County comptroller's office reported a 6.7% decrease in tourist development tax collections for May compared to the previous year, marking the second consecutive decrease since February 2021.Hotel occupancy in the Orlando area during May was down by 2.5% year over year. Analysts also point out that crowds in Walt Disney World over the July 4 holiday were the lowest they've been in nearly a decade, a trend also affecting rival theme park Universal Orlando Resort. Factors contributing to the decline include families transitioning away from theme parks as the pent-up demand following the COVID-19 pandemic subsided and visitors are displeased about widespread price increases at Disney's theme parks.The combination of political controversies and other factors is creating a challenging environment for local businesses and officials who rely on the thriving tourism sector. The implications extend beyond the Disney-DeSantis feud and raise questions about the long-term sustainability of Florida's tourism-driven economy.See more on startup investing from Benzinga:Airbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO.

Before Iger selected Bob Chapek to replace him as CEO, both Mayer and Staggs were widely seen as candidates for the job.Iger has been tasked, once again, with finding someone to replace him before his contract expires in 2026.

Another cohort of major utility stocks, including Atmos Energy ATO, Exelon EXC, NiSource NI and Entergy Corp. ETR, is set to announce earnings on Aug 2.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities against the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are projected to contribute to this sector’s second-quarter results.Utilities have been aggressively adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios.  Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades. We expect the second-quarter results from utility companies to reflect such clean energy developments.Utilities have also been focused on improving productivity and cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. They continue to invest smart capital that helps reduce operating and maintenance expenses and fuel costs. This, in turn, helps customers save money on utility bills. This is likely to get reflected in the customer growth rate for these utility providers in their second-quarter results.However, the fact that utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, has made their operations difficult in the current interest rate scenario. Thus, the capital-intensive utilities are likely to have experienced higher borrowing costs, thanks to the rise in interest rates from near-zero levels, which in turn might have hurt their bottom-line performance. Also, fluctuating weather conditions across major parts of the United States are likely to have unfavorably impacted the utilities’ performance in the April-June quarter.Story continuesQ2 ExpectationsTotal second-quarter earnings and revenues of Utility stocks are expected to decline 5.7% and 0.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at the following utility companies that are scheduled to post their quarterly report on Aug 2 and find out how things might have shaped up prior to the announcements.Atmos Energy delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.92%.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced the availability of API Security, a product that stops application programming interface (API) attacks and detects business logic abuse inside APIs. In addition, Akamai's API Security discovers, audits and monitors API activity using behavioral analytics to rapidly respond to threats and abuse.Akamai Technologies, Inc. logo (PRNewsfoto/Akamai Technologies, Inc.)API security has become a critical concern for organizations as API attacks continue to grow. A recent State of the Internet report by Akamai noted that 2022 was a record year for application and API attacks. Once an API has been authorized by a web application and API protection (WAAP) product, security teams have no visibility into its use within the organization. Malicious actors are aware of this blind spot and have shifted to abusing the vast API attack surface.Akamai's stand-alone API Security solution is a result of Akamai's acquisition of Neosec, announced in April of this year. It works with any API gateway, WAAP or cloud implementation. Akamai customers can also take advantage of edge connector, an integration that saves the time, energy, and cost of product integration with the click of a button.The API Security product provides complete visibility into API activity, uses behavioral analytics to detect complex threats and improves detections by analyzing historical data uniquely stored in a data lake. The offering delivers API discovery, visibility and risk auditing combined with detection and response capabilities that enable full investigation and threat hunting. With API Security's differentiating Shadow Hunt threat hunting managed service, machine learning signals are delivered to human analysts for investigation. Users can see their APIs, which means they can ensure protection by recording API activity, detecting any possible breaches and keeping customer data safe.Story continues""Akamai's API Security helps us with discovering and monitoring our critical APIs for all applications,"" said Stan Lee, CISO of Earnin, a financial technology company. ""It helps us to improve compliance and risk management while enabling business process agility and outcomes.""""Recent breaches have painfully revealed the necessity of API security solutions. Preventing API-based attacks by guarding endpoints and checking credentials is no longer sufficient,"" said Rupesh Chokshi, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Application Security at Akamai. ""Akamai's API Security gives organizations the ability to monitor API behavior in any platform or gateway to ensure that business processes are running smoothly and securely.""Forrester Research recently noted the importance of API security in light of recent attacks. ""API security is the hot app-sec tool of 2023. APIs made front-page news in 2022 when 9.8 million Optus customers had personal information stolen and ransomed due to a publicly exposed API that did not require authentication. Optus wasn't the only one: Twitter, T-Mobile, and a law enforcement app all had API vulnerabilities that exposed data. The good news is that global security decision-makers reported that API security adoption rose from 2020 to 2022 and shows no signs of slowing. Use your increased security budget to inventory and secure your APIs."" (The State of Application Security, 2023, Forrester Research, Inc., June 7, 2023)API Security complements Akamai's existing App &amp; API Protector (AAP) solution. Together, they deliver the most comprehensive global protection, combining enterprise-wide visibility, behavioral analysis of API activity and prevention of attacks and abuse. This joint strategy enables:Broader discovery to see APIs on and off the Akamai content delivery networkLayered detections that are both signature-based and behavioral.Customized responses to block threats in-line or remediate issues.All of these protections benefit from easy deployment in one control center.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive What Is Colgate-Palmolive's Debt?As you can see below, at the end of June 2023, Colgate-Palmolive had US$8.99b of debt, up from US$7.99b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it does have US$1.09b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$7.90b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Colgate-Palmolive's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Colgate-Palmolive had liabilities of US$4.63b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$11.3b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.09b and US$1.66b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$13.2b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.Story continuesWhile this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Colgate-Palmolive has a huge market capitalization of US$63.4b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Colgate-Palmolive's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.0 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 16.5 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. Sadly, Colgate-Palmolive's EBIT actually dropped 6.4% in the last year. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Colgate-Palmolive can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Colgate-Palmolive recorded free cash flow worth 68% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewHappily, Colgate-Palmolive's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But truth be told we feel its EBIT growth rate does undermine this impression a bit. All these things considered, it appears that Colgate-Palmolive can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Colgate-Palmolive is showing  3 warning signs in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

The petroleum industry group reported a crude draw of 1.319M barrels in the prior week to July 21.The API numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, or EIA, on Wednesday.Over three previous weeks, both the API and EIA had been reporting lackluster draws on the U.S. petroleum complex despite Saudi Arabia claiming to have taken an additional million barrels per day off its daily production.If the inventory drop in the API report is reflected as well by the EIA, it would underscore efforts by the Saudis to squeeze supply on the global market, especially in the face of less purchases by China amid economic troubles faced by the largest oil importer.Along with the broader crude draw it reported for last week, the API cited a slide of 1.76M barrels last week at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub that takes delivery of U.S. crude. In the prior week, the API reported a Cushing deficit of 2.34M barrels.On the fuels side, API reported a gasoline inventory drop of 1.68M barrels and a distillate stock build/slide of 0.512M barrels. In the previous week, it noted a 1.043M barrel draw for gasoline and 1.614M build for distillates.With the API report out, anticipation builds on what the EIA will cite for last week’s oil supply-demand in the United States, and how that will impact crude prices that have been rallying the past five weeks.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 0.071M barrels, versus the 0.6M barrel reduction reported during the week to July 21.Story continuesOn the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 0.049M barrels over the 0.786M-barrel decline in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a drop of 0.216M barrels versus the prior week’s deficit of 0.245M.

Ahead of the U.S. government report, industry group American Petroleum Institute, API, will release after Tuesday’s market close its own supply-demand numbers for last week.Saudi Arabia had committed to cut an additional million barrels per day from its supply through July, on top of reductions by the 13-member OPEC, or the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which it heads. Russia, which leads 10 independent oil producers, has also volunteered cuts. The two groups together form the OPEC+ alliance.Their pledges on lower production have not matched up with July oil supply-demand data released thus far by the EIA.“As I’ve said, no one is looking for a barrel-for-barrel correlation between the promised cuts and the weekly U.S. petroleum inventories,” said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital. “But the talk of market tightness which dominates every conversation on oil has to show up in the EIA data. Otherwise this rally is at the risk of reversal.”With a half-hour to Tuesday’s settlement, U.S. West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude was down 6 cents, or 0.07%, to $81.74 per barrel. The U.S. crude benchmark gained more than $11, or nearly 16%, for July.London-based Brent crude was down 16 cents, or 0.2%, to $85.27. The global oil benchmark rose for last month.Story continuesIn data due at approximately 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT), API will give a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended July 28. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the EIA a day later.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 0.071M barrels, versus the 0.6M barrel reduction reported during the week to July 21.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 0.049M barrels over the 0.786M-barrel decline in the previous week.

The same for earnings is pinned at 43 cents per share.Factors to NoteDENTSPLY SIRONA’s Technologies &amp; Equipment segment is likely to have witnessed organic growth in the quarter under review. Higher demand for clear aligners is expected to have driven the segment’s sales growth, partially offset by weakness in CAD/CAM. Implant sales in China are likely to have reflected the adverse impact of volume-based procurement (VBP) policy in the country that resulted in lower price per product, especially high-value products.Strong retail demand for consumable products might have benefited the Consumable segment’s sales during the to-be-reported quarter.Foreign currency movement had a negative impact on total revenues during the first quarter. The trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter as well.On its first-quarter earnings call, XRAY’s management stated that the international glaucoma and corneal health franchises showed continued strength. The trend is likely to have continued in the quarter to be reported.However, volatile macroeconomic environment raises uncertainty. Inflationary pressure, coupled with commercial investments and restructuring and remediation costs, is likely to have fueled operating expenses during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, hurting margins.

Presently, 73% (or nearly three in four marketers) are using addressable TV, compared to 63% (or nearly two in three marketers) when the study was fielded this same time last year. This is a 16% increase.""The big story behind these findings is growth,"" said Dan Rosenfeld, SVP, Data Analytics &amp; Insights, DIRECTV Advertising. ""Two years into Go Addressable’s launch, we are excited to see that the needle behind adoption, usage and awareness of this medium has continued to move consistently. We take these findings to heart and remain committed to finding ways to further enhance, innovate and pioneer addressable advertising’s future.""The study revealed positive momentum in other key areas:Among those polled, nearly half (49%) had a combined linear and digital team planning addressable TV strategies for marketers.The percentage of respondents citing ""better measurement/proof of ROI"" as a factor to consider when increasing or initiating addressable TV investments dropped from 50% to 43% in this latest study, suggesting that there has been more industry-wide education and awareness of how the medium works and its benefits over the past year.The findings also yielded important insights when it comes to areas that need more improvement or focus. One example is the industry’s perception versus what is currently being done around attribution. Respondents, in particular, noted that they felt there is currently ""inadequate attribution to prove the ROI of addressable TV advertising."" (Contrast that with the fact that Go Addressable currently works with the top 20 attribution vendors in market.)Story continues""Addressable advertising has evolved tremendously in recent years, and clients find that using this method adds immediate value to their media plans,"" said Jen Soch, Executive Director, Channel Solutions, GroupM.

347,1b3a0633-1823-3025-aed6-0a1714cf9f51,CMCSA,2023-08-02,Serving Those Who Served: Comcast NBCUniversal Recognizes National Hire a Veteran Day,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/serving-those-served-comcast-nbcuniversal-141500873.html,1690899300,STORY,['CMCSA'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 1, 2023 / Comcast Corporation  Our nation's heroes and their families should not have to battle for a place in the civilian workforce. Although there's been progress recently in how employers recruit and hire military-connected talent, we can't take our eye off the ball.As we recognize National Hire a Veteran Day, it's necessary to confront the barriers veterans and military spouses encounter in their civilian careers. It's not enough to thank them for their service and sacrifices. Instead, we must transform our gratitude into action and continue to work together to bridge the military-civilian divide.Approximately 200,000 service members transition from military to civilian life each year, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. These veterans bring a unique combination of technical skills and applicable experience to the civilian workforce. They're exceptional leaders, strategic thinkers, and problem solvers. They're also team-oriented, dedicated, and disciplined. Yet, too many struggle to find meaningful employment after they hang up their uniforms.The employment landscape is even more challenging for military spouses, a group often overshadowed in this discourse. For more than a decade, they have faced an unemployment rate at or above 20%, a figure largely attributed to frequent relocations. Moreover, the Blue Star Families' annual Military Family Lifestyle Survey found that financial pressures and spousal unemployment or underemployment were the biggest issues affecting military families in 2022.A common misconception among employers is that military service doesn't translate to the civilian workplace. However, only a small fraction of veterans-roughly 20%-served in combat-related roles. The others worked in career fields that also exist in the civilian sector, such as logistics, engineering, cybersecurity, communications, and more.Here at Comcast NBCUniversal, we deeply value the diverse backgrounds and skillsets of our military-connected colleagues. They serve in a variety of roles across the enterprise, from project management to marketing, and their work ethic and adaptability are invaluable attributes in our fast-paced, dynamic industry.That's why we've implemented military culture training programs for our recruiters and hiring managers, including the SHRM Foundation's Veterans at Work Certificate Program and PsychArmor's School for Employers. Through these programs, we deepen our team's understanding of military service and ability to identify transferable skills. We also offer fellowships for transitioning service members and paid internships for student veterans and military spouses who are searching for their next career.Since 2015, we've welcomed more than 20,000 veterans and military spouses into our Comcast NBCUniversal family. For us, though, it's about more than just hiring numbers. It's about cultivating an inclusive and empowering environment where military-connected employees can grow and thrive.20K+ Veterans and military spouses welcomed into the Comcast NBCUniversal familyNo matter where our teammates are in their military journey, we're here to support them and their families at every turn and through every transition. We're aware of the challenges many face because of military service, and we're proud to offer a comprehensive list of employee benefits and programs to meet their unique needs. This includes our Military Concierge, Guard and Reserve Leave, Differential Pay, and Military Spouse Transfer Assistance.Our Veterans Network (VetNet) Employee Resource Group is another great example of how our connection to the military company has influenced our company culture and focus. With over 8,500 members, this group serves as a vital support system for our military-connected teammates, providing opportunities for mentorship, networking, and professional development. VetNet members also participate in several veteran-related service projects each year, including Wreaths Across America, Boxes to Boots, and our Flag Replacement Program.8.5K+ Veterans Network (VetNet) Employee Resource Group membersComcast has a longstanding tradition of serving those who have served. Our founder, Ralph Roberts, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and we continue to honor his legacy by donating to military community-serving organizations, creating special experiences for our military customers, and supporting veteran-owned small businesses and entrepreneurs through Comcast RISE.More than ever, we're focused on helping veterans and their families navigate our increasingly digital world. We recently announced plans to expand our installation of Lift Zones in community centers nationwide through Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to advancing digital equity. These Lift Zones provide military families with free, high-capacity WiFi, along with access to digital literacy programs and workforce development resources. In addition, we're partnering with NPower and other nonprofit organizations to provide tech training and job placement.Ultimately, we view our enduring commitment to hiring and empowering veterans and their families as an investment-one that not only enhances our workforce, but also contributes to the health of our nation's military. All branches of the military are struggling to meet their recruitment goals, and we support those who serve by addressing the most pressing needs of military families, creating pathways to meaningful employment for veterans and military spouses, and helping members of the Guard and Reserve find balance between their military and civilian careers.As a military spouse and the mother of a service member, I'm proud to lead the Military Engagement effort at Comcast NBCUniversal, and I extend my sincere gratitude to all companies and organizations that share our passion for supporting veterans and their families. I also encourage more businesses to strengthen and diversify their workforces with military talent.It's time to recognize the potential of our veterans and military spouses and bring them into the fold. So, this National Hire a Veteran Day, let's all make a commitment to value their service in our businesses as much as we value their service to our nation.To learn more about Comcast NBCUniversal's Military Engagement initiative, click here.

In the last reported quarter, the electric vehicle (EV) giant witnessed record production, deliveries and revenues. We expect deliveries to see an annualized growth of around 36% in 2023.Production ramp-up at gigafactory 4 (in Berlin) and 5 (in Austin) and introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term deliveries growth. The Zacks analyst anticipates automotive revenues to rise more than 18% this year. Additionally, Tesla's energy generation and storage revenues outlook is promising.Falling debt levels and solid potential of its charging business are other positives. While shrinking margins remain a near-term concern, we expect Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and introduction of new models.(You can read the full research report on Tesla here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Comcast have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year (+24.9% vs. +4.5%). The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. Comcast's plan to transition to DOCSIS 4.0 is noteworthy. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting.

(NYSE: PRU) today reported second quarter results. Net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. was $511 million ($1.38 per Common share) for the second quarter of 2023, compared to a net loss of $1.010 billion ($2.71 per Common share) for the second quarter of 2022. After-tax adjusted operating income was $1.087 billion ($2.94 per Common share) for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $895 million ($2.34 per Common share) for the second quarter of 2022.Consolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP measures. A discussion of these measures, including definitions thereof, how they are useful to investors, and certain limitations thereof, is included later in this press release under ""Non-GAAP Measures"" and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the tables that accompany this release.RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONSThe Company’s ongoing operations include PGIM, U.S. Businesses, International Businesses, and Corporate &amp; Other. In the following business-level discussion, adjusted operating income refers to pre-tax results.PGIMPGIM, the Company’s global investment management business, reported adjusted operating income of $179 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $206 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease primarily reflects lower asset management fees, driven by net outflows and rising rates, and higher expenses, partially offset by higher other related revenues, driven by higher seed and co-investment income.PGIM assets under management of $1.266 trillion were up 1% from the year-ago quarter, primarily resulting from equity market appreciation, partially offset by higher interest rates and net outflows. Third-party net outflows of $5.2 billion in the current quarter were driven primarily by redemptions from public equity strategies and reflect institutional outflows of $3.0 billion and retail outflows of $2.2 billion.U.S. BusinessesU.S. Businesses reported adjusted operating income of $956 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $573 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase includes a favorable comparative impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements of $1.606 billion, partially offset by the absence of a one-time gain on the sale of a block of legacy variable annuities of $1.448 billion. Excluding these items, current quarter results primarily reflect higher net investment spread results and more favorable underwriting results, partially offset by lower net fee income.Retirement Strategies, consisting of Institutional Retirement Strategies and Individual Retirement Strategies, reported adjusted operating income of $876 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $2.181 billion in the year-ago quarter.Institutional Retirement Strategies:Reported adjusted operating income of $428 million in the current quarter, compared to $432 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease includes a less favorable comparative impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements of $8 million. Excluding this item, current quarter results primarily reflect higher fee income from business growth. In addition, net investment spread results reflect business growth, offset by lower variable investment income.Account values of $259 billion, a record high, increased 10% from the year-ago quarter and reflect business growth driven by significant pension risk transfer transactions. Sales in the current quarter of $5.7 billion included $3.6 billion of international reinsurance transactions.Individual Retirement Strategies:Reported adjusted operating income of $448 million in the current quarter, compared to $1.749 billion in the year-ago quarter. This decrease includes a less favorable comparative impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements of $7 million and the absence of a one-time gain on the sale of a block of legacy variable annuities of $1.448 billion. Excluding these items, current quarter results primarily reflect higher net investment spread results, partially offset by lower fee income, net of distribution expenses and other associated costs.Account values of $115 billion were down 6% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting the reinsurance of a block of legacy variable annuities and net outflows, partially offset by market appreciation. Sales of $1.9 billion in the current quarter increased 19% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued momentum from our FlexGuard products and increased sales of fixed annuity products.Group Insurance:Reported adjusted operating income of $139 million in the current quarter, a record high, compared to $54 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase includes a favorable comparative impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements of $39 million. Excluding this item, current quarter results primarily reflect more favorable underwriting results in both group life and disability, partially offset by higher expenses driven by business growth.Reported earned premiums, policy charges, and fees of $1.4 billion increased 7% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth in disability.Individual Life:Reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $59 million in the current quarter, compared to a loss of $1.662 billion in the year-ago quarter. This lower loss includes a favorable comparative impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements of $1.582 billion. Excluding this item, current quarter results primarily reflect higher net investment spread results.Sales of $197 million in the current quarter increased 27% from the year-ago quarter, driven by Variable Life, reflecting our pivot to less market sensitive products.International BusinessesInternational Businesses, consisting of Life Planner and Gibraltar Life &amp; Other, reported adjusted operating income of $784 million for the second quarter of 2023, compared to $692 million in the year-ago quarter.

This increase reflects higher net investment spread results and business growth.Constant dollar basis sales(4) of $250 million in the current quarter increased 12% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by record high sales in Brazil, as well as higher sales in Japan.Gibraltar Life &amp; Other:Reported adjusted operating income of $297 million in the current quarter, compared to $249 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase includes a favorable comparative impact from our annual assumption update and other refinements of $32 million.

This higher loss primarily reflects higher expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts, lower net investment income, and lower income from pension and other employee benefit plans.NET INCOMENet Income in the current quarter included $765 million of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments, including $51 million of pre-tax net impairment and credit-related losses, $3 million of pre-tax losses related to market experience updates, $16 million of pre-tax earnings from divested and run-off businesses, and $16 million of pre-tax gains related to net change in value of market risk benefits.Net loss for the year-ago quarter included $2.438 billion of pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments, largely reflecting the impacts of rising interest rates, and also $104 million of pre-tax net impairment and credit-related losses, $710 million of pre-tax losses related to net change in value of market risk benefits, $515 million of pre-tax earnings from divested and run-off businesses, and $371 million of pre-tax gains related to market experience updates.EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALLMembers of Prudential’s senior management will host a conference call on Wednesday, August 2, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss with the investment community the Company’s second quarter results.

Forward-looking statements are made based on management’s current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects upon Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Prudential Financial, Inc.’s actual results may differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements. Certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or estimates reflected in such forward-looking statements can be found in the ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" sections included in Prudential Financial, Inc.’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements herein are subject to the risk, among others, that we will be unable to execute our strategy because of market or competitive conditions or other factors. Prudential Financial, Inc. does not undertake to update any particular forward-looking statement included in this document.NON-GAAP MEASURESConsolidated adjusted operating income and adjusted book value are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release.We believe that our use of these non-GAAP measures helps investors understand and evaluate the Company’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described below. Adjusted book value augments the understanding of our financial position by providing a measure of net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations separate from the portion that is affected by capital and currency market conditions, and by isolating the accounting impact associated with insurance liabilities that are generally not marked to market and the supporting investments that are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income under GAAP. However, these non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive these measures are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position. The schedules accompanying this release provide reconciliations of non-GAAP measures with the corresponding measures calculated using GAAP. Additional historic information relating to our financial performance is located on our website at investor.prudential.com.Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Adjusted operating income excludes ""Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments"". A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.Realized investment gains (losses) within certain businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income.Adjusted operating income excludes ""Change in value of market risk benefits, net of related hedging gains (losses)"", which reflects the impact from changes in current market conditions, and market experience updates, reflecting the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability, which we believe enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of Divested and Run-off Businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes other items, such as certain components of the consideration for acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods, and goodwill impairments. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP and excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.Adjusted operating income does not equate to ""Net income"" as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above.Adjusted book value is calculated as total equity (GAAP book value) excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the cumulative effect of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurements and currency translation adjustments corresponding to realized investment gains and losses. These items are excluded in order to highlight the book value attributable to our core business operations separate from the portion attributable to external and potentially volatile capital and currency market conditions.FOOTNOTES(1)On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update 2018-12 for Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which provided new authoritative guidance impacting the accounting and disclosure requirements for long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company.

It also expects to place 490 to 520 wells on production, below the 500 to 530 forecast in April.Devon, which operates in Permian's Delaware basin, forecast capital spending of about $900 million in the third quarter, less than in the second quarter, after one temporary fracking crew was dropped from the basin.Top oilfield service companies have flagged weakening North American oilfield activity in the second half of the year, though recent strength in oil prices have led some companies to forecast a recovery in drilling and fracking later this year.Devon maintained its full-year production forecast of 643,000 to 663,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while Pioneer raised its output estimate by 3% at its midpoint to a range of 697,000 to 717,000 boepd.Pioneer's second-quarter profit more than halved to $4.49 but beat analysts' consensus estimate of $4.18, sending its shares 1.2% higher to $227.90 in extended trading.Devon's adjusted income fell over 50% to $1.18, in line with analysts' estimates.

The 87.53-megawatt MW (DC) clean energy portfolio is one of the largest in the nation making affordable renewable energy accessible to low- and moderate-income (LMI) residents.The program will allow local community residents to subscribe to nearby solar installations located on Public Storage’s rooftops. Subscribers will receive discounted electricity, often with additional savings for LMI households. Community solar expands access to renewable energy for those who are unable to install solar panels for reasons such as high costs, lack of roof control, or insufficient sunlight. Public Storage’s rooftop projects will lower energy bills for subscribers, saving residents millions of dollars per year on electricity costs.The nation-leading community solar portfolio includes 21 projects spanning 13.2 MW that were announced on July 27 by the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) as part of its Community-Driven Community Solar tranche of the Illinois Shines program. The 21 projects will serve nearly 1,500 households.Public Storage’s 57 low-income focused community solar installations in Maryland will serve nearly 2,600 homes, many of them LMI families, making it the largest portfolio of projects from a single company in the Maryland Community Solar Pilot Program’s LMI subcategory. These projects will save Maryland residents nearly $1,000,000 per year on their energy bills.Story continuesPublic Storage plans to dedicate up to 44 of its properties in Illinois to community solar including the 21 approved by the IPA, and plans to dedicate another 32 properties in New Jersey. The company and Solar Landscape worked in close collaboration on site selection, solar system design, financing options, and state program applications to maximize the effectiveness of the company’s rooftops.

(Nasdaq: MU), and the Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science &amp; Technology (MOST) celebrated the ribbon-cutting of a new permanent exhibit last night with local educators, elected officials and community stakeholders. “DECONSTRUCTED: Semiconductors and Other Secrets Inside Everyday Technology” will offer Central New York’s K-8 students, along with their teachers and families, hands-on exposure to semiconductors through an interactive exhibit sponsored by Micron.In October 2022, Micron announced the Community Investment Framework, shortly after disclosing the selection of Clay, New York, as the site of the company’s planned investment of up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to construct a new megafab. This agreement, made between the company and New York State, details a suite of commitments to the community that will help Micron, together with state and local partners, equip Central New York’s workforce with the skills needed to sustain leading-edge domestic semiconductor manufacturing.As part of Micron’s long-standing commitment to investing in and enriching the communities where its team members live and work through philanthropy and volunteerism, the company announced a $500,000 sponsorship of the MOST under the Community Investment Framework. The sponsorship includes the funding of a STEM education series and design challenges to provide continuous learning opportunities; MOST science camps held during midwinter and spring breaks, made available to students at no cost; and “DECONSTRUCTED: Semiconductors and Other Secrets Inside Everyday Technology,” an exhibit using hands-on experiences to inspire students and their families to learn about semiconductors.The MOST and Micron took an intentional approach to ensure that the exhibit would serve as a relevant and accessible community resource. The MOST / Micron Exhibit Advisory Group —composed of representatives from the MOST, Micron, local school districts and leading community organizations — met for the first time in December 2022. The group met regularly over the following months to make sure the exhibit was designed inclusively and collaboratively to reflect and meet the needs of the Central New York community.Story continues“It's wonderful to see the innovations we develop at Micron on display at the MOST, where young learners and their families are demystifying advanced technology and getting interactive answers to questions about our industry, our company — and their futures,” said April Arnzen, senior vice president and chief people officer at Micron and president of the Micron Foundation. “As we continue our efforts to build the workforce of the future, it’s critical to remember that it’s never too early to start building a passion for STEM. I’m grateful to the diverse group of gifted educators, museum experts and community leaders who so generously shared their time and expertise on the Exhibit Advisory Group as we worked together to develop a community resource that reflects Central New York.”The 1,200-square-foot exhibit is made up of four sections, each designed with universal design principles for museums to ensure accessibility for visitors and promoting the hands-on STEM learning that powers the MOST.Museum visitors can learn about types of memory and components of storage in Inside a Chip, which features interactive games.DECONSTRUCTED explores the history, application and production of memory chips. Recognizable products and the chips that power them are displayed in this section.The Skill Bar features video interviews with Micron employees — from fab engineers to safety managers, equipment technicians and more — conducted by WCNY’s Reading Buddies. The locally beloved puppets help Micron employees tell museum visitors about the skills they use at work and introduce a range of possible careers in the semiconductor field.Finally, museum visitors can go to the Meet Micron section to check out a range of the most innovative products — from servers to SSDs — made by Micron and its consumer brand, Crucial. Highlighting the community effort that went into developing the exhibit, this section features a rotating showcase of projects developed by students in Micron’s flagship STEM education program, Chip Camp, and a chip-manufacturing model produced by students from the East Syracuse Minoa School District. Visitors can also explore the same 3D model of the planned megafab in Clay that President Joe Biden saw in Syracuse in October 2022.“It’s been a pleasure working with Micron to develop this exciting new exhibit,” said Lauren Kochian, president of the MOST. “We expect about 120,000 visitors to the MOST in 2023, and we’re thrilled that so many learners, educators and families will get hands-on experience with our new community partner, Micron. We’d love to see community members here later this week, experiencing the informal science learning experiences we’ve shared with the community for more than 30 years.”""DECONSTRUCTED: Semiconductors and Other Secrets Inside Everyday Technology” will open for member families and educators on Wednesday, Aug. 2. The exhibit’s grand opening follows on Thursday, Aug. 3, and Micron’s sponsorship will facilitate free entry for all that day.To learn more about the exhibit, visit https://www.most.org/micron/.

(NYSE:MTD) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 16% in the last quarter. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been very strong. In fact, the share price is 114% higher today. We think it's more important to dwell on the long term returns than the short term returns. Ultimately business performance will determine whether the stock price continues the positive long term trend.While this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment. See our latest analysis for Mettler-Toledo International While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Mettler-Toledo International managed to grow its earnings per share at 22% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 16% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Mettler-Toledo International's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveMettler-Toledo International shareholders are down 6.9% for the year, but the market itself is up 12%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Mettler-Toledo International better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Mettler-Toledo International  you should be aware of.Story continuesBut note: Mettler-Toledo International may not be the best stock to buy.

The Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.8 billion related to the Merchant Solutions reporting unit in the quarter.On an organic basis, consolidated revenue increased 2% as compared to the prior-year period primarily due to recurring revenue growth from processing volumes and professional services in Banking, increased Merchant volumes and continued strength in Capital Markets.

Adjusted EBITDA loss was $143 million, including $161 million of corporate expenses.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsAs of June 30, 2023, debt outstanding totaled $19.5 billion. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was $953 million. In the quarter, the Company returned $309 million of capital to shareholders through dividends paid. The Company remains committed to maintaining a targeted dividend payout ratio of 35% of adjusted net earnings.Update on Enterprise Transformation Program (Future Forward)As of June 30, 2023, the Company achieved annualized run-rate Future Forward cash savings of over $315 million exiting the quarter, including over $175 million of operational expense savings and over $140 million of capital expense savings. In light of the recently announced Worldpay separation, the Company is updating its target post-separation cash savings exiting 2024 from $1.25 billion to $1.0 billion, of which over two-thirds represents annualized run-rate savings. This $1.0 billion represents an expected retention of 80% of the original program's total commitment prior to the effects of the Worldpay separation.Update on Pending Separation of Worldpay Merchant Solutions BusinessOn July 6, 2023, the Company announced an acceleration of its previously announced separation plan to create two highly focused global companies with greater strategic flexibility. FIS signed a definitive agreement to sell a 55% stake in its Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to private equity funds managed by GTCR in a transaction valuing Worldpay at up to $18.5 billion, including $1.0 billion of consideration contingent on the returns realized by GTCR exceeding certain thresholds. Based on the valuation, including estimated selling price adjustments and fair value of contingent consideration, the Company incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $6.8 billion related to the Merchant Solutions reporting unit due to its estimated fair value being less than its carrying value.The Worldpay transaction is expected to close by Q1 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Following the closing of this transaction, FIS' ownership interest in Worldpay will be reported as income from minority interest.Third Quarter and Full-Year 2023 GuidanceThe Company plans to present the operating results and cash flows of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business as discontinued operations for all periods presented beginning Q3 2023. As a result, revenue for the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business will be incorporated into ""Discontinued operations, net of tax"" rather than included within ""Revenue"" on our Statement of Earnings (Loss). Excluding the impact of the planned discontinued operations presentation, the Company is updating its third quarter and full-year guidance on a pre-discontinued operations basis.($ millions)3Q 2023FY 2023Revenue$3,640 - $3,690$14,500 - $14,631WebcastFIS will sponsor a live webcast of its earnings conference call with the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. (EDT) on Wednesday, August 2, 2023.

Follow FIS on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter (@FISGlobal).FIS Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.These non-GAAP measures include constant currency revenue, organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’ operating performance. The constant currency and organic revenue growth measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue growth also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures and excludes revenue from Corporate and Other, giving investors further insight into our performance. Finally, free cash flow provides further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.Constant currency revenue represents reported operating segment revenue excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.Organic revenue growth is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period, which is adjusted to add pre-acquisition revenue of acquired businesses for a portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was owned, and subtract pre-divestiture revenue for divested businesses for the portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was not owned, for any acquisitions or divestitures by FIS. When referring to organic revenue growth, revenues from our Corporate and Other segment, which is comprised of revenue from non-strategic businesses, are excluded.Adjusted EBITDA reflects net earnings (loss) before interest, other income (expense), taxes, equity method investment earnings (loss), and depreciation and amortization, and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems non-operational in nature, or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue.Adjusted net earnings excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. These include, among others, the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization and equity method investment earnings (loss), both of which are recurring.Adjusted EPS reflects adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.Free cash flow reflects net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and excluding certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS website, www.fisglobal.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThis earnings release and today’s webcast contain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

This item also includes $17 million and $43 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, of incremental amortization expense associated with shortened estimated useful lives and accelerated amortization methods for certain acquired software driven by the Company's platform modernization. The Company has excluded the impact of purchase price amortization expense as such amounts can be significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Although the Company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP expenses, the Company believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of future assets.(2)This item represents costs comprised of the following:Three months endedSix months endedJune 30,June 30,2023202220232022Acquisition and integration$9$30$16$75Enterprise transformation, including Future Forward and platform modernization7880153160Severance and other termination expenses23365147Planned separation of the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business20—31—Incremental stock compensation directly attributable to specific programs641665Other, including divestiture-related expenses and enterprise cost control and other initiatives434863Subtotal140221265410Accelerated amortization (a)13423294Total$153$263$297$504Amounts in table may not sum due to rounding.(a)For purposes of calculating Adjusted net earnings, this item includes incremental amortization expense associated with shortened estimated useful lives and accelerated amortization methods for certain software and deferred contract cost assets driven by the Company's platform modernization. The incremental amortization expenses are included in the Depreciation and amortization, excluding purchase accounting amortization line item within the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation.(3)For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, this item includes a $6.8 billion impairment of goodwill related to the Merchant Solutions reporting unit due to its estimated fair value being less than its carrying value based on the price, including estimated selling price adjustments and fair value of contingent consideration, at which the Company has agreed to sell a majority stake in the unit. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, this item includes $26 million related to impairment of a non-strategic business. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, this item also includes impairment of real estate-related assets as a result of office space reductions.(4)Non-operating (income) expense primarily consists of other income and expense items outside of the Company's operating activities, including fair value adjustments on certain non-operating assets and liabilities and foreign currency transaction remeasurement gains and losses. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, this item also includes $32 million of impairment on an equity security investment which the Company agreed to sell for less than its carrying value subsequent to June 30, 2023.(5)For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, Adjusted net earnings is a gain, while the corresponding GAAP amount for these periods is a loss. As a result, in calculating Adjusted net earnings per share-diluted for these periods, the weighted average shares outstanding-diluted amount of approximately 594 million and 593 million shares used in the calculation includes approximately 2 million and 1 million shares for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, that in accordance with GAAP are excluded from the calculation of the GAAP Net loss per share-diluted for the periods, due to their anti-dilutive impact.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230802159146/en/ContactsEllyn Raftery, 904.438.6083Chief Marketing &amp; Communications OfficerFIS Global Marketing &amp; Corporate CommunicationsEllyn.Raftery@fisglobal.comGeorge Mihalos, 904.438.6438Senior Vice PresidentFIS Investor RelationsGeorgios.Mihalos@fisglobal.com]"

New launches such as chicken nuggets, and cheaper meal options like the $5 Mac &amp; Cheese Bowls and the 2-for-$5 fried chicken wrap offers helped KFC sales.Meanwhile, Taco Bell's second-quarter same store sales grew 4%, slightly below expectations of a 4.18% rise, as traffic at the chain tempered in comparison to strong demand last year driven by the launch of the Mexican Pizza.Same-store sales at Yum Brands rose 9% in the quarter ended June 30, compared with analysts' estimates of a 7.01% increase, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Excluding items, Yum Brands earned $1.41 per share, above estimates of $1.24 per share.Operating margin at KFC rose to 47.7% in the quarter from 43.2% a year earlier, while at Taco Bell, it improved slightly to 36.8%.

These include the substantial rise in menu prices, growth in average check amounts and successful expansion initiatives. Collaborations with delivery services and digital platforms are advantageous for industry operators. The consistent increase in sales reinforces the positive outlook for the restaurant sector.The restaurant industry is likely to have experienced notable gains due to the surge in off-premise sales. These sales predominantly encompass delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits, and off-site options like kiosks and food trucks. Partnerships with delivery channels like DoorDash, Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats and the rollout of self-service kiosks and loyalty programs continue to drive growth.However, restaurant operators are facing challenges related to the elevated cost of operations. High wages and food cost inflation are a concern for industry players. The aforementioned factors, rising costs of pre-opening, marketing efforts and sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure on the company's margins.Sneak Peek Into Upcoming Earnings ReleasesLet’s focus on a few restaurant companies scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug 2.According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

We expect Cheesecake Factory and North Italia same-store sales to increase 3.4% and 7.5% year over year, respectively.Story continuesOff-premise sales contributed approximately 23% of the company’s restaurant sales during first-quarter fiscal 2023 and the uptrend is likely to have continued in the second quarter.

Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Parcel Service, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Parcel Service, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Parcel Service, Inc. QuoteThe consensus estimate for U.S. Domestic Package revenues of $14,746 million suggests a 4.2% fall from the year-ago reported figure.The consensus estimate for International Package revenues of $4,759 million implies a 6.2% dip from the prior-year reported figure. Reduction in average daily volume is expected to have weighed on segmental revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Supply Chain Solutions  revenues is pegged at $3,492 million, indicating a 17.5% plunge from the year-earlier reported figure. The downfall is anticipated to have resulted from volume and market rate declines in air and ocean freight forwarding.Further, high fuel costs are likely to have dented UPS’ bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising capital expenditure also adds to its woes. Moreover, a decline in shipping volumes due to weakening demand is expected to have been concerning.

379,1c9789f1-a5af-3a63-9b7a-fafd22a9c05f,AXP,2023-08-02,"What JetBlue, Marriott earnings reveal about the consumer",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/jetblue-mariott-earnings-reveal-consumer-141743854.html,1690899463,VIDEO,"['AXP', 'MAR', 'NCLH', 'JBLU']","[Americans are looking to travel, but internationally. JetBlue is the latest domestic carrier to warn that consumers are spending less on domestic air travel. The shift to international travel is helping Marriott International though. The company's second-quarter results got a boost from international spending. As Roundhill Investments Chief Strategy Officer David Mazza tells Yahoo Finance Live ""we are seeing bifurcation at the individual company level.""Video Transcript- That brings us to our next subject, which is travel. And in particular, JetBlue. We're getting a read on the consumer and where they're traveling in a number of different travel earnings reports. JetBlue shares are up by 7%. The company slashed its outlook for the rest of the year and attributing that move to a shift toward international travel.It is more domestically oriented. It also lost its partnership with American Airlines. We also heard from some other travel companies, though, where things do look better. Marriott, for example, also reported that company beating estimates. But the shares are trading a little down, and Norwegian Cruise Line raising its earnings per share forecast for the full year.But those shares are getting punished too. So go figure. We'll see. Maybe there's some other stuff in there that is causing all of that. Dave Mazza is still with us-- Roundhill Investments Chief Strategy Officer. I know you travel quite a bit because you're based in LA. So you're flying back and forth.So it's interesting to hear what-- to see what looks like anecdotally, a travel boom all around us. And yet, it's not necessarily helping all of the travel companies equally.DAVID MAZZA: Yeah, no. Really some interesting tidbits here. So I was actually traveling on vacation a few weeks ago to Europe. Packed flights, packed hotels, couldn't get around. When I traveled most recently domestically, pretty light.And I think this is perhaps indicative of what we saw out of JetBlue most recently. Alaska also is in that camp compared to perhaps something coming out of Marriott, or even news of United creating all these mega routes, you know?Story continuesI've been on a plane for over 16 hours, but they're signing up all these 20-hour flights and everything of that nature. And what's interesting is, again, we are seeing bifurcation at the individual company level.I think JetBlue, of course, also hurt by issues with the Northeast-- Northeast Alliance that was broken up. And then-- and then the requirement like other airlines to pull back on some of this Northeast travel due to limited air traffic controllers.But again, it tells us that I think we need to be careful when we see pictures of packed airports or social media saying everything is fine. Those tickets were probably booked weeks ago or months ago.And so people are looking out and saying, hey, I'm more concerned. Well, what's going to happen around Thanksgiving or the holidays this year looking ahead? And that I think we might start to see a pullback. American Express released earnings a few weeks ago, another sort of bellwether for the consumer.Something fascinating to me came out of that, saying, they're starting to see evidence. Again, these are folks with considerable incomes who have platinum cards and the like, pulling back on some hotel and airfare, but increasing spending at restaurants both for takeout and in-person.So-- so to me, that's a sign. Again, early sign that maybe, again, there is some of a pullback of some of these big-ticket spending. But people are still feeling pretty good. They want to get out of the house, want to go to a nice dinner. So that's where they're spending as opposed to booking that-- that vacation around the holidays or to Europe next year.BRAD SMITH: Which is really interesting considering American Express saying that, but has a little bit more exposure to the corporate side too of spending. Meanwhile, you've got MasterCard that came out last week that was essentially saying, yeah, travel spending is still looking strong here. That really giving a lot of credence to what we had been hearing from some of those travel CEOs.Speaking of travel, let's talk a little more accommodations here. Opposite over at Marriott here, when we think about the company out with earnings this morning, lifting their outlook on demand for international travel and international revenue coming in better than expected in the second quarter for Marriott. They also added over 33,000 rooms globally during the second quarter here.We want to get your perspective around Marriott and the accommodation space as of right now, as travel continues to at least show no signs of slowing down immediately. But at the same time, you've got to think about how much all of these companies are spending to either bring on more capacity or just to retain that consumer too.DAVID MAZZA: Yeah. I think, again, overall theme is for now. And again, this has helped the economy in aggregate this year. Excuse me-- has been there, has been resiliency of the consumer. Resiliency of the American consumer that has propelled certain companies higher. Marriott is a great example of that. And particularly noting on that international side.So it's fascinating is that on the travel side, companies with greater international exposure are benefiting. But then to your point, in aggregate companies, perhaps in the-- other types of consumers are actually not being rewarded as much. In fact, because their earnings are-- are not as robust for other reasons.So again, American consumers bringing cash overseas, spending more there, benefiting companies exposed. But perhaps we're seeing companies and local sort of Europeans or folks living in Asia, not spending as much, not confident as much.BRAD SMITH: And on that note, we also should note for our viewers out there, don't miss Yahoo Finance's interview with Marriott's CFO, Leeny Oberg, that's coming up later today in the three o'clock hour.]"

The Merrillville, Indiana-based company, however, raised its 2023 non-GAAP guidance to the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60.In June, the company stated that the sale of its minority stake in its unit NIPSCO, for $2.15 billion to asset manager Blackstone's would cut debt and fund its transition towards renewable energy, and would close by year-end.Peer utility firm CMS Energy posted a 34.5% rise in quarterly profits last week, while Eversource Energy also beat Wall Street estimates.(Reporting by Seher Dareen in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)]"

A final order is anticipated this month from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) with rates anticipated to be effective in steps beginning in September 2023 and March 2024.Construction on the Crossroads and Dunns Bridge I solar projects was recently completed.  NiSource has now placed four utility-owned renewable investments into service from the 2018 Integrated Resource Plan process including the 2020 Rosewater and 2021 Indiana Crossroads Wind projects. This represents an approximately $800 million investment in 870 megawatts of economic, sustainable, zero fuel cost new generation for NIPSCO's northern Indiana customers. The Dunns Bridge II, Cavalry and Fairbanks Solar projects are under construction and results from the 2022 RFPs process continue to be evaluated.Gas distribution business In May, Columbia Gas of Maryland filed a request with the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) seeking approval to adjust base rates for distribution. The request seeks to recover approximately $40 million in capital invested in improving system safety and reliability through the 12-months ended July 2023.Also in May, the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) approved a settlement among Columbia Gas of Virginia and the parties in its base rate case originally filed in April 2022. The base rate adjustment approval authorizes recovery of approximately $390 million of capital invested during the 2021 through 2023 period.Columbia Gas of Ohio's Infrastructure Replacement Program (IRP) rider rates went into effect in May, initiating the recovery of $316 million of capital investment targeting safety and reliability enhancements made during 2022.These developments advance a growing track record of leading regulatory execution and highlight the benefits of jurisdictional diversity. In the last four quarters alone, NiSource has completed general rate cases in Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland with balanced outcomes for stakeholders. NiSource's scale has minimized bill impacts during a period of elevated commodity prices and general inflation, while enabling billions of dollars of investments on behalf of our customers and communities.Columbia Gas of Ohio has been awarded the Most Trusted Utility Brand Award for 2023 by Escalent for the second consecutive year. The award was given to only 42 brands across the country, and our Ohio business had the second highest score for a natural gas utility in the Midwest region.NiSource reminds investors that it does not provide a GAAP equivalent of its earnings guidance due to the impact of unpredictable factors such as fluctuations in weather and other unusual and infrequent items included in GAAP results.Additional information for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, is available on the Investors section of www.nisource.com, including segment and financial information and a presentation. About NiSourceNiSource Inc.

Another cohort of major utility stocks, including Atmos Energy ATO, Exelon EXC, NiSource NI and Entergy Corp. ETR, is set to announce earnings on Aug 2.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused utility companies are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. Favorable rate revision and customer additions have been creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure has been allowing utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities against the adverse impact of currency fluctuation. These factors are projected to contribute to this sector’s second-quarter results.Utilities have been aggressively adding more renewable and clean energy sources to their production portfolios, and cutting down the use of coal and other polluting sources in their generation portfolios.  Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades. We expect the second-quarter results from utility companies to reflect such clean energy developments.Utilities have also been focused on improving productivity and cost structures through investments in digital technologies, integrating key systems and analyzing data to make proper decisions to improve overall operations. They continue to invest smart capital that helps reduce operating and maintenance expenses and fuel costs. This, in turn, helps customers save money on utility bills. This is likely to get reflected in the customer growth rate for these utility providers in their second-quarter results.However, the fact that utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, has made their operations difficult in the current interest rate scenario. Thus, the capital-intensive utilities are likely to have experienced higher borrowing costs, thanks to the rise in interest rates from near-zero levels, which in turn might have hurt their bottom-line performance. Also, fluctuating weather conditions across major parts of the United States are likely to have unfavorably impacted the utilities’ performance in the April-June quarter.Story continuesQ2 ExpectationsTotal second-quarter earnings and revenues of Utility stocks are expected to decline 5.7% and 0.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Utilities' Earnings in FocusLet's take a look at the following utility companies that are scheduled to post their quarterly report on Aug 2 and find out how things might have shaped up prior to the announcements.Atmos Energy delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 4.92%.

Despite the revenue recovery in the first half of 2023, following gradual economic reopening in 2022, the margins were affected by these headwinds.The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. Revenues are expected to grow from introduction of new products and expansion into new markets. Some medical procedures related to heart rhythm, heart surgery, brain blood vessels and blood sugar have a high demand trend, which buoys optimism. Although the weakness in the industry's bottom line is likely to continue in the second half of 2023, the impact of rising costs is likely to alleviate as the year progresses.The industry players are increasing prices of their products and services, which is helping offset the impact of rising costs and expenses. The demand for medical products is also improving steadily in Europe and other markets. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain. However, the declining demand for COVID-19 related products continues to hurt revenues.Meanwhile, industry players like Abbott Laboratories, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Haemonetics have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their share prices.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting their top-line growth.Story continuesLockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 led to significant supply-chain disruptions. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures, along with cost-cutting initiatives, is likely to drive the industry's performance going forward.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

Each of its geographic segments and product divisions recorded year-over-year sales growth at CER. Even amid the challenging macroeconomic conditions, expansion in the company's adjusted gross and operating margins is encouraging.Despite the near-term pressure, Zimmer Biomet is putting efforts for business recovery. Meanwhile, the spin-off of its dental &amp; spine arm as part of its ongoing transformation to accelerate growth and drive value creation looks promising. The last few quarters witnessed gradual stability in the global musculoskeletal market with better-than-expected sales growth in certain geographies, banking on improved procedural volume. Following encouraging first-quarter results, the company expects revenues and adjusted earnings to grow 5-6% and 7.4-8.9%, respectively, compared with the 2022 metrics.

However, more times than not, many amateur investors fail to understand that there is often a good reason for the low price, such as poor fundamentals or slowing earnings growth.In a value trap, though the price seems low already, the fundamental issues continue to erode value over time, though they once appeared to be a bargain. Avoiding value traps requires an investor to look beyond a low valuation ratio and consider other factors.Here are signs you may be in a value trap:The Company Has ""Caretaker Management""When a company has a long and successful past, management may fall into the ""caretaker"" trap. In other words, the company has so much cash on hand, and executives get paid such large salaries that there is little motivation to grow the business. For example, in 2022, AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey hauled in more than $20 million in total compensation. Meanwhile, AT&amp;T's EPS fell from 2.63 to 2.57 per share during the same time. In fact, AT&amp;T's earnings have stagnated for years.Stick to companies that are constantly innovating, such as Apple. Though Apple is a massive company, management is always searching for opportunities. Since 2016, AAPL has nearly tripled its annual EPS by innovating and unveiling new products such as the Apple Watch and the wildly popular AirPods. In the long run, the price of a stock is directly correlated to earnings growth.Dividends May Lure You In Stocks like Verizon pay healthy dividends (7.7%). While a 7.7% dividend may be attractive to income-focused investors, investors need to remember that dividends are not paid out in a vacuum. In other words, if a stock is plummeting, even a high dividend will not lead you to profitability. For example, though Verizon's dividend has increased over the past five years, the stock is down 42%.Story continuesNot only would you be lagging if you were in a stock like VZ over that period, you would also have the added insult of injury of opportunity cost. For instance, the Nasdaq 100 is up 44.3% over the same time.GARP Is the SolutionA GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) Strategy can help investors avoid value traps by balancing growth potential and valuation. Warren Buffett holding Occidental Petroleum is a great example – the company has a history of strong earnings growth and a reasonable valuation.ConclusionSometimes, when you pay for a ""cheap stock,"" you get what you pay for. Caretaker management, slow growth, and the wrong environment could mean you're in a classic ""value trap."" Use a GARP strategy to balance growth and value and get the best of both worlds.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

If you want to see the top 5 sectors popular among smart investors, head directly to 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Long-Term. The S&amp;P 500 had a robust performance in the first half of 2023, ending June with a gain of over 6%. Overall, the index has risen almost 16% as it enters the third quarter of this year. In addition to that, as we previously reported, the NASDAQ 100 Index has skyrocketed 40% in 2023, regardless of fears about a potential bubble. In 2023, technology stocks, growth stocks, and cryptocurrencies emerged as star performers, benefiting from renewed interest in risk assets. As we enter the second half of 2023, there are signs of inflation starting to cool off. Nonetheless, market experts are skeptical that the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation are not yet complete, and there is still a possibility of the US falling into recession.In 2023, Fidelity Investments expects some consumer staples firms to outperform. Ben Shuleva, Fidelity’s sector portfolio manager, commented at the end of December 2022: “In 2023, many of the trends that emerged in 2022 will probably continue. However, consumers may be more sensitive to further price hikes than they were to previous price hikes—particularly if the economy softens further and the unemployment rate rises. Those best positioned for this backdrop may include companies that can raise prices further without losing sales volumes.”Don't Miss: Top 30 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index WeightSimilarly, precious metals like gold are considered to be safe haven assets against a backdrop riddled with inflation, devaluation of currency, and macroeconomic weakness. Eric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining UCITS ETF, told CNBC in December 2022: “Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022. It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.”Story continuesIn addition to that, Citibank analysts maintained an ""Overweight"" rating for the healthcare sector for 2023, setting aside concerns about the past year's strong performance. They emphasized the sector's defensive nature and held particular optimism about pharmaceuticals.Also Read: How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyAccording to NASDAQ’s “June, Mid-Year 2023 Review and Outlook” report, in the first half of 2023, 7 out of 11 sectors recorded gains, with Technology, Communications, and Discretionary sectors being market leaders. Technology stocks neared their previous all-time high from December 2021. While technology and growth sectors contributed significantly to the strong performance in the early months of this year, there was a noticeable shift towards cyclicals in June, possibly indicating an improvement in economic activity. All sectors ended June with positive returns. Industrials stood out with strong performance in June and continued momentum in early July, reaching new all-time highs. Housing also rebounded despite higher mortgage rates, driven by factors such as favorable demographics and migration patterns. These trends suggest positive prospects for the real estate sector as well. Some of the top stocks in the market include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). This article sheds light on some of the best sectors to invest in for the long-term. Our Methodology Insider Monkey’s first quarter database tracks the stock picks of 943 elite hedge funds.

We are reaching more patients globally with our cystic fibrosis medicines, advancing our late-stage clinical programs and making rapid progress across our research and development pipeline of transformative medicines,"" said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Vertex. ""In the second half of the year, we look forward to expanding our leadership in CF; continuing to prepare for several near-term potential launches, starting with exa-cel; and completing major Phase 3 trials including VX-548 in acute pain and the vanzacaftor triple in cystic fibrosis.""Second Quarter 2023 ResultsProduct revenue increased 14% to $2.49 billion compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S., including the launch in children with CF 2 to 5 years of age. Net product revenue in the second quarter of 2023 increased 7% to $1.51 billion in the U.S. and increased 26% to $985 million outside the U.S., compared to the second quarter of 2022.Combined GAAP and Non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, compared to $877 million and $750 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2022. The increases were due to increased investment in support of multiple programs that have advanced in mid- and late-stage clinical development, increased acquired IPR&amp;D expenses, and the costs to support launches of Vertex's therapies globally.Story continuesGAAP effective tax rate was 21.2% compared to 20.9% for the second quarter of 2022.Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.0% compared to 21.8% for the second quarter of 2022. Please refer to Note 1 for further details on our GAAP to Non-GAAP tax adjustments.GAAP and Non-GAAP net income increased by 13% and 9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by strong revenue growth and increased interest income partially offset by increased investment in our mid- and late-stage clinical pipeline, increased acquired IPR&amp;D expenses, and the costs to support launches of Vertex’s therapies globally.Cash, cash equivalents and total marketable securities as of June 30, 2023 were $12.6 billion, compared to $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by strong revenue growth and operating cash flow, partially offset by our payments to Entrada Therapeutics, CRISPR Therapeutics and other collaboration partners, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, and income tax payments.Full Year 2023 Financial GuidanceVertex is raising its full year 2023 CF product revenue guidance to $9.7 to $9.8 billion, from $9.55 to $9.7 billion previously. The increase reflects the expected full-year impact of the strong uptake of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO in multiple countries internationally and continued performance of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. This guidance includes an approximately 150-basis-point negative impact from changes in foreign currency rates, inclusive of our foreign exchange risk management program. Vertex is also increasing full year 2023 combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expense guidance. The increase accounts for higher acquired IPR&amp;D expenses incurred year-to-date, including a $70 million milestone payment to CRISPR Therapeutics.Vertex’s financial guidance is summarized below:Current FY 2023Previous FY 2023CF product revenues$9.7 to $9.8 billion$9.55 to $9.7 billionCombined GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses (2)$4.55 to $4.8 billion$4.35 to $4.6 billionCombined Non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses (2)$4.1 to $4.2 billion$3.9 to $4.0 billionNon-GAAP effective tax rateUnchanged21% to 22%Key Business HighlightsCystic Fibrosis (CF) Marketed ProductsVertex anticipates the number of CF patients taking our medicines will continue to grow, including through new approvals and reimbursement for the treatment of younger patients. Recent progress includes:Approval from the European Commission for the use of ORKAMBI in children with CF ages 1 to &lt;2 years old who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. With this approval, approximately 300 children with CF are eligible for the first time for a medicine that can treat the underlying cause of their disease.At the European Cystic Fibrosis Society’s (ECFS) European Cystic Fibrosis Conference in June, Vertex presented interim results from the largest real-world study of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, which showed sustained improvement in lung function, reduction in pulmonary exacerbations frequency and lower rates of lung transplant and death for people with CF.Approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of KALYDECO in children with CF from 1 month to &lt;4 months of age. This approval represents the first and only CFTR modulator approved for this age group. Vertex also submitted Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom, and Health Canada for the use of KALYDECO in children with CF from 1 month to &lt;4 months of age.Approval from the FDA for the use of TRIKAFTA in children 2 to 5 years of age with at least one F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to TRIKAFTA. With this approval, approximately 900 children are eligible for TRIKAFTA for the first time. Vertex also completed regulatory submissions with the EMA, the MHRA, Health Canada, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia for the use of KAFTRIO/TRIKAFTA in children 2 to 5 years of age.Potential Near-Term Launch OpportunitiesVertex is preparing for the following near-term potential new product launches:Exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel) in SCD and TDT: Exa-cel is a precise non-viral ex vivo CRISPR gene-editing therapy, which is being developed in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics as a potential functional cure for SCD and TDT.The FDA accepted the Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for exa-cel and assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action dates of December 8, 2023, for SCD and March 30, 2024, for TDT. Exa-cel's BLA for SCD was granted Priority Review by the FDA. The FDA has indicated that they plan to hold an advisory committee meeting for exa-cel. In the U.S., exa-cel has been granted Fast Track, Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations.As with the U.S. FDA, reviews of the regulatory filings for exa-cel with the EMA in the EU and the MHRA in the U.K. are well underway. Exa-cel has been granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) and Orphan Drug designation in the EU. In the U.K., exa-cel has been granted an Innovation Passport under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway from the MHRA.At the 2023 Annual European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress in June, Vertex presented positive interim results from the pivotal trials of exa-cel in SCD and TDT as of a September 2022 data cut. Both trials met the primary and key secondary endpoints at pre-specified interim analyses, and the data continue to demonstrate transformative, consistent and durable benefit. The data presented at EHA were the basis of the EMA and MHRA regulatory filings for exa-cel. Vertex expects to present updated clinical data that served as the basis of the FDA filing at a future medical congress.Dosing in the Phase 1/2/3 CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 studies is ongoing, and Vertex continues to enroll and follow patients in the CLIMB-131 long-term follow-up study.Vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, the next-in-class triple combination, in cystic fibrosis.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Vertex completed enrollment in the pivotal SKYLINE 102 and SKYLINE 103 trials, which evaluate the efficacy and safety of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor relative to TRIKAFTA in patients with CF 12 years of age and older. More recently, Vertex also completed enrollment in the RIDGELINE study of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with CF 6 to 11 years of age. Vertex expects to complete both the SKYLINE and RIDGELINE studies by the end of 2023 and share the results of these studies in early 2024.VX-548 in acute pain: Vertex has discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that have the potential to provide effective pain relief, without the limitations of opioids and other currently available medicines.Vertex continues to enroll the Phase 3 pivotal program, including two randomized controlled trials in abdominoplasty and bunionectomy and a single arm safety and effectiveness trial, for its lead compound, VX-548, for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.Vertex expects to complete the pivotal program in late 2023 and share results from these studies in late 2023 or early 2024. In the U.S., VX-548 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations for moderate to severe acute pain.R&amp;D PipelineVertex is delivering on a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative small molecule, mRNA, cell and genetic therapies aimed at serious diseases. Recent and anticipated progress for programs in clinical development is summarized below.Cystic FibrosisVertex continues to pursue next-in-class, small molecule CFTR modulator therapies, as well as an mRNA therapy for the approximately 5,000 patients who cannot benefit from CFTR modulators alone.Vertex is developing VX-522, a CFTR mRNA therapeutic, in collaboration with Moderna. The goal of this therapy is to treat the underlying cause of CF by programming cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein, and it is aimed at the treatment of the approximately 5,000 people with CF who do not produce any CFTR protein. Vertex is enrolling patients in a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial for VX-522, and the Company expects to complete the SAD and initiate a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in 2023. In the U.S., the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to VX-522.Consistent with its overall strategy, Vertex takes a portfolio approach to all of its programs and is advancing additional CFTR modulators with the goal of bringing more patients to carrier levels of sweat chloride.Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell DiseaseTwo global Phase 3 studies of exa-cel continue to enroll and dose patients 5 to 11 years of age with TDT or SCD.Additionally, Vertex continues to work on preclinical assets for gentler conditioning for exa-cel, which could broaden the eligible patient population from 32,000 patients to more than 150,000.Acute and Neuropathic PainThe Phase 2 dose-ranging study of VX-548 in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain, has been fully enrolled.Dosing in the Phase 2, 12-week VX-548 study continues, and Vertex expects to complete this study in late 2023 and share results in late 2023 or early 2024.Consistent with its overall strategy, Vertex takes a portfolio approach to all of its programs and is advancing additional NaV1.8 inhibitors as well as NaV1.7 inhibitors through research and earlier stages of development for pain.APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease (AMKD)Vertex has discovered multiple oral, small molecule inhibitors of APOL1 function, pioneering a new class of medicines that target an underlying genetic driver of kidney disease.Vertex continues to enroll and dose patients in the pivotal program for inaxaplin, a single Phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with AMKD, and expects to complete the Phase 2B dose-ranging portion of the study in 2023.Inaxaplin was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for FSGS, as well as Orphan Drug and PRIME designations by the EMA for AMKD.Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)Vertex is evaluating cell therapies using stem-cell derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells to replace the endogenous insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of developing a potential functional cure for this disease. Vertex has three programs that use these fully differentiated cells.VX-880, fully differentiated cells with standard immunosuppression: Vertex established proof-of-concept for VX-880 in 2022. In June 2023, Vertex presented positive, updated clinical data from the ongoing VX-880 Phase 1/2 study at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions (ADA). The Phase 1/2 study is designed as a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-880. In Part A, the first two patients received half the target dose of VX-880 cells. In Part B, patients received the full target dose with staggered dosing. Based on the results from Parts A and B, Vertex has initiated Part C of the study, with concurrent dosing at the full target dose, with trial sites currently active in the U.S., Canada, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France.In the data presented at ADA, all patients from Parts A and B of the study treated with VX-880 engrafted islet cells, produced endogenous insulin (C-peptide) and had improved glycemic control while reducing or eliminating insulin use. The two patients with at least one year of follow-up met the criteria for the primary endpoint of elimination of severe hypoglycemic events (SHEs) and HbA1C &lt;7.0 and also achieved insulin independence.VX-264, fully differentiated islet cells encapsulated in immunoprotective device: VX-264 uses the same stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islets used in the VX-880 program, which are encapsulated in a novel device designed to shield the cells from the body’s immune system and obviate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. Vertex is enrolling and dosing patients with VX-264 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that is a sequential, multi-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264. Part A of the study will dose patients with a partial dose of cells and a stagger between patients, and Part B will dose patients with a full target dose and a stagger between patients before moving to concurrent dosing in Part C. The study is enrolling patients in the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands, with additional global sites to be activated in the coming months. The first patient in Part A has been dosed.Edited fully differentiated cells: Vertex’s hypoimmune cell program involves using CRISPR/Cas9 to gene edit the same stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islets used in the VX-880 and VX-264 programs, in order to cloak the cells from the immune system. This is yet another possible path to eliminate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. This program is progressing through the research stage.To further expand Vertex’s capabilities in cell therapy manufacturing, in June 2023, Vertex and Lonza announced a strategic agreement to support the manufacture of Vertex’s portfolio of investigational stem cell-derived, fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cell therapy. This agreement will help accelerate the development and commercialization of Vertex’s potentially transformative cell therapy products for T1D.Alpha-1 Antitrypsin DeficiencyVertex is working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency by developing novel small molecule correctors of Z-AAT protein folding, with a goal of increasing the secretion of functional AAT into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of AAT deficiency.Vertex is enrolling and dosing patients in a 48-week Phase 2 study of VX-864, a first-generation AAT corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on polymer clearance from the liver, as well as the resultant levels of functional AAT (fAAT) in the plasma. Vertex expects to complete enrollment in this study in 2023.Additionally, Vertex continues to enroll and dose healthy volunteers with VX-634, a follow-on small molecule AAT corrector. VX-634 is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties compared to previous Vertex AAT correctors. Vertex expects to complete enrollment and dosing in this study in 2023.Muscular DystrophiesVertex is also advancing preclinical assets in muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).Investments in External InnovationAs part of the collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics on hypoimmune cells for T1D, Vertex achieved a research milestone in the second quarter of 2023, resulting in a $70 million milestone payment payable to CRISPR.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn this press release, Vertex's financial results and financial guidance are provided in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and using certain non-GAAP financial measures. In particular, non-GAAP financial results and guidance exclude from Vertex's pre-tax income (i) stock-based compensation expense, (ii) gains or losses related to the fair value of the company's strategic investments, (iii) increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) an intangible asset impairment charge and (vi) other adjustments. The company's non-GAAP financial results also exclude from its provision for income taxes the estimated tax impact related to its non-GAAP adjustments to pre-tax income described above and certain discrete items. These results should not be viewed as a substitute for the company’s GAAP results and are provided as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the company's business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and provide additional information regarding the company's financial position that the company believes is helpful to an understanding of its ongoing business. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals that are communicated internally and externally, to manage the company's business and to evaluate its performance. The company’s calculation of non-GAAP financial measures likely differs from the calculations used by other companies. A reconciliation of the GAAP financial results to non-GAAP financial results is included in the attached financial information.The company provides guidance regarding combined R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses and effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis. Unless otherwise noted, the guidance regarding combined GAAP and non-GAAP R&amp;D, Acquired IPR&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses does not include estimates associated with any potential future business development transactions, including collaborations, asset acquisitions and/or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights. The company does not provide guidance regarding its GAAP effective tax rate because it is unable to forecast with reasonable certainty the impact of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the possibility of certain discrete items, which could be material.Vertex Pharmaceuticals IncorporatedConsolidated Statements of Income(in millions, except per share

407,ed6fb565-fdb9-3348-ae4b-f59e7cdb764b,NSC,2023-08-02,"Norfolk Southern changes policy on overheated bearings, months after Ohio derailment",AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/norfolk-southern-changes-policy-overheated-170731224.html,1690909651,STORY,['NSC'],"[OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A minor coal train derailment in Virginia in early July prompted Norfolk Southern to rethink the way it responds to problems with overheating bearings, but it's not clear why the railroad didn't make similar changes months earlier after an overheating bearing caused the fiery Ohio derailment that prompted nationwide concerns about rail safety.The National Transportation Safety Board said the Atlanta-based railroad changed its rules a day after the July 6 derailment to take a much more cautious approach when a hot bearing is found. After the derailment, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen union was critical of Norfolk Southern's response because dispatchers told the crew to move the train 13 miles to a siding down the track even after the crew confirmed a bearing on one of the railcars was overheating, and that's when it derailed.The Virginia derailment that happened coming down out of the Appalachian Mountains near Elliston was relatively minor, with only 19 cars coming off the tracks and none of the coal spilling. The situation in East Palestine, Ohio, was much different with hazardous chemicals spilling from ruptured tank cars and officials deciding to blow open five other tank cars filled with vinyl chloride because they feared they might explode. The cleanup from that Feb. 3 derailment is ongoing, and area residents worry about the possibility of lingering health effects.Unlike in the East Palestine, Ohio, derailment, the Virginia train crew had enough time to stop the train safely after a trackside detector set off an alarm about the overheating bearing. The conductor walked back and confirmed the problem with a wax stick that's designed to melt anytime the temperature is above 169 degrees Fahrenheit. He also noticed grease leaking from one of the axle bearings, according to the NTSB's preliminary report.At the time the Virginia train derailed it was moving 25 mph — well below the 40 mph speed limit for the area but not slow enough to prevent the derailment.Story continuesThe new rules Norfolk Southern issued the following day said that in a situation like that when any damage is noticed on a hot bearing, the railroad will send out a mechanical inspector to look at a car before it is moved. And anytime a car with an overheated bearing is moved, the train will move no faster than 10 mph with the crew stopping at least every three miles to reinspect the bearing.Norfolk Southern spokesman Connor Spielmaker said the changes were made as part of the railroad’s effort to become “the gold standard for safety in the railroad industry” but he didn’t address why these changes weren’t made after the East Palestine derailment.“We are not going to stop until we complete the culture, process, and technology changes required to make accidents like this a thing of the past,” Spielmaker said.The railroad has announced a number of efforts to improve safety since February including an effort to work with its unions and hiring an outside consultant. Norfolk Southern’s CEO Alan Shaw emphasized those steps while testifying on Congress and apologizing for the Ohio derailment.Lawmakers are considering imposing a package of reforms on the rail industry. And the railroads themselves have announced several efforts to improve safety including installing about 1,000 more trackside detectors nationwide to help spot mechanical problems before they can cause derailments.Even with the recent safety concerns, railroads are still regarded as the safest way to transport goods across land, but the Ohio derailment illustrates that even one derailment involving hazardous chemicals can be disastrous.]"

(NYSE:KO) has set its sights on elevating various aspects of its business, aiming for sustainable volume growth and solid top-line performance. This discussion will explore Coca-cola's long-term strategies, economic challenges and impacts on pricing and revenue growth.Further, the revival of Costa Coffee marks a pivotal moment, driving growth in the ready-to-drink coffee market. Implementing a thoughtful alcohol strategy and addressing Asia-Pacific headwinds, the company remains committed to delivering excellence while maintaining stability in its global operations.Progressive outlookWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with KO. Click here to check it out. KO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of KOCoca-Cola expects to generate around $9.5 billion of free cash flow in 2023 based on nearly $11.4 billion in cash from operations and an outflow of $1.9 billion in capital investments. It signifies the company's focus on raising the bar in various aspects of it business, aiming for sustained positive volume growth and delivering solid top-line growth.In terms of pricing, the company expects to see some favorable impact throughout the rest of the year, particularly in countries with inflation rates above 20%. This is supported by the execution of Coca-Cola's long-term strategies, including marketing, revenue growth management and commercial execution in the marketplace.For 2023, the company expects organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%. However, comparable net revenues are projected to face a 3% to 4% currency headwind based on current rates and an approximate 1% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.Commodity price inflation is also expected to be a mid-single-digit percentage headwind on the comparable cost of goods sold. The company's underlying effective tax rate is estimated at 19.3%, excluding any impact from ongoing tax litigation with the IRS.Story continuesFinally, despite currency headwinds and other considerations, the company aims to deliver comparable currency-neutral earnings per share growth of 9% to 11% and comparable earnings growth of 5% to 6% in 2023, compared to $2.48 in 2022. The target looks attainable based on the progressiveness of its earnings growth year over year.A Look at Coca-Cola's Progressive Outlook and Global ExpansionThe Costa factorCoca-Cola's second-quarter performance reflected a notable recovery for its coffee segment, especially in the U.K. market. The Costa brand has shown strength in the region, mainly by expanding the Express machines and gaining a share in the business-to-business segment. However, it is important to note that the recovery in store numbers is more about completing the play on mobility and gaining share than entirely new stages of growth.Looking ahead, the company is focused on driving growth in the coffee category, with particular emphasis on ready-to-drink products. In China and Japan, ready-to-drink Costa products have made good progress, with Japan seeing positive growth in both the Georgia and Costa brands. The ready-to-drink coffee market remains essential for the company's growth strategy, especially in Japan.Internationally, the business-to-business segment is gaining traction by expanding Express machines and providing coffee machines and beans to various markets. Europe and the U.S. are key regions where the segment is finding its footing and showing promise for geographic expansion.Alcohol strategyDuring the quarter, Coca-Cola implemented an alcohol strategy, which involved setting up the Red Tree entity. However, this move does not represent a significant shift in strategy; rather, it is an optimization of the existing model. The purpose of the Red Tree entity is to provide a better platform for engaging with its partners in the U.S. It enables improved coordination and influence over marketing efforts, while ensuring a clear separation between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage brands. However, the company emphasized taking a measured approach to the alcohol segment.Despite implementing this strategy, the alcoholic segment remains a small part of Coca-Cola's overall business. However, there have been promising results in certain areas. For instance, the Jack and Coke product has exhibited favorable performance, particularly within the U.S. market. Similarly, the Simply Spiked Peach has been warmly embraced by consumers. Further, in the Philippines, notable progress has been observed with both Jack and Coke and Lemon-Dou attaining a combined market share of over 30% within the ready-to-drink category.Asia-Pacific forceIn the second quarter, Coca-Cola faced specific headwinds in the Asia-Pacific region that affected its operating margins. Destocking in the China operating unit and strong demand for juice in China and India were atypical factors that contributed to the margin pressure. However, it is essential to understand the broader context of the Asia-Pacific region's operating margins and its structural challenges.A Look at Coca-Cola's Progressive Outlook and Global ExpansionSource: Coca-Cola second-quarter earnings releaseStructurally, the Asia-Pacific geographic segment comprises mature and rapidly growing emerging markets, such as China, India and a few Southeast Asian countries. While the company's business in Japan has a good operating margin, the concentration of emerging markets with lower price points creates a negative geographic mix effect for the Asia-Pacific reporting segment. This has been a persistent feature over time, and it poses a challenge to achieving continuous margin growth in the region.Despite the structural headwind, the company is implementing various strategies to mitigate the margin pressure and optimize overall profitability. Efforts in marketing, revenue growth management and the execution of business plans are focused on offsetting the mix effect and delivering consistent performance. Over the years, the margin in the Asia-Pacific region has shown stability.Overall, it is crucial not to overemphasize one quarter's regional performance as short-term fluctuations can occur for a number of reasons. The company takes a holistic approach to managing its portfolio and strives to achieve the top end of the revenue growth target (5% to 6%), while maintaining some aggregate operating income margin expansion for the entire enterprise.TakeawayIn summary, the company's strategic focus on pricing, marketing and revenue growth management supports its ambitions amid inflationary challenges. The success of the Costa coffee segment and its measured approach to the alcohol strategy highlight Coca-Cola's adaptability and innovation.While facing headwinds in the Asia-Pacific region, the company remains resilient and dedicated to optimizing profitability. As it embraces a holistic approach, Coca-Cola confidently navigates the path to success, steering toward top-line growth and a prosperous future.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, for US$9.6m worth of shares, at about US$64.33 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$61.93. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Coca-Cola insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Coca-Cola better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Coca-Cola Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.7m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Coca-ColaI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Coca-Cola insiders own about US$1.8b worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Coca-Cola Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Coca-Cola stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Coca-Cola makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Coca-Cola you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This was primarily driven by growth in patient demand across all indications. Jakafi's sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $647 million.Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream generated $80 million in sales. The figure grew almost 384% year over year and beat the consensus estimate of $78 million. This was due to growth in patient demand and label expansion in the indication atopic dermatitis (AD).In July 2022, the FDA approved Opzelura cream 1.5% for the topical treatment of non-segmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Opzelura is also approved by the FDA for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate AD.The newly approved medicine, Zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr), generated first-quarter sales of 0.57 million. The company obtained an accelerated approval of Zynyz, earlier this March, for treating metastatic or recurrent locally advanced merkel cell carcinoma.Net product revenues of Iclusig were almost $29.09 million, up 11% year over year.

The drug is a once-daily, oral JAK inhibitor discovered by Incyte and licensed to LLY. It is approved for several types of autoimmune diseases.Adjusted research and development expenses totaled $367.9 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter’s actual, owing to higher investments in late-stage pipeline development. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $263 million, up 12% from the prior-year quarter’s number. This was due to expenses related to supporting the launch of Opzelura for the treatment of vitiligo.Incyte’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.4 billion as of Jun 30, 2023, compared with $3.1 billion as of Mar 31, 2023.2023 Guidance UpdatedBased on its second-quarter performance, Incyte updated its previously issued guidance for 2023.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart Inc. WMT, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF and Ross Stores ROST.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Intuit Inc.'s portfolio of tax-focused software transformed the company into a Wall Street giant. The firm behind TurboTax and other financial services then spent the covid boom adding to its portfolio and diversifying into email marketing and beyond.INTU shares have surged 30% YTD and they just hit new 52-week highs on July 31. Yet, Intuit still trades roughly 25% below its all-time highs and its growth outlook remains solid and steady, driven by the never-ending need for digital tax help and other various software in our digital-everything world. Intuit's pitch is simple enough: Software and taxes are here to stay no matter what the future holds.Software Everyone Needs &amp; MoreIntuit might be best known for TurboTax, but it is much more than an online tax company. Intuit sells software geared toward accounting, small business money management, and more, including QuickBooks and Mint.Intuit bought Credit Karma in December 2020 and Mailchimp in November 2021. Alongside TurboTax, accounting, and other financial services, Inuit now provides email marketing, digital-ad services, customer-relationship-management tools, credit scores, and other personal financial services.Intuit boasts over 100 customers worldwide, and it grew its revenue between 11% and 32% for seven years running—the 32% came in fiscal 2022 (up 24% excluding Mailchimp). INTU has expanded its sales from under $4 billion in fiscal 2013 to $12.73 billion in FY22 (period ended on July 31, 2022).Intuit also managed to post a nice string of big bottom-line growth for an extended period of time. Most recently, the tech firm beat our Q3 FY23 EPS estimate in late May and raised its full-year guidance.Story continuesNear-Term Outlook Intuit's FY23 revenue (period ended on July 31) is projected to climb by over 12% to jump from $12.73 billion to $14.30 billion, based on the most recent Zacks data. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to soar 20% YoY to $14.22 a share. INTU's Q4 sales are set to pop by 9.4% to boost its earnings by 25%.Peeking ahead to INTU's fiscal 2024, the company is projected to post 11% higher revenue and 9% stronger adjusted earnings. Intuit has topped our quarterly EPS estimates by an average of 28% in the trailing four quarters, with only one bottom line miss in the past five years. And its positive earnings revisions help Intuit land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Performance and Valuation Intuit stock has skyrocketed roughly 2,100% over the last 20 years to blow away the Zacks tech sector's 515%. INTU also more than doubled the tech space during the trailing decade, soaring 700%. The tax software stock continued its outperformance over the past three years as well, up 64% vs. 35%.The stock's significant outperformance came even though it has roughly matched the tech space over the last two years, with INTU down around 4%. Intuit has, however, lagged the broader Zacks tech sector so far this year, up 31% vs. 43%. Thankfully, INTU has picked up some momentum recently, surging 13% in the last month to hit new 52-week highs on the last day of July.Despite the climb, Intuit still trades roughly 25% below its all-time highs. Plus, INTU trades solidly above its 21-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. The stock also jumped back above its 50-week moving average earlier this year, following its 2022 tumble and it found support there in early June.Intuit is hardly a value stock, trading at 50.1X forward 12-month earnings. But this marks a 40% discount to its own 10-year highs. The stock's PEG ratio, which factors in its growth outlook, also showcases around 40% value vs. its decade-long high at 3.3.Bottom Line Intuit's balance sheet is solid even though it made two big acquisitions over the last several years. The company also pays a dividend (yielding 0.6% right now) that it has raised by 14% annualized over the last five years. And the company has $2 billion remaining on its current share repurchase program.Wall Street is high on the stock, with 19 of the 22 brokerage recommendations Zacks has for Intuit sitting at ""Strong Buys."" This makes sense given INTU's long history of growth in a critical, hard-to-cut-back-on area such as taxes, coupled with its expansion into new areas of business and personal finance software.Intuit is set to release its Q4 and full-year fiscal 2023 financial results on August 24.Bear of the Day:Tronox Holdings plc. is one of the leading producers of high-quality titanium products. Tronox's earnings outlook started fading quickly last year.Tronox fell short of our second quarter earnings estimates by a wide margin on July 26. TROX's EPS outlook has slipped even further since its big miss and disappointing outlook.The Tronox Basics Tronox mines and processes titanium ore, zircon, and other minerals. Tronox also manufactures titanium dioxide pigments that help add brightness and durability to paints, plastics, paper, and other everyday products.Tronox capped off a nice stretch of revenue growth between fiscal 2017 and 2021, with 30% sales expansion in FY21. Tronox's revenue then slipped 3% YoY in 2022 against that tough to compete-against-stretch. Tronox on July 26 fell short of both our adjusted earnings and revenue estimates for Q2 FY23.The firm's adjusted Q2 earnings tumbled 81% YoY to $0.16 a share, which missed our estimate by 41%. Tronox's earnings outlook took another hit following its release.Zacks estimates currently call for TROX's sales to slide 8.7% in FY23. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to fall 47% YoY in 2023.TROX's FY23 consensus estimate has dropped 27% over the last two months, with FY24's estimate 19% lower. And its most recent/most accurate estimates came in far lower. Tronox's downward earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.Bottom LineTronox stock is down roughly 40% over the last decade vs. the Zacks Basic Materials sector's 22% climb. This run included some huge swings, with TROX shares down roughly 45% from their 2021 highs.TROX stock has fallen 3% in 2023, including a significant fall since its Q2 release to take it back under its 21-day moving average. Tronox shares also slipped back below their 50-week moving average after being rejected by their 200-week not too long ago.Tronox is part of the Chemical – Diversified industry that currently ranks in the bottom 12% of over 250 Zacks industries. And it might be best for investors to stay away from Tronox at the moment and look elsewhere for winners.Additional content:Walmart's (WMT) Additional Stake in Flipkart to Fuel e-Commerce?Walmart Inc. has been making successive efforts to strengthen its e-commerce operations in the United States and internationally.

Despite the revenue recovery in the first half of 2023, following gradual economic reopening in 2022, the margins were affected by these headwinds.The Zacks Medical – Products industry bore the brunt along with broader market participants. Revenues are expected to grow from introduction of new products and expansion into new markets. Some medical procedures related to heart rhythm, heart surgery, brain blood vessels and blood sugar have a high demand trend, which buoys optimism. Although the weakness in the industry's bottom line is likely to continue in the second half of 2023, the impact of rising costs is likely to alleviate as the year progresses.The industry players are increasing prices of their products and services, which is helping offset the impact of rising costs and expenses. The demand for medical products is also improving steadily in Europe and other markets. Meanwhile, COVID-19 impacts remain uncertain. However, the declining demand for COVID-19 related products continues to hurt revenues.Meanwhile, industry players like Abbott Laboratories, Stryker, Zimmer Biomet and Haemonetics have adapted well to changing consumer preferences and are still witnessing an uptrend in their share prices.Industry DescriptionThe industry includes companies providing medical products and cutting-edge technologies for diagnosis, observation, consultation, treatment and other healthcare services. These companies are primarily focused on research and development, and primarily cater to vital therapeutic areas like cardiovascular, nephrology and urology devices, to name a few. Strengthening dollar and labor shortage are hurting their top-line growth.Story continuesLockdowns across several countries, notably China, in the first half of 2022 led to significant supply-chain disruptions. Recent inflationary pressure and labor shortages are weighing on gross and operating margins of the industry players. The trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. However, rising demand for medical procedures, along with cost-cutting initiatives, is likely to drive the industry's performance going forward.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Products IndustryAI, Medical Mechatronics &amp; Robotics: The rising adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model underscore the growing influence of AI in the Medical Products space. In fact, mechatronics — a high-end technology incorporating electronics, machine learning and mechanical engineering — is rapidly becoming a defining characteristic of the space.There are several companies that have shown substantial prowess when it comes to their involvement in AI, robotics and medical mechatronics. Advancements in robot-assisted surgical platforms continue to be crucial with respect to minimally-invasive surgery that helps in reducing the trauma associated with open surgery. With respect to Mechatronics, the benefits of the same have been demonstrated in the form of 3D printing, which has altered the face of the medical devices industry. Currently, 3D printing is being used to print stem cells, blood vessels, heart tissues, prosthetic organs and skin.Rising Demand for IVD: The COVID-19 outbreak led to a rise in global demand for diagnostic testing kits in order to curb the spread of the virus. Testing became the need of the hour and that led to a shift in the pipeline of IVD products, with a large number of rapid, point-of-care devices going into development. Companies not only received emergency use authorization from the FDA but also bolstered production to aid testing shortages. The industry players anticipate significant demand for rapid diagnostic testing in the future as well and are well poised to capitalize on the same.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Given the rising medical awareness and economic prosperity, emerging economies have been witnessing solid demand for medical products. An aging population, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure make these markets extremely lucrative for global medical device players.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Products industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #168, which places it in the bottom 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few medical product stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has underperformed its own sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 Composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 0.8% against the Zacks Medical sector's decline of 4.4%.

423,a0b06639-0643-3754-a760-7d655e622635,DVA,2023-08-02,DaVita (DVA) to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/davita-dva-report-q2-earnings-161000498.html,1690906200,STORY,"['DVA', 'MCK']","[DaVita Inc. DVA is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 results on Aug 3, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 46.3%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and lagged once, delivering an earnings surprise of 17.3%, on average.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn first-quarter 2023 earnings call in May, DaVita’s management confirmed that it witnessed an uptick in treatments per day in the quarter, driven by net census gains due to both higher admissions and lower mortality. However, management also anticipates a reduction in overall treatment volume on a year-over-year basis due to the annualization of access mortality from 2022. Management also continues to assume excess mortality in the remainder of 2023. These are likely to have weighed on DaVita’s second-quarter performance.On the same call, management confirmed that recent data continued to show an encouraging differentiation in hospitalization rates from patients in DaVita’s Integrated Kidney Care (IKC) program versus its overall patient population. This trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter, thus leading to wider enrolment in the IKC program.Management also stated that as DaVita continues to scale its IKC business, it will continue to focus on driving its net saving rate while pursuing a cost-efficient model of care. This raises optimism about the stock.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseDaVita Inc. price-eps-surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteDaVita’s continued pharmaceutical cost-saving initiatives from its anemia management transition to MIRCERA, reductions in contract labor spend and positive variability in health benefits and insurance costs also look promising for its second-quarter performance.In the first quarter, DaVita witnessed sequential improvement in U.S. dialysis treatments per day despite missed treatment rates remaining high compared to pre-COVID levels. We anticipate the improvement in U.S. dialysis treatments per day to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well, thereby boosting DaVita’s revenues.Story continuesOn Apr 1, 2023, DaVita and Medtronic announced the launch of Mozarc Medical, a new independent device company focused exclusively on innovative kidney health technologies. Mozarc's current products and its research and development pipeline, from kidney access technologies to advanced home dialysis and acute therapies, are intended to improve the overall patient experience and increase access to home-based care. This raises our optimism about DaVita.The Estimate PictureFor second-quarter 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.94 billion for total revenues calls for an uptick of 0.6% from the prior-year reported figure.The consensus estimate for EPS is pegged at $1.66, indicating a decline of 27.8% from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP has higher chances of beating estimates. This is not the case here, as you can see below.Earnings ESP: DaVita has an Earnings ESP of -5.56%.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues increased 30.1% and 7%, respectively.Vulcan Materials’ earnings topped the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters and missed on other two occasions, the average surprise being 7.1%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings per share has been revised upward to $1.91 from $1.90 over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates a rise of 24.8% from the year-ago quarter.Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS Surprise Vulcan Materials Company Price and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-eps-surprise | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteThe consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.06 billion, suggesting 5.5% year-over-year growth.Factors to NoteVulcan is likely to have generated higher revenues and earnings in the second quarter of 2023 on the back of higher spending from a number of states that it serves. Higher non-residential construction activities and incremental federal funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act are supposed to have acted as a tailwind for VMC. Also, resilient pricing across the product lines is expected to have supported the growth.The aggregates business (including crushed stone, sand and gravel, along with other aggregates) has been a major contributor to revenue growth. Efforts to enhance operational excellence, acquisition synergies and cost-control measures are expected to have aided the bottom line.Our model suggests net sales from the Aggregates segment (accounting for 78.5% of total revenues in the first quarter) to grow 6% to $1,486.3 million from a year ago.However, reduced residential demand due to lower permits and starts in single-family homes, along with railroad bottlenecks and other inflationary pressures, are expected to have ailed results. Also, higher repair &amp; maintenance costs and supply &amp; contract costs may have been risks.Our models suggest net sales from the Asphalt Mix segment (10.3% of total revenues) to be $264.8 million, indicating a 3.6% decline from a year ago. We also anticipate revenues from the Concrete segment (accounting for 17.3% of total revenues) to decline 4.7% to $402.3 million from a year ago.The Calcium segment’s net sales are expected to be $2.3 million, suggesting growth from $1.4 million a year ago.We also predict Aggregates volumes to decline 9% year over year, whereas volumes for Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium units are likely to grow 3.5%, 0.8% and 7.1% year over year, respectively.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Vulcan this time around. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: It has an Earnings ESP of -0.94%.

Ask ChatGPT What Stores Have Deals on the Appliance You WantOnce you find a brand you like, you’ll want to find out where you can find the best deals on appliances. While ChatGPT doesn’t have up-to-date information on all deal websites, it can point you in the right direction.ChatGPT Prompt“Where can I find the best deals on Bosch dishwashers?”ChatGPT ResponseFinding the best deals on Bosch dishwashers will depend on several factors, including your location, the time of year and ongoing promotions. Here are some general tips to help you find great deals on Bosch dishwashers:Authorized Retailers and Websites: Start by checking out authorized Bosch retailers, both online and brick-and-mortar stores. Popular retailers like Home Depot, Lowe’s, Best Buy and Sears… often offer competitive prices and promotions on Bosch dishwashers.Holiday Sales and Special Events: Keep an eye on major holidays and special events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Memorial Day, Labor Day and Fourth of July. These occasions often feature significant discounts and promotions on appliances, including dishwashers.Clearance Sales and Floor Models: Visit appliance stores to inquire about clearance sales and floor models. These items are often discounted to make way for new inventory, and floor models may be sold at a reduced price even though they’re in excellent condition.Online Retailers: Check popular online retailers like Amazon, eBay and Overstock for deals on Bosch dishwashers. Sometimes, online sellers may offer better prices than physical stores due to lower overhead costs.Manufacturer’s Website: Visit the official Bosch website to check for any ongoing promotions, rebates or special offers directly from the manufacturer. Bosch occasionally offers incentives, such as cash back or extended warranties.Local Appliance Stores: Don’t forget to explore smaller, local appliance stores in your area. They may have competitive prices and be willing to negotiate deals, especially if you’re purchasing other appliances or considering a package deal.Price Comparison Websites: Use price comparison websites to compare prices from different retailers and find the best deals. Websites like PriceGrabber, Google Shopping or Shopzilla can be helpful in this regard.Sign Up for Newsletters and Alerts: Consider subscribing to newsletters or setting up price alerts on websites to be notified of any upcoming deals or promotions on Bosch dishwashers.Consider Refurbished Models: Bosch-certified refurbished dishwashers can be a more affordable option without compromising on quality. Check with Bosch’s official website or authorized retailers for refurbished models.Always make sure to compare prices and read customer reviews to ensure you’re getting a good deal on a reliable Bosch dishwasher that meets your needs. Keep in mind that availability and pricing may vary depending on your location and the specific model you’re interested in.4. Ask ChatGPT How To Negotiate The PurchaseNow that you have a list of places to compare prices, the last step to getting the best deal on your appliance is negotiating the price. While this can’t really be done when shopping online, you can ask ChatGPT how to haggle a lower price when shopping in person.ChatGPT Prompt“How can I negotiate the lowest price on a dishwasher?”ChatGPT ResponseNegotiating the lowest price on a dishwasher can be an effective way to save money. Here are some tips to help you negotiate a better deal:Do Your Research: Before entering into negotiations, research the market price for the dishwasher model you’re interested in. Look for the average price at different retailers and online stores. This knowledge will give you a better idea of a fair price and provide leverage during negotiations.Compare Prices: Gather quotes from multiple retailers or online stores for the same dishwasher model. Having competing offers allows you to play one seller against another, increasing your chances of getting a better deal.Look for Sales and Promotions: Keep an eye on special sales events, holidays and promotional periods when retailers are more likely to offer discounts. Use these opportunities to negotiate a lower price based on the ongoing promotions.Consider Package Deals: If you’re purchasing multiple appliances or items from the same retailer, inquire about package deals. Retailers might be more willing to negotiate on the price when you’re making a larger purchase.Negotiate in Person: If possible, visit a brick-and-mortar store and negotiate in person. Face-to-face interactions can be more persuasive than negotiating online or over the phone.Be Polite and Respectful: Building rapport with the salesperson can be beneficial. Be polite and respectful during the negotiation process. A positive attitude can go a long way in getting the salesperson on your side.Point Out Flaws: If there are any minor flaws or cosmetic damages on the dishwasher or its packaging, point them out during negotiations. This could give you leverage to request a discount.Mention Competing Offers: If you have received better quotes from other sellers, let the salesperson know about it. Politely ask if they can match or beat the price.Ask for Discounts or Incentives: Inquire about additional discounts, such as price matching, installation discounts or free delivery. Sometimes, retailers offer incentives to close the deal.Be Prepared to Walk Away: If negotiations are not going as expected, be prepared to walk away. Sometimes, showing that you are willing to leave may prompt the seller to offer a better deal to keep your business.Consider Buying Floor Models or Open-Box Items: If the dishwasher is in good condition, buying a floor model or open-box item can lead to significant savings. Ask the retailer about any available options.Remember that negotiation success may vary depending on the retailer, current demand and the specific model you’re interested in. Stay patient and persistent, and don’t be afraid to explore different options to secure the best deal on your desired dishwasher.Bottom LineChatGPT is like your personal shopping assistant, doing instant research for you, coming up with shopping strategies and helping you negotiate a deal on whatever you want to buy. While it can’t quickly give you up-to-date prices on websites, it can give you the strategies for shopping and finding the best deal on the appliance you want.Just keep asking it questions, and it can help guide you in the right direction. But it’s up to you to negotiate and snag the best deal you can find.More From GOBankingRates22 Side Gigs That Can Make You Richer Than a Full-Time JobCan Millennials Afford To Retire If They Never Own a Home?3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement9 Best Small Business Ideas To Make Money From HomeThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Ways To Use ChatGPT To Find the Best Deals on Major Appliances]"

Nonetheless, market experts are skeptical that the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation are not yet complete, and there is still a possibility of the US falling into recession.In 2023, Fidelity Investments expects some consumer staples firms to outperform. Ben Shuleva, Fidelity’s sector portfolio manager, commented at the end of December 2022: “In 2023, many of the trends that emerged in 2022 will probably continue. However, consumers may be more sensitive to further price hikes than they were to previous price hikes—particularly if the economy softens further and the unemployment rate rises. Those best positioned for this backdrop may include companies that can raise prices further without losing sales volumes.”Don't Miss: Top 30 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index WeightSimilarly, precious metals like gold are considered to be safe haven assets against a backdrop riddled with inflation, devaluation of currency, and macroeconomic weakness. Eric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining UCITS ETF, told CNBC in December 2022: “Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022. It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.”Story continuesIn addition to that, Citibank analysts maintained an ""Overweight"" rating for the healthcare sector for 2023, setting aside concerns about the past year's strong performance. They emphasized the sector's defensive nature and held particular optimism about pharmaceuticals.Also Read: How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyAccording to NASDAQ’s “June, Mid-Year 2023 Review and Outlook” report, in the first half of 2023, 7 out of 11 sectors recorded gains, with Technology, Communications, and Discretionary sectors being market leaders.

With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”6. EnergyNumber of Companies: 6Energy sector remains one of the best sectors to invest in for the long-term.

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$59.01 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$52.08. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether LKQ's current trading price of US$54.79 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at LKQ’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for LKQ What Is LKQ Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.03% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy LKQ today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $51.19, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since LKQ’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from LKQ?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 14% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for LKQ. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in LKQ’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on LKQ, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

Both June and July were excellent months for the major indices, and while real estate investment trusts (REITs) underperformed the general indices, most still managed to finish on the positive side in July.July was an outstanding month for office REITs as three of the top four performers emerged from that sector. Short sellers who were predicting office stocks' demise were forced to run for cover as some of the office REITs were pounding out monthly gains of over 20%.Take a look at the three best-performing REITs for July (as of opening prices on 7/31) as well as six more that showed exemplary results.Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. (NYSE:HPP) is a Los Angeles-based office REIT with 49 office properties and four studio properties with an emphasis on innovation centers for media and tech companies in California, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia.Hudson Pacific Properties was founded in 2006 by Chairman and CEO Victor Coleman. Soon after its creation, Hudson Pacific began purchasing motion picture studios and office buildings on the West Coast. Hudson Pacific Properties went public in 2010. It has a market cap of $690.43 million. The 52-week range is $4.08 to $16.31.Hudson Pacific Properties led all REITs in performance for July with a gain of 38.11%.Sotherly Hotels Inc. (NASDAQ:SOHO) is a Williamsburg, Virginia-based hotel REIT that owns and manages 3,011 rooms in 12 hotels across the southern United States. Sotherly initial public offering (IPO) was in 2004, and it has a market cap of $93.028 million.Sotherly Hotels had an occupancy rate of 70.6% in June, which was 4.1% better than June 2022. Average daily rates (ADR) of $178.46 was 3.3% better year over year and revenue per available room (RevPar) of $124.79 was 7.7% better year over year.Things have recently been improving for Sotherly Hotels, which had performed poorly from the onset of COVID-19 in 2020. Sotherly Hotels was the second-best REIT performer in July with a gain of 28.93%. Story continuesSL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) is a New York City-based office REIT and the largest office building landlord in New York. As of June 30, SL Green Realty held interests in 60 buildings totaling 33.1 million square feet. Many income-oriented investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.On July 19, after the closing bell, SL Green Realty reported its second-quarter operating results. Funds from operations (FFO) of $1.43 was down 23.53% from FFO of $1.87 in the second quarter of 2022 but beat the estimates by $0.09. Rental revenue of $165.65 million was better than rental revenue of $136.5 million in the second quarter of 2022. Total revenue of $221.07 million was above estimates of $205.97 million.Analysts are unusually divided with ratings and price targets for SL Green Realty. On July 26, Goldman Sachs maintained its Sell rating on SL Green Realty but raised the price target from $19 to $25. Yet, the day before, Truist Securities maintained a Buy rating while lowering the target price from $50 to $47. A few days before that, Morgan Stanley reiterated an Equal-Weight rating and maintained a $21 price target on SL Green. Also in July, Piper Sandler Cos. upgraded SL Green from Neutral to Overweight and raised its price target from $27 to $41.Despite Goldman Sachs' negative call, SL Green was the third best-performing REIT in July with a gain of 24.13%.Trending: This REIT You’ve Never Heard Of Is Crushing The Market – Up 36% Over The Past Two YearsOther solidly performing REITs in July were:STOCKSYMBOLJULY GAINVornado Realty Trust(NYSE:VNO)22.21%Kilroy Realty Corp.(NYSE:KRC)18.63%Empire State Realty Trust Inc.(NYSE:ESRT)18.87%Uniti Inc.(NASDAQ:UNIT)17.80%Paramount Group Inc.(NYSE:PGRE)17.59%Boston Properties Inc.(NYSE.BXP)14.77%Given the unusually large gains over one month's time, investors who are interested in purchasing these REITs may want to wait for pullbacks in price before entering new positions.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

It seems to me there's a very close parallel between what happens to malls and what is now happening to office. Five years or so ago, there was universal certainty that mall and brick-and-mortar REIT were dead forever, the victim of ubiquitous and explosively growing e-commerce. Capital markets shut down, no new malls were built. But behold today, 5 years later, malls are booming. Sound familiar? It seems to be that CBD office in all our cities, New York included, has fallen victim to the same emotional and shortsighted view in the investment community. Work from home is to office what the Internet was to retail. We believe in office work is the better bet and a little time frozen capital markets, and no new supply will restore value and glory to office. Malls and office and the center cities of America are not going away. Our business is continuing to perform well and on plan in this environment. Michael will cover the math and give color in a moment. The principal difference in our numbers this year to last year is the rise in interest rates. Overall, the economy has been more resilient than we expected in the face of the Fed's historic interest rate hikes. Real estate capital markets remain challenged even for us. Highlights of our immediate business plan are to conserve cash and protect our balance sheet and even to raise cash by accretively selling select assets to reduce debt and buy back stock, and for us, the Penn District continues to be the main event. At Farley, PENN 1 and PENN 2 come online, they will create significant growth and shareholder value with much more to come. Over the last few months, we bought back 2,025,000 shares for $29 million at an average price of [$14.40] Sam Zell passed away on May 18. There was a memorial service in his honor in Chicago 3 weeks ago. Over 1,000 people attended. I gave a eulogy. It could be said that Sam was the father of the publicly traded REIT market. He called it liquid real estate. I wish us all to be as smart and as accomplished and live life as large as Sam did. I apologize in advance, but Glen and I must leave at 11:15 for a tenant meeting. Now over to Michael to cover our financials and the market.Michael J. FrancoThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Though down from last year, we had a solid quarter as it relates to our core business. Second quarter comparable FFO as adjusted, was $0.72 per share compared to $0.83 for last year's second quarter, a decrease of $0.11 or 13.3%, driven primarily by expected higher net interest expense from increased rates. In addition, there were several nonrecurring items in the quarter that essentially offset each other. Those items include $0.07 of termination income from a former tenant at 345 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, offset by $0.02 of additional interest expense related to the restructuring of the St. Regis retail loan, which is forgiven by the lenders, but is required to be recognized by GAAP and $0.04 of additional stock compensation expense related to the new compensation plan we implemented in June. We have provided a quarter-over-quarter bridge in our earnings release and in our financial supplement. Notwithstanding the headwinds from higher interest rates and the impact from nonrecurring items, our core office and retail businesses remain resilient with long-term credit leases. Our New York Cash same-store office business was up 3%, and our New York business overall was up 2.7%. With respect to the remainder of 2023, you'll recall that we previously said that we expect 2023 comparable FFO to be down from 2022 and provided the known impact of certain items totaling a $0.55 reduction, primarily from the effect of rising interest rates. Our outlook hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. Though with the additional recurring expense related to the new share-based awards granted in June, you can expect an additional G&amp;A expense of approximately $0.05 in total for the rest of the year. For 2024, the incremental impact of the plan versus our prior year run rate is $0.02 to $0.03 overall. Of course, our expectation of FFO is absent the impact of any potential additional asset sales. Now turning to the leasing markets. Against the backdrop of the Fed sharp interest rate increases, we continue to be encouraged by the level of activity year-to-date. Leasing activity has been led by strong demand from traditional industries, financial services and law firms, in particular, with many financial firms growing their footprint and accounting for almost 40% of the 5.2 million square feet leased in the quarter. Overall, tenants in the market continue to be focused on the highest quality new or redeveloped Class A buildings that are well amenitized, have strong sponsorship and our near transportation in Midtown and the website. Which is resulting in rents moving up in these buildings. Our office portfolio is filled with these types of buildings. Midtown accounted for 70% of this quarter's leasing activity with 75% of Midtown leasing occurring in Class A properties, reinforcing the flight to quality theme. For companies, it's all about tenant attraction and retention and creating culture and they are willing to pay more for the right work environment that will help accomplish these objectives. Taking rents in top-tier buildings are at peak levels and the delta between Class A and Class B properties continues to widen. While there is solid activity in the market, large requirement deal flow is lagging, concessions remain stubbornly high. Focusing on our portfolio. During the second quarter, we completed 19 leases, totaling 279,000 square feet with very healthy metrics, including starting rents at $91.57 per square foot and a positive mark-to-market of 5.7% cash and 9.9% GAAP. Overall, for the first 6 months of the year, we have signed 1 million square feet of leases at a market-leading $99 per square foot. Our average starting rents continue to trend up, evidencing the quality of our portfolio and the continued flight to quality we've discussed. At PENN 1, we continue to execute a steady stream of leases with new top-tier tenants at attractive rents, reflecting tenants attraction to the unique amenity offering we have in the most successful location in the city. Last quarter, we signed a lease with Samsung at the building. This quarter, we signed a 72,000 square foot lease with Canaccord Genuity, a leading financial services firm. Tour activity is picking up at PENN 2 as well now that the project is nearing completion and tenants can better appreciate the redeveloped product. PENN 1 and PENN 2 now compete in the very top tier of the marketplace, in most cases versus new construction to the west of us at Manhattan West and Hudson Yards. This is a testament to the marketplace's reception to these 2 market-leading projects as well as confidence in the future of Penn District as the new epicenter of New York. Overall, we have very good activity in many of our assets, including strong deal volume at 1290 Sixth Avenue and 280 Park and at higher rents than we previously forecasted. Here's the headline. Industry insiders understand there's a shortage of good space on Park Avenue and Sixth Avenue. Actual vacancy is below 10% and rents are moving up nicely. There are certain competitive pockets in the market, such as these, where there is a healthy tenant landlord equilibrium, allowing us to push rental rates higher in our best-in-class buildings. Our leasing pipeline in New York is strong and not reflective of the media's negative office narrative. We have 580,000 square feet of leases in negotiation, plus an additional 1.2 million square feet in our pipeline. This activity is well balanced in buildings where we have current vacancy and known vacancy where space is coming back to us over the next 18 months and is a good mix of new deals, renewals and expansions. The financial sector, in particular, continues to be the most active. Much of our retail leasing this quarter occurred in the Penn District, primarily a mix of food and fitness activations, as we continue to curate the district like no other neighborhood in the city. We are excited about the best-in-class operators we are bringing to the district. And more importantly, both our current and prospective office tenants are really enjoying everything we have done we have recently announced. We have much more than the words here. Turning to the capital markets now. The financing markets remain highly constrained, particularly for office, driven by volatility from the Fed sharp rate increases. There's more appetite for retail as this asset class is perceived to have bottomed. Banks are dealing with an increase in problem loans, regulator scrutiny and lack of loan attrition and thus they remain cautious and constrained in lending. The tone of the CMBS market has improved modestly in the past quarter, but is still largely closed. High-quality sponsorship is more important than ever. We are in good shape though. We have no material maturities until mid-2024. During the quarter, we completed the restructuring of the St. Regis retail loan, adding 5 years of term and also extended a couple of smaller loans that had near-term maturities. We are actively working with our lenders to push out the maturities on our loans that mature in 2024 and beyond. Our mantra remains consistent as we continue to review the portfolio. If an asset is overleveraged or not refinanceable, we will support the asset only if we have sufficient term for the asset or markets to recover. We were able to do this because the loans are secured by individual assets and are generally non-recourse. We have found the banks to be cooperative in working through these situations thus far, servicers, TBD. You will see in our financials that we continue to push out our interest rate hedges, giving us good protection over the next few years from future increases. Finally, we continue to be active in selling assets and recently announced the sale of 4 small retail assets in Manhattan, which don't produce much FFO closing in the third quarter and the Armory Show, which closed in July. We are hard at work on others as well. In these volatile times, we remain focused on maintaining balance sheet strength. Our current liquidity is a strong $3.2 billion, including $1.3 billion of cash and restricted cash and $1.9 billion undrawn under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facilities. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.Stephen Thomas SakwaMichael, I was wondering if you could maybe just comment or elaborate a little bit more on the leasing pipeline that you talked about. And how much of that relates to kind of the lease-up of 2 PENN, and then also just on the New York leasing, the spreads were reasonably good. I'm just wondering how much of the leasing in the quarter was at PENN 1 where I know you're achieving very strong uplift.Michael J. FrancoSteve, I'm going to turn over to Glen to tackle that I'll follow up if necessary.Glen J. WeissSteve, it's Glenn. So in terms of the quarter, about 40% of the activity was at PENN 1, including the headline Canaccord deal. As it relates to the pipeline, a very strong pipeline, almost 600,000 feet of leases out, another 1.2 million in the works. I sketched out this morning, my calendar for the week. We've got a final LOI, the final innings for a 320,000-foot tenant. We're getting a lease out for another 240,000 foot tenant. We responded to an LOI for 275,000 feet and we're deep in term sheets with another firm for 175,000 feet. So we're busier than we've been, doing much better as we go, which we predicted. We do have very good action also at PENN 2 at this point, lots of tours. We have some proposals in the house, project is showing very well, and we feel great about PENN 2 coming out of the shoot later this year.Stephen Thomas SakwaOkay. And maybe a question for Steve or Michael. Just as you think about the dividend, I know you sort of put the dividend at least on the back burner as you sort of contemplated asset sales and you've got a few that you talked about, some of these retail assets in the Armory. I guess, are there other larger assets that you're contemplating, bringing to market between now and the end of the year? And I guess, just sort of what's the updated thought on the dividend and then the pace of buybacks.Michael J. FrancoSteve. So the answer is, I think we talked on the last call, we're going to be opportunistic about looking to sell assets. We obviously announced a few small ones last week. We're working on some others. There could be a couple of larger ones. I can't play the tax impact yet. I think in total, by the way, on the ones we just sold, there'll be a tax loss on those. So that will reduce taxable income. And as we've said historically, our policy is to pay taxable income, we'll evaluate where we end up at the end of the year in terms of cash versus stock mix. Our objective, I think, has been to retain cash, utilize it for buyback, utilize it to pay down debt. But we'll see at the end of the year. And while other things get done before the end of the year, possibly, but it's all these things have a pace of when they can get done. And so I can't tell you anything else large is going to get done definitively by year-end, but we're working on some things.OperatorThe next question is from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America.Jing Xian Tan BonnelMichael, you provided commentary around the mark-to-market opportunity for 1290 Avenue of Americas. Are you able to quantify this for the rest of your expiries through 2024? Are the market opportunities there positive? Or are there any meaningful unique leases that are above market rents?Glen J. WeissIt's Glen Weiss. As usual, it's hard to predict the mark-to-markets quarter-to-quarter because that will depend on our activity. As Michael said, we're really right now really pleased with the rent levels we're seeing at the buildings where we have major expiries coming, whether it's 1290, 770, 280 or otherwise, but it's hard to predict where they're going to lay out, but we feel good about the rents. And our starting rents have been extremely strong and consistent for the last, I think, 2 years in the '80s, even 90s, this year of the 1 million feet we've leased, our starting rents are $99 a foot. So it shows just the quality of our buildings, the pace of our leasing is picking up. So on the mark-to-market, I can't really predict exactly what's going to happen here, but we feel our rents are top-tier throughout, and we're making matches everywhere right now.Michael J. FrancoI would just add that I think it's hard to predict. And even as we sit here, it's August, right? And so as we look at the activity, we talk about the submarkets like Park Avenue, Sixth Avenue for the Class A buildings. Rents are up double digits from 6, 9 months ago, right? And so if you had asked us 6, 9 months ago where the mark-to-market be on some of those leases, they wouldn't have been as strong as they're turning out to be or what's in the pipeline. So to sit here and tell you what they may be in 2024, we can't predict. But I think what you're hearing from us is that I think it's a really important point, right? One of this -- spend a lot of time with counterparties talking about is sort of separating fact from fiction, right? The negative narrative that it's on the front pages every day versus what's actually going on in the field. And in these key submarkets in the better buildings, you're at an equilibrium level, right? You're sub 10% vacancy. And so it's allowing us to really put rents in those buildings, in those submarkets. And that is where a lot of our expiries are occurring this year, next year. And so we feel good about it. So where it will end up, I can't tell you, but I think there's positive momentum there.Jing Xian Tan BonnelThat's very helpful. And I assume those comments around market rents being up over the last 6 months on a gross basis. So any update on how that's trended on the TI and rent free side?Glen J. WeissThe concessions are still stubbornly high, too high. So the rents have continued to inch up on the best of our buildings, concessions have remained where they've been.OperatorThe next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbSteve, quite the honor for you to give the eulogy for Sam. So I have 2 questions. The first question is the new comp plan that you guys rolled out, one, are you terminating the old comp plan? And two, just the thought process, you put it out like 4:30 ahead of July 4 weekend. And just curious why it wasn't done as part of the annual proxy. Normally, companies will update comp plans at the start of the year. You guys did it mid-year. So just want to get some thinking about how you're looking at that, the decision that went into making it in the midyear and then are you terminating the old plan?Steven RothI want to -- Alex, I want to handle your comment about we snuck it out (inaudible) on a Friday. The fact of the matter is, is that the SEC regulations say, when you do something like that, you have to file an 8-K within 48 hours. So that turned out to be on that particular Friday. So we had to get it out. The second thing is our teams that handle this are used to a 4:00 closing. So they put it out after what they told me the 4:00 closing without really realizing that because it was pre-holiday, the markets would close at 1:00. So we're not in a sneaky business, and we did what we had to do. The rest of your question, Michael can handle.Michael J. FrancoSo let me take them in pieces. Return in the old comp plan, the answer is no, that plan will expire. I think in 2025, as we sit here today, it doesn't look like it will earn, but we'll see. And it's not a big number either way. In terms of the comp plan now, why do it now? Look, I think our view was we felt it was -- we're in a challenging period. And we lost a few key people over the last few years or a few people, I should say. And we felt it was an important message to send to our team to put in place a plan that both incentivizes retention as well as rewards for performance during this period and coming out of this period. And so we put a plan in place. We think it's a great plan for shareholders, by the way. It requires sustained performance over a meaningful period of time. And so if the stock price goes up, obviously, the plan is more valuable and pieces of it don't even invest in until performance is achieved much higher than the price at which it was awarded. So it's very (inaudible) performance, we think it's great for shareholders, and we think it's great for the team. So the reaction in the team has been extraordinary. It was allocated to a broad group of people. We think we've ensured stability of the team for the next several years, which is important, important for shareholders. And frankly, our shareholders have been I think very helpful both in constructing the plan on the front end and follow up after. So (inaudible) January, we want to put in place now, make a very strong message to our team about the importance of if we drive value over time, what is there for everybody to receive and to get people excited and that's been the exact reaction, and I'm confident that we have a broad group of people that are even more laser-focused on how we're going to drive the stock race.Steven RothIt's important to note that Michael and others on our team communicated broadly with our largest shareholders in constructing this plan and got universal support from our shareholders, and so that's a very, very good thing. We have gotten also universal positive commentary from our peers in the industry about what we did, why we did it and what a good idea that was.Alexander David GoldfarbOkay. And then the second the follow-up question, Steve, the studio deal on Pier 94. Just curious of more details, is Hudson going to be the main operator, what are the economics, what is your role? I mean obviously, you have a deep theatrical background in your family. So just more details on the economics and how the operations will run between you guys, Victor and Blackstone.Steven RothWe're not 100% finished with all the details on this deal. So we're not going to get into that. So what it is, basically, it will be the only studios in -- on the island of Manhattan. So we're extremely enthusiastic about it. We have half the deal. We came in with the land and Hudson Pacific is the operator and Blackstone is Hudson Pacific's partner, and now our partner. So there'll be more about that as we consummate this.OperatorThe next question is from Julien Blouin with Goldman Sachs.Julien BlouinI guess just at a high level, I was wondering if you could give us any insight into leasing activity in San Francisco and Chicago. Maybe how you would compare those 2 markets, which of them is in better shape right now.Glen J. WeissIt's Glenn. San Francisco, we've been fortunate enough, we've been very successful with 555 Cal, even given the markets which are quiet. There's very little new tenant demand in San Francisco, but we've been very insulated in a very successful way with 555. Chicago, I would say, is a different story that there is a lack of tenant demand, particularly big tenants. The action we have at the more is 100,000 feet and less tenant variety. The market there, I'd say is more quiet. But I think both cities generally, there is a lack of demand. There is uncertainty as it relates to the cities and the government. So I would say the kind of equal as it relates to the action. For us, specifically, Vornado we're in great shape in San Francisco, Chicago. We got a lot of space to lease. We had expirations that we're grappling with right now. We're feeling better. We just completed work-life program. We just had a huge broker of that last Wednesday night, which was a huge success. So we're now our way, but we got a lot of wood to chop.Steven RothI would add a couple of comments. In San Francisco, we see -- we own the premier financial services building. So we are sort of different than all of the supply of technology building and so all of the important financial services, tenants and clients are in our building and have been there for 25 years and more. So the building is sort of unique, it's the highest quality, and it's by far the most important financial services building. So it's a great piece of real estate. In Chicago, similarly the building -- it's a great piece of real estate. The market is a little bit soft, and we're navigating that now.Julien BlouinThat's very helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I may have missed it in the answer to Steve Sakwa's question, but what were the New York office leasing spreads in the quarter, excluding PENN 1?Michael J. FrancoYes. I don't know we have that off hand. Well, we'll have to come back to you on that, Julien.Steven RothWe don't have that at our fingertips. We'll get back.OperatorNext question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.Anthony PaoloneYou talked earlier about maybe selling some more stuff over the rest of the year. But if we look out the next 2 or 3 years, is there a part of the portfolio that you'd really like to get rid of, if you can or should we think about just any part of the business shrinking, whether it's retail or certain submarket.Steven RothThere is no target on a particular type of our assets. I mean we're fairly concentrated in New York, in office and our retail is extremely unique. So we don't have a target on any particular division of our business. We don't have very many divisions. The office company headquartered in New York. We have a great building in San Francisco, another great building in Chicago and a retail presence on the most important streets in New York City. So we don't have a target. On the other hand, if we can sell assets for prices which are accretive to our stock and create shareholder value, that's something that we are looking at very intensely.Anthony PaoloneOkay. And then second one, just on NOI as we think about the second half of the year. In retail, the first couple of quarters were very consistent and you did a lot of leasing. So just what should we expect in the second half there? And then in office, it seemed like there was a big balance in the GAAP NOI 1Q to 2Q. And same question, just kind of how to think about second half.Steven RothAre we predicting the second half? I don't think so. So we're not forecasting or guiding for the second half. So that's a premature question. Sorry.OperatorThe next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoI just wanted to go back to the asset sales. And I want to ask specifically about the Farley Building and whether you're contemplating any plan there to sell a joint venture stake in the asset. Just -- it seems like the type of asset would gather good investor demand, long-term lease with a strong credit tenant to a lot of success there. So any thoughts on that you can provide?Steven RothWe like the assets just as much as you do. And we're not going to comment on its future.Nicholas Philip YulicoOkay. I guess secondly, on Farley as well as -- I don't know if -- there's no mortgage there. So I don't know if that's also an asset that you're considering putting a mortgage on it, if you've had any conversation with banks, be sort of an interesting test case for a strong office building and the ability to finance it. Any thoughts you could share there?Steven RothI mean, we agree with you. It's a very strong asset with a very strong long-term lease on it. It's arguably one of the best buildings of its type and kind in the city. It has no mortgage. It has (inaudible). It has no financing on it. So obviously, it's a great asset and could be an important source of liquidity.OperatorThe next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemJust 2 quick ones. So on the $0.72 of FFO in the quarter, can you just remind us what is a one-timer that we need to adjust for, what is recurring? So both is there any sort of lease termination or anything like that, so we can get the right sort of run rate?Michael J. FrancoYes. Ronald, I think there's a lot that goes in every quarter, right? It's one time, it's up, down, it's small. I think this quarter, probably a little more significant one timer from the tenant termination at 345 Montgomery, which was (inaudible). At the same time, we had a couple of cents that was related to St. Regis loan restructuring where the interest that was accrued during that default period was forgiven, and we were required to recognize that by GAAP, right? So that nets down to $0.05. And then on the stock comp, that will continue, as we said for the rest of the year, but be probably a lesser incremental amount for next year. So net-net, let's call it $0.05 this quarter that's true nonrecurring and the stock comp will decline a little bit as we get into next year.Ronald KamdemGreat. Okay. So got it. So 72 down to 5, 67, got it. So just on the last one, just on the leasing. You talked about, I think, 5A in negotiation 1, 2 in the pipeline. Can we put that all in the blender. So how should we think about occupancy going from here, right? Is it flat? What are sort of the puts and takes you're thinking about the occupancy for the rest of the year and into next.Glen J. WeissI'd say occupancy for the rest of the year, we'll hover around the (inaudible) now it depends when these deals happen, when they close and how everything goes here. So I think we will be pretty much at these levels over the next couple of quarters. But I'm hoping to see more absorption as we go based on getting these deals done over the next 3, 6 months or whatever it will be.Michael J. FrancoLook, I think Glen and his team are doing a great job on some of the expiries that are coming up. Some of this will be timing when those deals are -- I mean, we have some known move-outs, for example at 1290 to 280 and the extent we backfill those, then occupancy won't dip to the extent that there's a timing gap in terms of when it's backfilled, it will dip. So I agree with Glenn's comments around here where it will stabilize. But could it go down a little bit at the beginning of next year, depending on timing of whether we have the spec-build? It could. So I wouldn't hold your breath saying it's going to stay exactly 91% change from here on out. It may go down a little bit, but we're confident that with time, that space will get backfilled and the occupancy will get rebuilt.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. So this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Steven Roth for any closing remarks.Steven RothThanks, everybody, for attending. This is a record. I mean we've never done a call that was 35 or 40 minutes before. So in any event it's a record and is kind of surprising. We'll see you in 3 months on the next call. Have a great day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

450,f72987aa-2c24-3efb-87b7-73a70941d919,DHI,2023-08-02,5 Top Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-likely-beat-105700740.html,1690973820,STORY,"['DHI', 'COTY', 'BJRI']","[It is not surprising that before an earnings season, every investor looks for stocks that are likely to beat market expectations. This is because investors always try to position themselves ahead of time and look to tap stocks that are high-quality in nature.In this regard, we ran a screener that yielded Coty COTY, BJ's Restaurants BJRI, DexCom DXCM, Livent LTHM and D.R. Horton DHI as the likely winners on the earnings beat potential.Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important?Historically, stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings (on a nominal basis) tank if they miss or merely meet market expectations. After all, a 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn’t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend.Also, seasonal fluctuations come into play sometimes. If a company’s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.On the other hand, after much brainstorming and analysis of companies’ financials and initiatives, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. They in fact club their insights and a company’s guidance when deriving an earnings estimate.Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company’s own expectation as well as the market perception. And if the margin of earnings surprise is big, it typically drives the stock higher right after the release. Thus, more than anything else, an earnings surprise can push a stock higher.How to Find Stocks that Can Beat?Now, finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors’ dream but not an easy job. One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company.An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company’s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release.Story continuesThe Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.In addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) rating can get through.Earnings ESP greater than zero: A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen, as per our proven model.In order to zero in on those that have long-term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too:Next 3–5 Years Estimated EPS Growth (Per Year) greater than 10%: Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock’s long-term growth prospects.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.A handful of criteria has narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to only 17.Here are five out of 17 stocks:Coty (COTY): The Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of beauty products. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of COTY for the past four quarters is 145.0%.BJ's Restaurants (BJRI): The Zacks Rank #1 company owns and operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States.The average earnings surprise of BJRI for the past four quarters is 121.2%.DexCom (DXCM): The Zacks Rank #2 medical device company is focused on the design, development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems.The average earnings surprise of DXCM for the past four quarters is 28.83%.Livent (LTHM): The Zacks Rank #1 company produces and distributes lithium chemicals.The average earnings surprise of LTHM for the past four quarters is 22.07%.D.R. Horton (DHI): The Zacks Rank #2 company is one of the leading national homebuilders, which is primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets.The average earnings surprise of DHI for the past four quarters is 23.97%.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

(NASDAQ:AAL)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-american-airlines-113344020.html,1690976024,STORY,['AAL'],"[Let's talk about the popular American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL). The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine American Airlines Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for American Airlines Group Is American Airlines Group Still Cheap?Great news for investors – American Airlines Group is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 4.03x is currently well-below the industry average of 22.67x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because American Airlines Group’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from American Airlines Group?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. American Airlines Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 61%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since AAL is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy AAL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed assessment.If you want to dive deeper into American Airlines Group, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

454,47c5becb-186e-3e3f-83dc-53d5b30510fb,AAL,2023-08-02,JetBlue Will Pay Dearly to End its Alliance With American Airlines,Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jetblue-pay-dearly-end-alliance-173847053.html,1690911527,STORY,"['JBLU', 'AAL']","[JetBlue Will Pay Dearly to End its Alliance With American AirlinesJetBlue Airways was always going to lose some revenue by ending its alliance with American Airlines in the northeastern U.S. The hit, disclosed Tuesday, is big and will cut the carrier’s full-year profit per share outlook down by at least a fifth.The New York-based airline expects ending the alliance, known as the “NEA,” will reduce full-year earnings per share, a measure of profits, by $0.20-25 in 2023. To put that in perspective, JetBlue in April forecast full-year earnings per share with the alliance to be $0.70-1.00. Now, it expects the profit metric to be a measly $0.05-0.40 in 2023 after ending the alliance. The air traffic control staffing-related cancellations in New York and the shift in travel patterns to international trips this summer also weigh on the airline’s full-year outlook.“Our decision to terminate the NEA will result in a near-term drag on margins as we lose key codeshare revenue,” JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said Tuesday. And, in addition to lost revenue, costs related to the alliance will “linger” due to the slow wind-down of the pact, he added.JetBlue and American began unwinding their alliance on July 21 when both carriers stopped taking new bookings under the pact. Many expect a so-called “drain down” end to the partnership where all existing bookings drain out of the system as no new ones are taken. The decision to end the alliance followed a federal judge’s ruling in May that found it to be in violation of U.S. antitrust law and ordered the pact terminated.American, for its part, plans to appeal the ruling. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier has said the end of the JetBlue alliance is not “material” on its full-year financial outlook.“As we head into 2024, we will be able to mitigate the impact as we are increasingly able to redeploy capacity currently underperforming in NEA markets to high-margin leisure opportunities throughout our network,” Hayes said on the longer-term outlook. He and other executives were not more specific on where that Boston and New York capacity could go, however, the airline is strong in large leisure markets like Florida and the Caribbean.Story continuesThe Boston flight reductions have already begun, JetBlue Head of Revenue and Planning Dave Clark said. New York reductions, particularly at LaGuardia airport where the airline leased 36 slot pairs from American, will occur slowly with a “handful” of flights coming out this winter, and about half of the added flights ending next March. JetBlue has just 16 slot pairs of its own at LaGuardia.The news came after a reasonably strong second quarter for JetBlue. The airline posted a $235 million operating profit, and a 9% operating margin. Revenues increased nearly 7% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, and unit revenue, measured in RASM, was up nearly 1%. Recall, similarly U.S. domestic-exposed Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines both saw unit revenue declines in the June quarter. And on the other side of the ledger, unit costs, measured in CASM, excluding fuel increased 3.5% year-over-year in line with JetBlue’s guidance.New York Schedules May Need to be Cut More to Avoid Delays“Our 10% schedule reduction in the New York area airports, it was still not enough to overcome the combined weather and more restrictive [air traffic control] programs,” Geraghty said. In June and July, the airline faced 30 straight days of some form of air traffic control or weather-related capacity restriction at its New York JFK hub. And while United Airlines grabbed headlines for its challenges across the Hudson River at Newark, JetBlue’s large concentration of capacity in New York meant it as a whole was more affected by the situation.Looking ahead, Hayes expects air traffic control and weather disruptions to continue in New York through August. And, he told analysts that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration may need to waive slot usage rules in New York for more than just 10% of slots next summer. But the truth remains the same: there’s a shortage of air traffic controllers, particularly in New York, and that will persist for at least several years until the FAA can staff back up.Europe Demand Is GreatJetBlue is seeing green to Europe. Its flights to London, Paris, and Amsterdam beginning August 29 are driving the “strongest” revenue growth across the airline’s network, Geraghty said. The problem is JetBlue just doesn’t have much capacity to Europe. Only 3% of its system capacity, measured in ASMs, will be on transatlantic routes in the third quarter, according to Cirium Diio schedules. The airline plans to grow more on the water jump next year to “diversify geographically,” as Geraghty put it, but that is limited by how many new, long range A321LR and XLR planes Airbus can deliver. JetBlue already expects only around 30 new aircraft — including both Airbus A220s and A321neos, LRs, and XLRs — in 2024 compared to contracted deliveries of more than 40 planes.Domestic Yields Are FallingAs Alaska and Southwest already highlighted, U.S. domestic airfares have peaked. But JetBlue took it one step further: “While load factors remain very strong, we’ve seen fares normalizing back towards 2019 levels,” Geraghty said. Alaska and Southwest, mind you, have only said fares are declining from last year’s peaks and not that they are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Lower airfares can be good for travelers as they make trips more affordable but not necessarily for airlines. JetBlue’s unit costs excluding fuel were 18% higher in the second quarter than in 2019. While the airline expects the metric to stabilize, and maybe decline slightly, it — and no one in the industry — anticipates a return to 2019 cost levels. For one, labor expenses have shot up at every airline during the past year or so. Unit revenues will be something to watch at JetBlue, especially as it reorients its schedule away from former northeast alliance flying.New York Is a Revenue OpportunityNew York, despite JetBlue’s plans to reduce flying, remains a big opportunity for the airline. As on the West Coast, the recovery in travel demand in the Big Apple — particularly corporate demand — has lagged elsewhere in the country. For JetBlue, this means there is significant revenue recovery yet to go in New York with Hayes expecting the market to eventually return to pre-pandemic margins that exceed the airline’s system average. “Our large footprint in the slot-constrained New York market is a substantial long-term asset for JetBlue,” he said.Pratt Engine Issues May Affect JetBlueJetBlue has not yet included any impact from the recall of certain Pratt &amp; Whitney geared-turbofan engines on A320neo family aircraft in its financial outlook, Chief Financial Officer Ursula Hurley said. However, a “handful” of engines on its A321neo fleet are affected by the recall and do need to be inspected by the middle of September, she added. JetBlue currently anticipates having around four aircraft parked this fall as a result of the engine issues.And The OutlookJetBlue expects revenue to fall 4-8% year-over-year in the third quarter, largely due to the end of the American alliance and difficult comparisons to 2022. That is expected to push the airline to a loss with earnings per share forecast at negative $0.20 to flat. Capacity will be up 5.5-8.5% compared to 2022.“We lost the [NEA] case. And as such, we’re moving on,” Hayes said with the airline’s focus now squarely on securing approval of its proposed merger with Spirit Airlines.This story is from Skift's Airline Weekly.

Excluding special items, the profit was 45 cents per share, a penny better than analysts expected, according to a FactSet survey.Revenue rose 7% to $2.61 billion, matching analysts' forecast. JetBlue saved more than $300 million from jet fuel being cheaper than last year, but labor costs rose more than $200 million from a year ago.But JetBlue cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 5 cents and 40 cents per share, down from an earlier prediction of up to $1 per share. The airline said third-quarter results would range from break-even to a loss of 20 cents per share.The airline blamed up to 25 cents per share of the full-year revision to its decision to end an alliance with American Airlines in which the airlines coordinated schedules in New York and Boston and shared revenue when selling seats on each other's flights. They are now taking that deal apart after a federal judge ruled that the arrangement violates antitrust law.JetBlue said disruptions caused by bad weather and limits on air traffic control contributed to another cut of up to 25 cents per share in the 2023 forecast.

Carriers have been relying on strong demand to offset higher costs.On an earnings call, JetBlue said its revenue was facing a difficult year-on-year comparison. The company said while passenger volumes remain ""very strong"", fares are moving back towards their pre-pandemic levels.Like leisure carrier Alaska Air, JetBlue said soaring demand for long-haul international trips has led to a drop in domestic travel.While JetBlue expects the trend to improve in the fourth quarter, around the winter holidays, it is still estimated to hurt the company's full-year earnings.JetBlue now expects full-year adjusted profit of 5 cents to 40 cents per share, compared with its previous forecast of 70 cents to $1 per share. It warned of an adjusted loss of as much as 20 cents a share in the third quarter.The company also forecast a hit from the unwinding of its three-year-old alliance with American Airlines, which allowed the two carriers to coordinate flights and pool revenue.Profit for the second quarter came in at 45 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 44 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data.JetBlue said it is looking to redeploy capacity to high-margin leisure destinations. It has already made some adjustments to its capacity in Boston and plans to cut some flights out of New York.Separately, the company is facing issues with RTX's Pratt &amp; Whitney engines that power Airbus' popular A320neo jets. JetBlue said it has a handful of engines that will have to come off-wing by mid-September.As a result, it expects the number of its aircraft on the ground to double this year.

Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $52 million, compared with a loss of $75 million a year ago, reflecting the increase in adjusted revenue, partially offset by higher total net benefit and claims and other adjusted expenses.For the first six months, total adjusted revenues increased 131.0% to $268 million, Pretax adjusted earnings were a loss of $58 million, compared with a loss of $117 million a year ago.DIVIDEND AND CAPITAL RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERSThe board of directors declared the third quarter dividend of $0.42 per share, payable on September 1, 2023 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 23, 2023.In the second quarter, Aflac Incorporated deployed $700 million in capital to repurchase 10.5 million of its common shares. At the end of June 2023, the company had 95.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.OUTLOOK Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: ""Aflac delivered very strong earnings for both the quarter and the first six months. We remain actively focused on numerous initiatives in the U.S. and Japan around new products and distribution strategies to set the stage for future growth.""Looking at our operations in Japan, I am pleased that our sales results reflect improvements through agencies and strategic alliances, including Daido Life and Dai-ichi Life. I am also encouraged by the early sales results of Japan Post Company and Japan Post Insurance, which began selling our new cancer insurance product in April. We look to gain new customers through products like WAYS and Child Endowment to increase opportunities to sell our third sector products, as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our new medical product in mid-September.""In the U.S., I remain encouraged by the continued improvement in the productivity of our agents and brokers as well as contribution from our growth initiatives, including group life and disability; network dental and vision; and consumer markets. We continue to work toward reinforcing our leading position and accelerating our momentum as we enter the second half of the year.""As always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. We continue to generate strong investment results while remaining in a defensive position as we monitor evolving economic conditions. We remain committed to extending our track record of dividend growth, supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. At the same time, we remain in the market repurchasing shares with a tactical approach, focused on the growth investments we have made in our platform to improve our strength and leadership position.""All relevant prior-year amounts have been adjusted for the adoption of accounting guidance on January 1, 2023 related to accounting for long-duration insurance contracts.*See Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures section for an explanation of foreign exchange and its impact on the financial statements and definitions of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release, as well as a reconciliation of such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.ABOUT AFLAC INCORPORATEDAflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL), a Fortune 500 company, has helped provide financial protection and peace of mind for more than 67 years to millions of policyholders and customers through its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Japan.

The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).The company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release as follows:Adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management's control. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company's insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company's insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management's control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.Adjusted return on equity is adjusted earnings divided by average shareholders' equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Management uses adjusted return on equity to evaluate the financial performance of the Company's insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of this financial measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company's insurance business. The Company considers adjusted return on equity important as it excludes components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity is return on average equity (ROE) as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders' equity.Adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders' equity, excluding AOCI. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is ROE as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders' equity.Amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.Adjusted book value is the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders' equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses. Adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share is adjusted book value plus unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses, and its related per share financial measure, important as they exclude certain components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control; however, it includes the impact of foreign currency as a result of the significance of Aflac's Japan operation. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses and adjusted book value including unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.Adjusted net investment income is net investment income adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, and ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are reclassified from net investment gains and losses to net investment income. The Company considers adjusted net investment income important because it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and income associated with the Company's investments and related hedging strategies. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment income is net investment income.Adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management's control, while excluding the components that are within management's control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses. RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS(UNAUDITED – IN

This compares to FFO of $0.98 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.96 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.98, delivering a surprise of 2.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates just once.Agree Realty , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $129.9 million for the quarter ended June 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.57%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $104.88 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Agree Realty shares have lost about 8.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 19.5%.What's Next for Agree Realty?While Agree Realty has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agree Realty: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.99 on $135.7 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $3.95 on $533.49 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 2.This real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.62 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.8%.

466,684b7453-a418-3673-8083-01b261bd0598,FRT,2023-08-02,Is a Beat in Store for Federal Realty (FRT) in Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beat-store-federal-realty-frt-145700939.html,1690901820,STORY,"['FRT', 'CBRE']","[Federal Realty Investment Trust FRT, a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on retail properties, is set to report its second-quarter earnings for 2023 on Aug 2 after market close. In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this retail REIT reported a surprise of 1.27% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected healthy leasing activity and occupancy levels at its properties.Over the last four quarters, Federal Realty surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average beat being 3.79%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS SurpriseFederal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS SurpriseFederal Realty Investment Trust price-eps-surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteIn this article, we will dive deep into the U.S. retail real estate market environment and the company's fundamentals and analyze the factors that may have contributed to its second-quarter 2023 performance.US Retail Real Estate Market in Q2Per a report from CBRE Group CBRE, in the U.S. retail real estate market, rent growth recommenced in the second quarter of 2023 despite the lower demand for space.During the quarter, the net absorption of U.S. retail space amounted to 5.9 million square feet, representing the lowest level of demand since the sector experienced a negative net absorption of 10.1 million square feet in the third quarter of 2020. However, due to elevated construction costs and economic concerns, construction completions remained at historically low levels.Amid these, the overall availability rate declined by 10 basis points (bps) in the second quarter to a record low of 4.8%. Additionally, the average asking rent experienced a year-over-year increase of 2.1%, reaching $23.21 per square foot. This growth was primarily driven by significant gains in Raleigh and various Florida markets, per the CBRE Group report.Story continuesFactors to NoteFederal Realty is anticipated to have benefited from the recovery in the retail real estate market. The company has a portfolio of premium retail assets, mainly situated in major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. FRT’s properties are strategically located in the first-ring suburbs of major metropolitan markets of the United States, aiding its second-quarter cash flows.Due to strong demographics and the infill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy level over the years. FRT’s well-diversified tenant base of retailers is expected to have led to steady rental revenue generation in the second quarter. We estimate FRT’s leased rate at 94.3%, reflecting a 10-basis point increase sequentially. Moreover, Federal Realty’s solid balance-sheet position is likely to have supported its acquisition and development activities in the second quarter.FRT's strategic focus on mixed-use properties enables the company to benefit from multiple revenue streams. By combining residential, retail and office spaces, these properties attract a variety of tenants, creating a vibrant, bustling atmosphere that draws in consumers. This diversification is likely to have played a crucial role in FRT's second-quarter 2023 performance as it insulates the company from the fluctuations and uncertainties of a single sector.Projections for Q2 2023The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $277.0 million, calling for a 4.9% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for rental revenues is pegged at $276.72 million, suggesting a rise from the year-ago period’s $263.83 million.Rental income from minimum rents — commercial — is presently pegged at $179.64 million, up from $170.92 in the year-ago period. Rental income from cost reimbursements is projected at $50.71 million, up from $46.46 million in the prior-year period.Federal Realty’s activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent upward to $1.62 in the past month. However, it suggests a 1.82% decline year over year.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Federal Realty this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Federal Realty currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.31%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are two other stocks from the REIT sector — Simon Property Group SPG and Ventas VTR — that you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Simon Property Group is slated to report quarterly numbers on Aug 2.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: HSBC HSBC, Shopify SHOP, Sherwin Williams SHW and Workday WDAY.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls: Global Week AheadIn the Global Week Ahead, the Bank of England (BoE) is the last of the big central banks to meet before the summer break gets truly underway.Useful Eurozone Q2 GDP data, Friday's U.S. July nonfarm jobs numbers, and rumblings from the mainland China property sector will keep global markets busy.As the S&amp;P500's Q2-23 earnings season winds down.Next are Reuters' five world market themes, reordered for equity traders—(1) Mainland China Hopes for Stimulus from the Central GovernmentHopes for stimulus from Beijing for China's embattled property sector are well and alive, if property shares in Hong Kong and the mainland at multi-week highs are anything to go by.Removing the phrase ""houses are for living, not for speculation"" from a readout of the powerful politburo meeting fueled those hopes, but there's been a distinct lack of concrete detail.A booming property market is seen as key to igniting lackluster missing consumer spending in post-pandemic China. But Beijing will be wary. Memories of previous property sector bubbles are fresh and developers are still feeling the fallout.Sino-Ocean Group is considering a debt deferral, Dalian Wanda Commercial Management almost defaulted, and Country Garden faces mounting payment pressures in the coming months.Purchasing manager surveys in days to come are likely to offer few promising signs, after Thursday's industrial profits numbers extend the double-digit pace of declines into a sixth month.Story continues(2) Starting on Monday, Eurozone Macro Data Comes OutMarkets are impatient. The ECB just hiked rates — as expected — again and the 'will they' or 'won't they' lift rates in September debate is well underway.So even as rate-setters head for a break, data will still push around rate bets, starting with Monday's preliminary estimate of July Eurozone inflation and second quarter GDP.Overall inflation is now just half its October peak, but harder-to-break underlying price growth is hovering near historic highs and may have even accelerated again. Both measures remain above the ECB's +2.0% inflation target.Economists polled by Reuters forecast the Eurozone economy grew +0.2% in Q2. GDP was flat in Q1 versus the previous quarter.The data could strengthen the case for a September hike.""Not so fast,"" ECB doves might argue.After all, forward-looking indicators such as PMIs are pointing decidedly lower.(3) On Tuesday, HSBC Will Close Out a Mixed European Earnings Season for Big BanksHSBC on Tuesday closes out a mixed reporting season for big European banks, with investment banking revenues still dwindling as deal activity slumps, while rising rates lift more staid business lines such as corporate and retail banking.Investors are hoping for a fresh share buyback after HSBC announced a $2 billion offer last quarter and resumed paying quarterly dividends for the first time since 2019. They will also look for an increase to the bank's conservative-looking $34 billion net interest income forecast.HSBC investors have long awaited the promised land, where rising central bank interest rates lift margins from lending against its vast deposit base, but the picture is clouded in Britain by political pressure to pay stressed savers more.And China's precarious economic recovery could in turn revive fears about HSBC's nearly $10 billion exposure to the overextended commercial real state sector.(4) On Wednesday, August 2nd, the Bank of England (BoE) Sets Monetary PolicyWhen the Bank of England meets on Aug 2nd, policymakers will finally have something to cheer about. Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.But the BoE has been routinely accused of being behind the curve. It's taken policymakers eight months to bring inflation down to 7.9%, from a peak of 11.1%. It took the ECB half that time to achieve the same rate of decline.Money markets show traders think the odds are split on a 25-bp or a 50-bp hike.Investors are all too aware of how much more work the BoE has to do. After all, they're holding the most valuable bullish bet on sterling since 2014.Meanwhile, markets will also work through the fallout from the Bank of Japan's move on Friday to make its yield curve control policy more flexible and water down its commitment to defend a cap on long-term interest rates.(5) On Friday, We Get July U.S. Federal Non-farm Payroll DataThe Fed appears to have gone into data-dependent mode after hiking rates 25 bps on Wednesday to 5.25-5.50% — a level last seen just before the 2007 housing crash.Between now and its next meeting in September, the Fed gets two sets of jobs data — and inflation numbers — to pore over.First up is July non-farm payrolls on Aug. 4th.Resilient jobs growth has been a key factor in shaping investors' benign outlook on the U.S. economy, a view that — along with ebbing inflation — has helped drive rallies in stocks and other risk assets this year.Signs of an overly robust labor market could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep tightening monetary policy to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. to have added +184K jobs in non-farm payrolls in July, which would be the lowest since the pandemic recovery started.Mega-caps Apple and Amazon, meanwhile, are expected to report earnings on Aug. 3rd.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) StocksLet's look to large market-cap stocks, ones recovering from the COVID share bubble.(1) Shopify: This is an Internet Services industry player.

If you want to see the top 5 sectors popular among smart investors, head directly to 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Long-Term. The S&amp;P 500 had a robust performance in the first half of 2023, ending June with a gain of over 6%. Overall, the index has risen almost 16% as it enters the third quarter of this year. In addition to that, as we previously reported, the NASDAQ 100 Index has skyrocketed 40% in 2023, regardless of fears about a potential bubble. In 2023, technology stocks, growth stocks, and cryptocurrencies emerged as star performers, benefiting from renewed interest in risk assets. As we enter the second half of 2023, there are signs of inflation starting to cool off. Nonetheless, market experts are skeptical that the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation are not yet complete, and there is still a possibility of the US falling into recession.In 2023, Fidelity Investments expects some consumer staples firms to outperform. Ben Shuleva, Fidelity’s sector portfolio manager, commented at the end of December 2022: “In 2023, many of the trends that emerged in 2022 will probably continue. However, consumers may be more sensitive to further price hikes than they were to previous price hikes—particularly if the economy softens further and the unemployment rate rises. Those best positioned for this backdrop may include companies that can raise prices further without losing sales volumes.”Don't Miss: Top 30 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index WeightSimilarly, precious metals like gold are considered to be safe haven assets against a backdrop riddled with inflation, devaluation of currency, and macroeconomic weakness. Eric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining UCITS ETF, told CNBC in December 2022: “Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022. It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.”Story continuesIn addition to that, Citibank analysts maintained an ""Overweight"" rating for the healthcare sector for 2023, setting aside concerns about the past year's strong performance. They emphasized the sector's defensive nature and held particular optimism about pharmaceuticals.Also Read: How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyAccording to NASDAQ’s “June, Mid-Year 2023 Review and Outlook” report, in the first half of 2023, 7 out of 11 sectors recorded gains, with Technology, Communications, and Discretionary sectors being market leaders. Technology stocks neared their previous all-time high from December 2021. While technology and growth sectors contributed significantly to the strong performance in the early months of this year, there was a noticeable shift towards cyclicals in June, possibly indicating an improvement in economic activity. All sectors ended June with positive returns. Industrials stood out with strong performance in June and continued momentum in early July, reaching new all-time highs. Housing also rebounded despite higher mortgage rates, driven by factors such as favorable demographics and migration patterns. These trends suggest positive prospects for the real estate sector as well. Some of the top stocks in the market include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).

Consumer DefensiveNumber of Companies: 3The Morningstar US Consumer Defensive Index had a slight decline of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2023, in contrast to the broader market's 5.4% gain. However, most stocks in the index still seem fairly valued, trading at a slight discount to their fair value estimates, as per Morningstar. Opportunities exist in consumer-packaged goods and alcoholic beverages, where many companies are undervalued. Consumer Defensive is one of the best sectors to invest in for the long-term. American retail giant Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is a prominent consumer defensive stock among hedge funds. On July 30, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announced that it has invested $1.4 billion to increase its ownership in the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart by acquiring hedge fund Tiger Global's stake. This move follows Walmart's initial purchase of a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018. According to Insider Monkey’s Q1 data, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was part of 91 hedge fund portfolios, up from 66 in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“The pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”7. Basic MaterialsNumber of Companies: 4Basic Materials is one of the best sectors to invest in long-term. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global construction materials market was worth $1,272.60 billion in 2022. It is expected to grow from $1,320.01 billion in 2023 to $1,729.62 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 3.9% during the forecast period.

(NYSE:FCX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Other top contributors during the quarter were copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) and health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare. With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”6. EnergyNumber of Companies: 6Energy sector remains one of the best sectors to invest in for the long-term. As per a report by The Business Research Company, the global oil and gas market increased from $6,989.65 billion in 2022 to $7,330.80 billion in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate of 4.9%.

Oil and gas have been the best game in the stock market town this year and it was a pleasant surprise to see home builders pick up even with dour news on interest rates and the economy.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 81% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week’s 7.4% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 6.7%.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Union Pacific, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Union Pacific?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Union Pacific. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Union Pacific's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Union Pacific. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.5% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.1% and 4.1% of the stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Union PacificWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Union Pacific Corporation in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$275m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 19% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

If you want to see the top 5 sectors popular among smart investors, head directly to 5 Best Sectors To Invest In Long-Term. The S&amp;P 500 had a robust performance in the first half of 2023, ending June with a gain of over 6%. Overall, the index has risen almost 16% as it enters the third quarter of this year. In addition to that, as we previously reported, the NASDAQ 100 Index has skyrocketed 40% in 2023, regardless of fears about a potential bubble. In 2023, technology stocks, growth stocks, and cryptocurrencies emerged as star performers, benefiting from renewed interest in risk assets. As we enter the second half of 2023, there are signs of inflation starting to cool off. Nonetheless, market experts are skeptical that the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat inflation are not yet complete, and there is still a possibility of the US falling into recession.In 2023, Fidelity Investments expects some consumer staples firms to outperform. Ben Shuleva, Fidelity’s sector portfolio manager, commented at the end of December 2022: “In 2023, many of the trends that emerged in 2022 will probably continue. However, consumers may be more sensitive to further price hikes than they were to previous price hikes—particularly if the economy softens further and the unemployment rate rises. Those best positioned for this backdrop may include companies that can raise prices further without losing sales volumes.”Don't Miss: Top 30 S&amp;P 500 Stocks by Index WeightSimilarly, precious metals like gold are considered to be safe haven assets against a backdrop riddled with inflation, devaluation of currency, and macroeconomic weakness. Eric Strand, manager of the AuAg ESG Gold Mining UCITS ETF, told CNBC in December 2022: “Central banks as a group have continued, since the great financial crisis, to add more and more gold to their reserves, with a new record set for [the third quarter of] 2022. It is our opinion that central banks will pivot on their rate hikes and become dovish during 2023, which will ignite an explosive move for gold for years to come. We therefore believe gold will end 2023 at least 20% higher, and we also see miners outperforming gold with a factor of two.”Story continuesIn addition to that, Citibank analysts maintained an ""Overweight"" rating for the healthcare sector for 2023, setting aside concerns about the past year's strong performance. They emphasized the sector's defensive nature and held particular optimism about pharmaceuticals.Also Read: How to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyAccording to NASDAQ’s “June, Mid-Year 2023 Review and Outlook” report, in the first half of 2023, 7 out of 11 sectors recorded gains, with Technology, Communications, and Discretionary sectors being market leaders. Technology stocks neared their previous all-time high from December 2021. While technology and growth sectors contributed significantly to the strong performance in the early months of this year, there was a noticeable shift towards cyclicals in June, possibly indicating an improvement in economic activity. All sectors ended June with positive returns. Industrials stood out with strong performance in June and continued momentum in early July, reaching new all-time highs. Housing also rebounded despite higher mortgage rates, driven by factors such as favorable demographics and migration patterns. These trends suggest positive prospects for the real estate sector as well. Some of the top stocks in the market include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH).

It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.”7.

With little fundamental news to report, Freeport-McMoRan’s share price advance in Q4 reflected a rebound in copper prices, driven by the recognition that copper inventories are low relative to historical norms. We believe the company continues to have meaningful price and volume leverage in a copper constrained world.”6. EnergyNumber of Companies: 6Energy sector remains one of the best sectors to invest in for the long-term.

The brand originated from Rebecca Hessel Cohen’s desire to design the perfect bridesmaid dress for her own ethereal summer wedding at her family home in Bridgehampton. From an initial collection of hand-dyed silk dresses, LoveShackFancy quickly gained a dedicated following for its romantic pieces that whisper of dream escapes and special moments. Sellout collaborations include Hurley, Bogner, American Girl and Bandier. The brand is stocked at notable wholesale accounts such as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Harrods and Selfridges, plus select online retailers Net-A-Porter and Revolve.
