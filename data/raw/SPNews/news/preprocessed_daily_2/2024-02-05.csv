If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on budgeting for healthcare, you may go to 5 Countries with the Most Affordable Healthcare for US Retirees. ', 'If you\'re a 65-year-old today, the National Council on Aging expects you to live for another 20 years. The downside? You may also fall amongst the 95% of older adults with at least one chronic condition, such as a heart disease or even Alzheimer\'s, throughout this life span. With the US reaching Peak 65 this year, the situation can be rather alarming considering a large majority of these adults underestimate the healthcare costs in their retirement period, and that too, at ""dangerously low"" levels. In this regard, the Protected Retirement Income and Planning Study has found a whopping 84% of working Americans who don\'t think health is going to be a primary factor of their retirement when the time comes. Unfortunately, the results from Alliance for Lifetime Income and Cannex Financial Exchanges Ltd. report the situation to be otherwise. According to them, 38% of retired Americans ages 45 to 75 have reported health as the primary reason for retirement. Bottom line: healthcare can cost you tens of thousands of dollars in your golden years.', ""To quote a figure, the Employee Benefit Research Institute has estimated that an individual needs as much as $383,000 in savings to have a 90% chance of covering all of their healthcare expenses in retirement. This includes out-of-pocket costs, premiums, deductibles, and also prescriptions. According to the T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) Price Retirement Savings and Spending Study (RSS) survey, lump sum costs, however, aren't useful for planning and budgeting healthcare costs in retirement. This is because these expenses aren't incurred as lump sums anyway. Since premiums are predictable and the most variation in healthcare costs is driven by out-of-pocket costs, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW), in turn, argues that healthcare costs are, in fact, very predictable for the average retiree. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) suggests four strategies that potential retirees can adapt to save the most for this significant expense of the retirement phase. First, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) suggests individuals make the most of their Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Earnings in these accounts grow tax-free, and even withdrawals and earnings are tax and penalty-free."", 'Next, potential retirees must also know that missing the Initial Enrollment Period for Medicare results in a permanent penalty. Should you neglect to enroll in Medicare Part B during your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP), the period covering routine outpatient medical expenses, you may face a 10% increase in your monthly Part B premiums for each 12-month interval without coverage. Other strategies like planning for long-term care, such as long-term care insurance, can also minimize risk in an individual’s financial situation, notes The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW).', ""Meanwhile, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) recommends breaking down these healthcare costs into three factors to help better plan them. These three factors are annual costs, types of health insurance coverage, and separation of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Personalizing these expenses can better help an individual to plan and prepare for them. Regardless, healthcare costs tend to be expensive for many retirees. For this reason, many individuals are now opting to move to countries with the most affordable healthcare. Our list will help you explore the best options you've got."", 'GagliardiImages/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of countries with the most affordable healthcare for US retirees, we have used our previous list of countries with the most affordable and efficient healthcare, as well as sources such as Nasdaq, International Living, and CNBC. Next, we ranked them on factors such as their affordability in comparison to the US, the average healthcare costs, and the quality of healthcare infrastructure. Individual scores have been summed up to get an Insider Monkey Score. Places have been ranked in an ascending order from the lowest scores to the highest.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Here is the list of countries with the most affordable healthcare for US retirees:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 12', 'Ranking 15th on our list of countries with the most affordable healthcare is Italy. The country’s public healthcare system is called the National Health Service (NHS), or the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN). While the cost of Italy’s health insurance system is low, US retirees must be legal foreign residents to avail the same treatment as Italian citizens, having stayed for more than three months in the country. Commencing this year, international residents including pensioners with elective residence visas are required to pay a minimum of $2,161 annually under the budget law 2024, in order to access the national health service. This translates to roughly $180 per month.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 15', 'Costa Rica is one of the cheapest places to retire to in the world. The country boasts top-tier healthcare in Latin America, evident in its impressive life expectancy of 80 years. The United Nations ranks its public health system amongst the top 20 public systems in the world. US expats are eligible for their free public health services provided that they make monthly contributions to the public health system. This contribution can be anywhere between 7-11% of their monthly income to the Caja, Costa Rica’s social security fund. Expats in the country have 30 CAJA hospitals and 250 clinics to choose from.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 17 ', 'Colombia has an excellent healthcare system that comes at an affordable cost. As of 2023, the nation’s healthcare secured 35th position out of 191 countries, surpassing one point ahead of the United States in the global ranking. The country has globally-accredited medical centers, public hospitals, as well as bilingual doctors across the country. A US retiree with a legal residency status can enroll themselves in Entidades Promotoras de Salud (EPS), its public healthcare system, to avail health services. The average premium per month for a couple in Colombia, as reported by expats, is around $80.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 19 ', 'Mexico ranks 12th on our list of countries with the most affordable healthcare for US retirees, and expats can expect to pay 50% less for the same treatments and procedures than their own country. As such, a US expat retiree who is a legal resident in the country can apply for either the IMSS system (Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social), part of the social security program, or the Instituto del Salud para el Bienestar, also known as the INSABI program. The latter is designed for those having pre-existing conditions or those who aren’t able to participate in IMSS because of lack of affordability. Premiums for the IMSS depend on age and are a monthly average of $75.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 24', 'Many expats choose to retire to Panama, drawn not only by its beauty but also by its reputation as one of the best places to retire overseas for affordable and efficient healthcare. Expats can access both the public and private health systems in the country. The public healthcare system is almost free. However, they are recommended to buy private insurance which is not only affordable but also offers access to modern facilities, English-speaking professionals, and shorter wait times. \xa0The two largest private insurers in the country are MAPFRE and Family Medical, with coverage costs averaging $85 per month.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 26', 'Brazil is another country offering the best healthcare for expats and that too, at about 20% less than what a retiree would pay in the US. The country has one of the largest healthcare markets in Latin America. Its healthcare system in Brazil is called the Sistema Unico de Saude (SUS) and provides free and universal healthcare to citizens and residents. Expats, however, often choose the private healthcare system to avoid longer wait times and avail high-end facilities.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 27', 'Ecuador already hails as one of our top countries to retire on social security in 2024, and its addition to our list of countries with the most affordable healthcare solidifies its standing as an exceptional destination. An expat retiree can expect to pay 10 to 25% less than what they would in the US. Moreover, general practitioner visits cost $25 on average, specialist runs cost $60 on average, while an hour session with a psychiatrist can cost $45 an hour (on average).', 'Insider Monkey Score: 28', ""Another country offering one of the best healthcare systems in the world is Spain. Over 5 million expats live in this country and benefit from its highly efficient healthcare system. The universal public healthcare system offers free healthcare to citizens, but expats can avail it's private options as well. The average price of private insurance for expats ranges between $100 to $200 per month. Retired expats can also avail a public health care scheme known as 'Convenio Especial.’ Expats can expect to pay around $65 if they are under 65 or $157 if they are above 65."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 29', ""According to William Russel, France ranks amongst the countries with free healthcare for foreigners. A retiree can avail access to this country's healthcare system after living in the country for at least three months, provided it is their place of residence for six months of the year. Nasdaq claims that an individual needs to apply for a long-stay visa for the first 12 months, and then file for permanent residency to live here and avail of the health services. Moreover, expats can also avail private facilities as well, often receiving reimbursement for a significant portion of their expenses incurred at slightly more expensive private clinics and hospitals."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 30', 'Malaysia may be known for its rich culture and diverse nature, but its healthcare system is also a strong factor determining it as a good option for retirement. Its universal healthcare system exists alongside private healthcare options. A basic private health insurance plan costs around $65 per month.

If you want to skip our overview of financial markets, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy Now. ', ""The U.S. finance industry is a global behemoth unparalleled by any other nation. American banks, such as the Wall Street behemoth JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), investment holding companies like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), hedge funds such as Ken Fisher and Ken Griffin's Fisher Asset Management and Citadel Investment, and asset managers like Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) are behemoths in their respective industries."", 'Each of these firms and their industries play a specific role in the financial sector. Hedge funds typically seek to use client capital and leverage to engage in complex strategies that have led to their owners becoming some of the richest people in the world (you can read (16 Richest Hedge Fund Managers in the World to find out whose sits at the top of the billionaire pyramid). Banks, as we all know, move money all over the world and work with the Federal Reserve to ensure that financial market participants have enough money to finance their business operations and investments.', 'Similarly, asset managers also rely on client money to grow its value over time and take a cut from the profits. This business is so lucrative, that some of the biggest asset management stocks in the world such as Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) are corporate behemoths worth hundreds of billions of dollar in market value. This far outstrips hedge funds, and despite the fact that few hedge funds are publicly traded entities, the difference between hedge funds and asset managers is not well understood.', ""Therefore, before we delve deeper into the best asset management stocks, it's important to understand how the two are similar and different. After all, Insider Monkey's research has shown that hedge fund stock picks tend to outperform stock markets significantly, yet the total assets under management of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates are lower than Apollo Global's cash and investment assets. Therein lies the difference between hedge funds and asset managers, as the former's high tolerance for risk often sees their services limited to those with the biggest risk appetite or the most money."", 'Since asset management stocks are publicly traded, their operations are also far more transparent than those of a hedge fund. This is because every asset management stock is required to file its quarterly and annual reports, along with reports of other material changes with the S.E.C. 413', ""Yet, just like every other stock, asset management stocks are also subject to tailwinds and headwinds. After all, if one can't directly invest with an asset manager, the next best thing might be to buy its stock to gain some exposure to professional players' understanding of the economy. Intuitively speaking, asset managers tend to do well when markets are also performing well. They invest in a myriad of sectors such as the stock market, the currency markets, the bond markets, and commodities. The performance of these markets, and by extension asset management stocks, depends on several factors such as interest rates, economic growth, political conflict, and global supply chain disruptions. For instance, the latest U.S. strikes in Syria were reported in the press soon after 4 p.m. Eastern time, or just in time for market close, and Central Command's press release followed after 4:30 p.m."", ""The start of February is proving to be a great couple of days for asset management penny stocks. As of February 2, 2024, asset management stocks such as Royalty Management Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:RMCO), Puyi Inc. (NASDAQ:PUYI), and The Marygold Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGLD) are posting high single digit share price gains. Other established firms, such as the ones that we've mentioned above are displaying a mixed bag of performance. While Blackstone and Blackrock are down year to date, Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO)'s shares are up close to 13% year to date."", 'This shows that asset management stocks are able to stand on their own despite turmoil in other financial sectors. The start of 2024 is seeing the U.S. regional banking sector start to tremble once again after New York Community Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE:NYCB) absorbed hundreds of millions of dollars as a contingency against office real estate loans and surprise investors during the fourth quarter of 2023.', ""With this important context about asset management stocks, let's take a look at the best asset management stocks.

The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", 'A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:', '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$7.33b', 'US$8.39b', 'US$9.12b', 'US$10.9b', 'US$11.9b', 'US$12.8b', 'US$13.6b', 'US$14.2b', 'US$14.8b', 'US$15.3b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x5', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 9.60%', 'Est @ 7.39%', 'Est @ 5.84%', 'Est @ 4.75%', 'Est @ 3.99%', 'Est @ 3.46%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% ', 'US$6.8k', 'US$7.3k', 'US$7.4k', 'US$8.2k', 'US$8.4k', 'US$8.4k', 'US$8.3k', 'US$8.1k', 'US$7.9k', 'US$7.6k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$79b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

If Biden secures a second term, investors should see stocks in sectors such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, healthcare, technology, cannabis and others. Biden’s focus on climate change, healthcare expansion and infrastructure signals promising long-term growth for companies aligned with these themes.

(Even if Amazon doesn’t now, it will likely surpass Walmart in overall sales sometime over the next year.)"", 'And yet, there is one key area of Amazon’s retail business where it is still chasing Walmart from far behind: grocery sales. And yes, key Amazon executives care very much about growing their business in this sector now, just like they have for many, many years.', ""First, let’s be clear: There's a lot that Walmart, in turn, admires in Amazon. Walmart surely wishes it had something close to Amazon’s giant AWS cloud computing business, which topped $90 billion in 2023 revenue and is one of the tech giant’s most profitable segments. AWS is also a major reason why investors value Amazon like a tech stock and not a retail stock."", 'Walmart is also chasing Amazon from way behind in online advertising – another highly profitable segment and a main contributor to Amazon’s soaring market cap. Amazon’s ad business grew 27% in the fourth quarter and topped $46 billion in 2023 revenue. While Walmart is making progress in this space, its ad business is still a small fraction of Amazon’s.', 'Then, of course, there’s Amazon’s third-party seller services business – basically, all of the fees it charges small and mid-sized merchants to list their wares on Amazon sites, pack and ship their orders to customer doors, and handle customer inquiries afterward if something goes wrong. That business topped $90 billion in 2023 as the share of total Amazon goods sold by these sellers crossed the 60% mark for the first time in the company’s history. Walmart has been building its own similar offerings in this area too and many Amazon sellers have welcomed the retailer’s efforts as they search for any possible outlet to diversify their online sales and lessen their reliance on Amazon.', 'But groceries have been Amazon’s Achilles heel for some time. All the way back in 2005, Amazon’s current consumer CEO Doug Herrington pitched Jeff Bezos on what would eventually become the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service. Herrington’s appeal centered on his belief that the company could never build a truly massive Everything Store if it didn’t sell the items that customers buy most frequently: perishable groceries and consumer-packaged goods.', '“Selling a book or a TV is great and super helpful,” Herrington told me in an interview for my recent book Winner Sells All, about the Amazon/Walmart rivalry. “[But] how many times do I buy a book or TV each week versus how many times do I buy a packaged goods item, or some toilet paper or some food?”', 'Frequency of purchase breeds customer loyalty. And customer loyalty breeds high lifetime value for a corporation. Selling groceries at good prices also can make a retail business more recession-proof. When the economy sags, people cut back on nice-to-haves and prioritize spending on what they must have. Walmart understood this and expanded into groceries decades ago. Now it accounts for nearly 30% of all U.S. grocery sales, including revenue from its subsidiary Sam’s Club.', 'But one of the main challenges for Amazon, which accounts for just 3% of U.S. grocery sales, in selling groceries and other CPG products online is that they typically have thin profit margins. Add shipping or delivery costs to the equation, and it’s almost impossible to generate a profit unless it’s a very large order. The key to Amazon’s online retail domination has been Amazon Prime, but Prime breeds fewer items per order because of its simplicity of free shipping with no minimum spend requirement. In groceries and packaged goods categories though, retailers want customers to order many items at a time. It’s one defect of Prime.', 'So Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017 for nearly $14 billion to try to make a dent. The results at the chain of approximately 500 stores have been mostly uninspiring to date. Amazon also started building its own grocery store chain – Amazon Fresh – targeting a more mainstream customer. The company, under CEO Andy Jassy, paused this expansion and is now remodeling a few of its 40-plus stores before deciding on the best way to proceed.', '“The results so far are very promising,” Jassy said on a call with analysts on Thursday.', 'Last year, Amazon also closed at least eight of its more than 30 Amazon Go locations, small-format convenience stores outfitted with an expensive cocktail of cameras, sensors, and computer vision that let customers just walk out after grabbing goods off of a shelf and automatically be charged for the items later.', 'A former UK grocery executive, Tony Hoggett, now leads all of Amazon’s grocery initiatives, so the experience at the top is there. Amazon’s physical store sales, the majority of which come from Whole Foods, grew 4% year over year to $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'And finally, Amazon believes the continued buildout of its same-day and overnight delivery will make the sale of low-priced packaged foods more affordable. Making money on a single six-pack of Coke or bottle of shampoo or Clorox if you have to ship it a long distance is nearly impossible. But if it’s stored in a warehouse close to a dense population of customers, the calculus might change. Unsurprisingly then, both Jassy and the company’s chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, talked up this fact in remarks to both reporters and analysts this week.', 'For now, though, it continues to be perhaps the only remaining area where Amazon truly trails Walmart – and in a big way.', 'Do you have thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

It's not just computers and smartphones that are now connected to the internet. Everyday items like light fixtures, televisions, large household appliances, vehicles, and even doorbells are becoming part of the online network. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, stands out as potentially the most significant technological breakthrough in our lifetimes. According to a PwC report, a mere year after the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT, 54% of surveyed companies had already integrated generative AI into various aspects of their business operations. Established companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are at the forefront, launching AI products and services that have a far-reaching influence on billions of users worldwide."", ""For years, both consumers and enterprises have been leveraging artificial intelligence in various ways: interacting with voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, automating repetitive tasks, and employing algorithms to identify patterns and correlations in data. However, it was the emergence of applications capable of generating original text and digital art that truly marked a significant milestone—a new era where AI demonstrates its ability to mimic human creative processes and quickly becomes widely recognized. Of course, AI has long been a fast-moving field, but these past few years have led the industry through lightning-fast developments. In November 2022, ChatGPT was launched, and just four months later, OpenAI introduced a new and significantly enhanced large language model (LLM) named GPT-4. Additionally, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, made remarkable progress by May 2023, now capable of processing 100,000 tokens of text in a minute, equivalent to about 75,000 words—an average novel’s length. This was a substantial improvement from its initial capacity of roughly 9,000 tokens when it debuted in March 2023. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has made several advancements with generative AI, including the introduction of a new Large Language Model (LLM) called PaLM 2 in May of last year, which serves to power the Bard chatbot, as well as other Google products, showcasing the company's commitment to pushing the boundaries of generative AI technology."", 'See also: 10 Best AI Stocks for 2024', 'Generative AI use in the enterprise will expand beyond just individuals, teams, and departments: There will be AI assistants in corporate boardrooms across the globe, helping companies navigate dynamic markets, increase profits, and gain an advantage over their competitors.

These AI assistants will take into account a company’s industry, its competitors, business goals, historical industry data, etc., to provide executives with the most precise insights possible. As such, the influence of generative AI on productivity has the potential to contribute trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. According to McKinsey’s research estimates, the technology could bring about an annual addition of approximately $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion. In addition, the firm believes that approximately 75% of the value derived from generative AI use cases is concentrated in four key areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D.', 'Presently, a handful of major players dominate the AI assistant landscape, each offering distinct features.

As it pertains to investments, much of the hype around AI surrounds the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- a catchy moniker for the biggest names in tech: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla.', 'While each of these stocks has generated market-beating returns over the last year, savvy investors understand that there are a host of other emerging leaders in AI.', 'Although International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) may not be growing at a commensurate level relative to other names in enterprise tech, the company has made some interesting investments over the last couple of years that appear to be paying off.', ""Let's dig into IBM's role in the AI landscape and assess if now is a good time to scoop up shares in this blue chip stock."", ""Some of IBM's core AI tools live with its Watson computer system. Watson is a sophisticated platform that utilizes natural language processing and machine-learning models to answer questions. Although this is an impressive feature, Watson's latest AI development is what piqued my interest."", 'Applications for AI are unfolding at an unprecedented pace. Even lawmakers are grappling with the complexities and risks associated with the technology, and how to best regulate it. Just a few months ago, IBM released watsonx.governance -- a tool for AI compliance protocols.', ""While it's still nascent, major corporations such as accounting and consulting firm Deloitte have deployed the governance software in its risk management practice. Additional use cases for Watson's governance capabilities include financial services such as bill approval, as well as ethical hiring practices."", 'Admittedly, IBM is a bit different from other enterprise technology businesses. The company was late to the game in cloud computing, lagging innovative solutions from Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. However, its $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in 2019 has helped it turn things around a bit.', 'What really sets IBM apart from the competition, however, is its consulting practice. ""We continue to believe our consulting business will be an early beneficiary of AI,"" CEO Arvind Krishna stated during the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We are the only provider today that offers both a technology stack with our watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI.""', 'Generally speaking, software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses primarily focus on selling subscriptions. Recurring software licenses generate steady, predictable revenue that tends to carry a high margin. By contrast, consulting services are typically non-recurring and come with much lower margin profiles compared to software. Therefore, many enterprise tech companies may shy away from a heavy focus on professional services.', ""But during the fourth quarter, one-third of the company's bookings related to generative AI came from software. The other two-thirds came from deals signed through the consulting arm. IBM's unique business model is actually turning the consulting operation into a channel for more software revenue, specifically in AI."", ""The chart above depicts IBM's revenue, gross profit, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last decade. It's easy to see that the company's financial trends have experienced some dramatic peaks and valleys over the last few years."", ""What's a little surprising, however, is the company's valuation. As of the time of this article, IBM stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.5 -- well above the company's 10-year average of 14.7."", ""If you're looking to invest outside of the bigger names in AI, IBM could represent a solid long-term opportunity. However, while the company has some very interesting prospects in AI, it needs to prove that it can compete among other major players. In 2023, IBM's total revenue only grew by 2%, and the company guided for growth in the mid-single-digit percentages for this year."", ""With the stock soaring since IBM reported fourth-quarter earnings last week, I think it could be a little overbought. I see the company as well-positioned to benefit from rising demand in AI and think it's quietly becoming an influential player in the space. But with its valuation hovering around its highest level in a decade, my concern is that AI hype is priced into IBM at the moment."", 'Nevertheless, as the company continues to reinvent itself and make inroads in the ever-evolving landscape of generative AI, IBM certainly looks intriguing and could be worth keeping an eye on.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.', 'Last Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft and Alphabet, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon, Apple and Meta Platforms.', 'All these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now.', 'Microsoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.', 'Alphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.', ""Amazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating."", 'Apple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.', 'Meta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.', 'The chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.', 'AAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.', 'It is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them.', 'I think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.', 'The success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.', 'Meta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.', 'Alphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business, does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubt it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.', 'Apple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.', 'Nonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive.

With 831 locations at the start of this year, Dutch Bros is still much smaller than the current industry leader, Starbucks, which has over 16,000 U.S. stores."", ""However, there's another company that managed to quickly dethrone Starbucks in a major market, and Dutch Bros might already be following the same playbook. As it continues along this trajectory, Dutch Bros could grow enough to eventually rival Starbucks as well -- investors should pay attention."", ""Dutch Bros currently operates in 16 U.S. states, mostly on or near the West Coast. It's developed a growing base of loyal customers by cultivating a fun and friendly culture with a focus on speed and customer service."", 'To that end, it has drive-thrus in many of its locations with its ""broistas"" coming through the lines to take orders. It also has a robust membership program to build its brand and community.', ""It doesn't differ from Starbucks in fundamental ways, but as a smaller, faster-growing company that's still somewhat regional, it's taking the time to determine what drives its customers and how it can harness that information to generate and meet demand."", 'Investors may remember industry upstart Luckin Coffee from the massive hype it enjoyed a few years ago. Shares of the China-based coffee chain soared before an an accounting scandal in 2020 eventually saw the company file for bankruptcy and become delisted from the Nasdaq.', ""But the business hasn't gone anywhere. In fact, it's moved way past those struggles to overtake Starbucks as the top coffee shop in China by sales and store count. It has about 13,300 locations, almost all of which are in China, versus 6,975 Starbucks stores in that region."", ""Founded in 2017, Luckin has grown sharply by establishing quick delivery services and a strong mobile app. Its menu offers interesting flavors to resonate with its market, all while being cheaper than Starbucks too. Since its focus is on rapid service and delivery, it's been able to open up new stores faster than Starbucks, which previously focused on larger, eat-in-style stores. Under the leadership of a new CEO, Starbucks has changed its strategy too, not just in China but worldwide, to provide faster service and to enhance its digital offerings."", 'Dutch Bros might not be opening thousands of locations per year like Luckin Coffee did, but it has ambitions to reach at least 4,000 stores while expanding to new states. It had targeted 150 store openings annually, but it surpassed that in 2023 and plans to open up to 165 new shops this year.', 'The company has demonstrated that it understands its target market, providing innovative beverages and an atmosphere that brings them back for more. Like Luckin, its drinks are slightly cheaper than comparable Starbucks beverages. Its expansion will have a focus on drive-thru and convenience with many locations boasting multiple drive-thru lanes and walk-up windows.', 'Dutch Bros recently named a new CEO, who is growing the management team with industry veterans to take the company to the next level.', ""Investors might consider Dutch Bros a bit risky. It's relatively small and has only recently started to report positive net income. But it's posting strong growth with revenue up 33% year over year in Q3 2023, and it has a huge market opportunity in the U.S. alone."", ""If you have an appetite for risk, now is a great time to buy Dutch Bros stock. It's down 30% over the past year and trades at a price-to-sales ratio of only 1.7. If you're not ready to take the plunge, at least keep this growth stock on your watch list."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Dutch Bros wasn't one of them.

Revenues were US$4.8b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$5.23, an impressive 21% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Parker-Hannifin ', ""Following last week's earnings report, Parker-Hannifin's 18 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$19.9b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per-share earnings are expected to be US$20.68, roughly flat on the last 12 months. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$19.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$19.32 in 2024. The analysts seems to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates."", ""The consensus price target rose 9.3% to US$532, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Parker-Hannifin analyst has a price target of US$627 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$300. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Parker-Hannifin's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 0.7% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 7.2% over the past five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 3.2% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Parker-Hannifin is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants."", 'The most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Parker-Hannifin following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.', ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on Parker-Hannifin. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to PPG Industries'  ROE today."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for PPG Industries ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for PPG Industries is:', '16% = US$1.3b ÷ US$7.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""At first glance, PPG Industries seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 15%. However, we are curious as to how PPG Industries' decent returns still resulted in flat growth for PPG Industries in the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that PPG Industries' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 13% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for PPG? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. "", ""Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 45% (meaning the company retains55% of profits) in the last three-year period, PPG Industries' earnings growth was more or les flat. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""Moreover, PPG Industries has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in PPG Industries' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 26%, over the same period."", ""Overall, we feel that PPG Industries certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Graseck, however, has been talking to management teams from the banking giants, and believes that the rules will not be as restrictive as had been previously assumed.', '“We’re anticipating that a final rule set will better align with global standards, driving a lower risk-weighted assets uplift than banks originally disclosed,” Graseck said, and she went on to point out that larger banks will see larger benefits, as they have more excess capital to set to work, once the lighter rules are in place. She expects to see a significant increase in buybacks as the banks start using that excess capital.', 'Zooming in, Graseck takes the time to give several major bank stocks a closer look in light of this development. She sees reason to upgrade several, believing the ‘future is bright’ for particular names in the space. So, let’s take a closer look at two of her recent upgrades and with help from the TipRanks database, we can also gauge general Street sentiment toward these stocks.', 'Bank of America (BAC)', 'We’ll start with Bank of America, one of the world’s largest banking firms. BofA boasts a market cap of $265 billion, and has approximately $3.18 trillion in total assets on the books. The bank is one of the top four in the US (alongside JPM, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup) and is ranked second by total domestic bank deposits. Bank of America has more than 3,900 retail banking locations, and some 16,000 ATMs.', 'The company released its 4Q23 and full-year 2023 results on January 12. The top line revenue figure for the quarter came to $22 billion, for a 10.5% year-over-year slip and missing expectations by $1.77 billion. For the year, revenue came to $98.6 billion, compared to $95 billion in 2022. At the bottom line, BoA reported an adjusted quarterly EPS of 70 cents per share, beating the forecast by 6 cents.', 'Of particular interest, in light of analyst Graseck’s comments above on the banking sector generally, BofA has a long-held commitment to capital return. During the fourth quarter, the bank paid out $1.9 billion in dividends, and spent $800 million on share repurchases. The last dividend payment was declared on January 31, at 24 cents per share. The annualized payment of 96 cents gives a yield of 2.87%.', 'For Graseck, the important point on BAC is the relatively discounted price of the stock. She writes, “We are upgrading BAC primarily on valuation, as the stock is trading at only 9x our 2025 EPS, near the low end of its 8-15x average range over the last decade. We do not think a stock that can deliver 10% or more ROE should trade at an 11% cost of equity. Bank of America also benefits from a strong consumer deposit franchise, with 92% of consumer checking accounts being primary accounts and 67% of deposit balances being with customers that have been at BAC for more than 10 years.”', 'Looking ahead, the Morgan Stanley analyst sees plenty of potential for Bank of America to hold the line in its business, and notes the bank’s sound liquidity potential: “In our view, we see extraordinarily low risk BAC would have to tap unrealized losses in its HTM securities book given the strength, stickiness and diversity of its growing deposit franchise, ability to increase deposit rates to grow deposit balances if desired, extensive global liquidity sources of $897B, and daily LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) testing as a GSIB (global systemically important banks).”', 'All of that makes a sound foundation for this bank, and supports Graseck’s upgrade from Equal-weight (i.e., Neutral) to Overweight (Buy). Her price target on the shares, bumped up from $32 to $41, implies a one-year potential upside of 22.5%. (To watch Graseck’s track record, click here)', 'The 19 recent analyst reviews on BAC break down to 11 Buys, 7 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating on the shares. The stock is trading for $33.47 and its $37.36 average target price points toward a 12-month gain of 11.5%. (See BAC stock forecast)', 'Goldman Sachs (GS)', 'Next on our list is one of the best-known names in investment banking and financial services, Goldman Sachs. GS caters to a customer base made up of banks, corporations, financial institutions, governments and government agencies, and high-net-worth individuals, offering a full range of banking and credit services, including wealth and asset management and investment banking. Goldman is based in New York City, maintains offices in many of the world’s iconic financial centers, and has been in operation for over 150 years.', 'With its lower Manhattan address and its well-heeled clientele, Goldman definitely occupies a high-prestige niche in the banking world. The bank’s experts are well-known on Wall Street, and their views on the economy, the stock market, and the international financial scene are frequently in demand, making Goldman a leader in global investment research. GS has built up a market cap north of $126 billion, and as of December 31 last year had $1.642 trillion in total assets.', 'Goldman isn’t shy about returning capital to its investors. The bank reported its last set of financial results, for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, on January 16, and those results showed that, in 2023, the firm returned $9.39 billion worth of capital to common shareholders. This return included $5.8 billion in common stock repurchases, along with $3.59 billion in common share dividend payments. The most recent dividend, of $2.75, was declared for a March 28 payment. The dividend has an annualized rate of $11, and a forward yield of 2.84%.', 'That total capital return was based on the company’s strong performance. Quarterly revenue came to $11.32 billion, up almost 7% y/y and some $360 million over the forecast. The bottom-line earnings, reported as $5.48 per share, were $1.55 per share better than had been anticipated.', 'Analyst Graseck notes that Goldman’s current position makes it particularly suited to gain on a capital rebound, and writes at length to explain why, saying, “Goldman is the most exposed in our Large Cap Banks coverage to a capital markets rebound, with 64% of revenues coming from Global Banking & Markets in 2024 in our model. We model Goldman’s M&A advisory revenues increasing by 45% in 2024, ECM increasing 59% and DCM increasing 42%, a large percentage inflection off of a low base… We estimate $14B excess CET1 (1.9% of CET1 ratio) in scenario where Basel Endgame aligns with Europe, setting stage for a sharp uplift in net share buybacks from 1% of shares in 4Q23 ann. run rate to 7% of shares in ’26.”', 'Looking ahead, Graseck uses these comments to back up her Equal-weight (Neutral) to Overweight (Buy) upgrade on GS shares. Her price target is now set at $449 (up from $333), implying a 16% upside on the one-year horizon.', 'Overall, Goldman gets a Moderate Buy from the Street’s consensus, based on 21 recent reviews that include 14 Buys to 7 Holds. Shares are trading for $387.86 and their $425.05 average price target suggests an increase of 9.5% in the next 12 months.

This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes.

If you want to skip our overview of financial markets, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy Now. ', ""The U.S. finance industry is a global behemoth unparalleled by any other nation. American banks, such as the Wall Street behemoth JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), investment holding companies like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), hedge funds such as Ken Fisher and Ken Griffin's Fisher Asset Management and Citadel Investment, and asset managers like Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) are behemoths in their respective industries."", 'Each of these firms and their industries play a specific role in the financial sector. Hedge funds typically seek to use client capital and leverage to engage in complex strategies that have led to their owners becoming some of the richest people in the world (you can read (16 Richest Hedge Fund Managers in the World to find out whose sits at the top of the billionaire pyramid). Banks, as we all know, move money all over the world and work with the Federal Reserve to ensure that financial market participants have enough money to finance their business operations and investments.', 'Similarly, asset managers also rely on client money to grow its value over time and take a cut from the profits. This business is so lucrative, that some of the biggest asset management stocks in the world such as Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) are corporate behemoths worth hundreds of billions of dollar in market value. This far outstrips hedge funds, and despite the fact that few hedge funds are publicly traded entities, the difference between hedge funds and asset managers is not well understood.', ""Therefore, before we delve deeper into the best asset management stocks, it's important to understand how the two are similar and different. After all, Insider Monkey's research has shown that hedge fund stock picks tend to outperform stock markets significantly, yet the total assets under management of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates are lower than Apollo Global's cash and investment assets. Therein lies the difference between hedge funds and asset managers, as the former's high tolerance for risk often sees their services limited to those with the biggest risk appetite or the most money."", 'Since asset management stocks are publicly traded, their operations are also far more transparent than those of a hedge fund. This is because every asset management stock is required to file its quarterly and annual reports, along with reports of other material changes with the S.E.C. 413', ""Yet, just like every other stock, asset management stocks are also subject to tailwinds and headwinds. After all, if one can't directly invest with an asset manager, the next best thing might be to buy its stock to gain some exposure to professional players' understanding of the economy. Intuitively speaking, asset managers tend to do well when markets are also performing well. They invest in a myriad of sectors such as the stock market, the currency markets, the bond markets, and commodities. The performance of these markets, and by extension asset management stocks, depends on several factors such as interest rates, economic growth, political conflict, and global supply chain disruptions. For instance, the latest U.S. strikes in Syria were reported in the press soon after 4 p.m. Eastern time, or just in time for market close, and Central Command's press release followed after 4:30 p.m."", ""The start of February is proving to be a great couple of days for asset management penny stocks. As of February 2, 2024, asset management stocks such as Royalty Management Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:RMCO), Puyi Inc. (NASDAQ:PUYI), and The Marygold Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGLD) are posting high single digit share price gains. Other established firms, such as the ones that we've mentioned above are displaying a mixed bag of performance. While Blackstone and Blackrock are down year to date, Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO)'s shares are up close to 13% year to date."", 'This shows that asset management stocks are able to stand on their own despite turmoil in other financial sectors.

Some analysts expect that nuclear energy will play a crucial part in the world’s transition away from thermal coal burning. It is extremely efficient in converting raw materials into power. Relying on solar, wind, hydroelectric, and other forms may not be enough to satisfy the world’s energy needs.

Now renters and the poor are falling behind,Associated Press Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americans-saddled-themselves-credit-card-181847623.html,1706897927,STORY,"['AXP', 'SYF']","['NEW YORK (AP) — While the U.S. economy is broadly healthy, pockets of Americans have run through their savings and run up their credit card balances after battling inflation for more than two years.', 'Experts worry that members of these groups -- mostly lower- and middle-income Americans, who tend to be renters -- are falling behind on their debts and could face further deterioration of their financial health in the year ahead, particularly those who have recently resumed paying off student loans.', '“The U.S. economy is currently performing better than most forecasters expected a year ago, thanks in large part to a resilient consumer,"" wrote Shernette McLoud, an economist with TD Economics, in a report issued Wednesday. ""However, more recently that spending is increasingly being financed by credit cards.”', 'Americans held more than $1.05 trillion on their credit cards in the third quarter of 2023, a record, and a figure certain to grow once the fourth-quarter data is released by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. next month. A recent report from the credit rating company Moody’s showed that credit card delinquency rates and charge-off rates, or the percent of loans that a bank believes will never be repaid, are now well above their 2019 levels and are expected to keep climbing.', 'These worrisome metrics coincide with the average interest rate on a bank credit card of roughly 21.5%, the highest it’s been since the Federal Reserve started tracking the data in 1994.', ""“Overall, the consumer is credit healthy. However, the reality is that there are starting to be some significant signs of stress,” said Silvio Tavares, president and CEO of VantageScore, one of the country's two major credit scoring systems."", 'Most analyses of Americans’ financial health tend to tell a tale of two consumers. On one side are the roughly two-thirds of Americans who own their homes and those who’ve invested in the stock market and done substantially well. They generally had the savings cushion necessary to weather high inflation. Delinquency rates on single-family homes remain at near historic lows and home prices have continued to climb.', 'But for the rest of America, things are looking rough.', '“You have these noticeable pockets of consumers -- mostly middle- and lower-income renters who have not benefitted from the wealth effect of higher housing prices and stock prices -- who are feeling financial stress and that’s driving up these delinquency levels. They’ve been hit very hard by inflation,” said Warren Kornfeld, a senior vice president at Moody’s, in an interview.', 'Kornfeld, who co-wrote a report last week looking at the climbing levels of delinquencies, expects them to keep climbing this year.', 'Consumers’ financial health could play a big role in the 2024 election. President Joe Biden is running in part on his efforts to bring down costs for U.S. families. Republicans counter that Biden is to blame for higher costs in the first place.', 'One way to gauge this bifurcation of the American economy is by looking at the results of some major credit card companies. The customers of Capital One, Discover Financial and Synchrony have historically been those with lower credit scores, while American Express typically serves the wealthiest and well-to-do.', 'At Synchrony Bank, the largest issuer of retail co-brand credit cards, the charge-off rate jumped from 3.5% to 5.6% in a year. Meanwhile, roughly 4.7% of Synchrony customers are 30 days or more behind on their bills, which is also up from a year ago.', 'Discover’s customers are carrying $102 billion in balances on their credit cards, up 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the charge-off rates and 30-day delinquency rates have climbed. Executives say they can see the impact of inflation.', '“Think about a consumer that makes $50,000 a year,” said John Green, Discover’s chief financial officer, at an investor conference in December. “When inflation outpaces your wage growth, they’re making choices in terms of what they’re going to spend, what bill they’re going to pay and what they’re going to frankly put on their table.”', 'Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 and is now slightly above 3%. But the costs of many goods and services remains elevated. A loaf of bread that cost $1.54 in December 2020 cost $2.02 at the end of last year, and a gallon of gas has risen from an average of $2.17 to $3.29 in the same timeframe, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.', 'Renters in particular have felt the pinch. The median rent for a property with up to two bedrooms has jumped from $1,424 at the end of 2020 to $1,713 at the end of last year, according to realtor.com.', 'VantageScore’s Tavares worries that the recent reintroduction of student loan payments could more acutely impact these customers in their ability to repay their debts.', '“Folks are scrambling to pay these obligations that they haven’t had to pay in three years, and it’s hitting exactly the demographic we are talking about here: the younger folk, less affluent folk,” Tavares said.', 'American Express has also seen its charge-offs and delinquencies climb in the past year, but not as much as its competitors. Historically, AmEx has catered to customers with higher credit scores who pay off their cards at the end of each month. But even AmEx customers are now carrying a balance more regularly. AmEx’s net charge-off rate last quarter was 2%, up from 1.2% a year earlier.', 'In the middle of the spectrum are JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, two gigantic banks with large portfolios of customers. Their credit metrics have ticked up only modestly, likely because the banks’ clients run the gamut of income levels and credit scores. But both banks have been setting more money aside to cover potential loan losses, mostly due to their credit card portfolios.', 'It’s unlikely that Americans will see any relief from the banks or interest rates any time soon that would allow them to refinance these high interest debts. The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that its first interest rate cut is likely months away. Further, credit card interest rates tend to be extremely high compared to what the Fed charges for loans.', 'Further, reports on bank industry sentiment show that banks are being more conservative in giving out loans, which means it will be less likely that these Americans will be able to refinance their high credit card bills into lower interest loans.', 'Economists at the moment feel the financial strain felt by these lower income Americans is not likely to spill over broadly into the broader economy, at least at the moment. But economists and experts see these rising delinquencies as one of the growing risks to the economy this year, especially if student loans become too much for younger, debt-burdened Americans to handle.', '“Rising delinquencies, while they do require monitoring, are not quite sounding alarm bells,” TD Economics’ McLeod wrote in their report.']"
68,88772551-8882-45f3-a9f2-a844a7ec8939,MA,2024-02-05,Another sneaky Biden energy move,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/another-sneaky-biden-energy-move-182802772.html,1706725682,STORY,['NG=F'],"['President Biden has done more to promote green energy than any other president in US history. It’s ironic that he remains remarkably bound to fossil fuels, in ways he probably hopes nobody notices.', 'Biden’s entire energy agenda during the last three years has paired the overt promotion of renewables with a covert effort to keep fossil fuels plentiful and cheap. The latest example is the Biden administration’s Jan. 26 decision to temporarily suspend the approval of new facilities for exporting natural gas. Current facilities will continue to operate, without any limit on exports.', 'The pause will let the Energy Department study the impact of surging US natural gas exports on the climate, domestic energy prices, national security concerns, and other factors. The review will take several months, followed by the usual comment period. You won’t go broke betting the farm that an outcome will come in 2025, well after the November elections.', 'In one regard, a review makes sense. The fracking revolution that kicked off around 2010 generated a massive boom in US fossil fuel production, which has made the United States the world’s biggest oil and gas producer. US law limited energy exports until President Barack Obama signed legislation and changed other rules broadly allowing oil and gas exports. Starting in 2015, gas exports soared. The Biden administration now says the rules for approving export facilities are outdated and need to account for the nearly fivefold rise in gas exports since 2014.', 'But there’s also a likely political angle when a president makes a controversial policy change in an election year. Environmental groups lobbied hard for the pause on new gas-export facilities, and they declared victory when the White House made the decision. So maybe Biden is reinvigorating his pitch to environmentally minded voters, who skew young and want to see more forceful action to banish the source of greenhouse gases causing global warming.', 'Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.', 'There could also be another target: keeping American energy prices low. Drillers often say that robust exports create an incentive to produce more gas, which in turn keeps domestic supplies abundant and prices low. But that may be wishful thinking. A 2023 analysis by the US Energy Information Administration found that “higher [gas] exports results in upward pressure on US natural gas prices and lower [gas] exports results in downward pressure.” It’s also true that gas prices in other markets, such as Europe and Asia, are considerably higher than in the United States, which creates an obvious incentive for American producers to sell outside the country where they can make more money.', ""So Biden might be making sure there’s no uptick in US energy prices while he’s running for reelection. Natural gas prices get far less attention than gasoline prices, but they’re arguably more important because natural gas powers 40% of the nation’s electricity generation and 60% of home heating. “It seems likely,” Kurt Cobb wrote recently on OilPrice.com, “that someone whispered into the administration's ear something about the possibility of much higher domestic prices in the coming years if the US LNG [liquified natural gas] export juggernaut is allowed to continue.”"", 'US natural gas prices did spike in 2022, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a sharp reduction of Russian gas exports to Europe and a scramble by other gas exporters to fill the gap. US natural gas prices are now back to the relatively low levels typical from 2015 to 2021.', 'Electricity costs have jumped, however, and stayed there. Since Biden took office, electricity costs have risen 27%. That’s a stealthy source of inflation, which has been Biden’s biggest economic problem. Higher electricity prices boost consumers’ utility bills, while also making it more expensive for businesses to produce goods and keep the lights on (literally). Businesses normally try to pass cost increases on to consumers.', ""When inflation spiked in 2022 and gasoline prices hit $5 per gallon, Biden's approval rating dropped sharply. Overall inflation is almost back to normal levels, but Biden clearly recognizes the risk that high energy prices pose to his political future. Since 2022, Biden has taken a variety of measures to lower energy prices: selling oil from the US reserve, asking Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, and even encouraging more energy production by ne'er-do-well nations Iran and Venezuela. Biden's credibility with environmentalists comes from the massive green energy plan he signed into law in 2022, but Biden's overall popularity relies far more on the cost of fossil fuels we're still dependent on."", ""There's good reason for Biden to retain the pro-export policy that began under Obama, continued under President Trump, and remained in place for Biden’s first three years in office. In a Jan. 26 analysis, the Eurasia Group argued that ongoing high levels of American gas exports are an important lifeline to Europe and a key lever of US power in other parts of the world, including Asia. Russia would clearly love more influence in those parts of the world, and the availability of American energy as an alternative to Russia's exports is a barrier to Russia's malign ambitions."", 'So maybe the Biden review will sound the all-clear, with a few permit denials to appease the climate lobby, if Biden wins reelection. But if evidence mounts that energy exports are raising costs for Americans, Biden won’t be the last president to have a problem with that.', 'Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

(Yes, ""Star Wars"" would\'ve been a catchier name, but Ronald Reagan already claimed it.) For $515 million, Rocket Lab will build 18 ""transport layer"" satellites by 2027, then run them for the government through 2030 or 2033.', 'Abracadabra, presto-change-o, all of a sudden Rocket Lab had been anointed a ""prime"" defense contractor for the U.S. Space Force.', ""This did wonders for Rocket Lab stock, of course, igniting a buying frenzy that drove shares up 30% in the space of one week. And yet the enthusiasm didn't last. Over the course of January, we've already seen Rocket Lab stock fall back 10%."", 'So where did all the excitement go?', ""In part, you can blame the Pentagon for investors' sudden disappointment in Rocket Lab. You can also blame giant defense companies Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT)\xa0and L3Harris (NYSE: LHX), and also private space company Sierra Space. In January, you see, Space Force revealed that Rocket Lab wasn't the only company winning new contracts under the PWSA program -- and it definitely wasn't the company winning the most lucrative contracts."", 'Bing, bang, boom, in a trio of contract awards, Space Force doled out three more 18-satellite contracts to these other space companies, each of which was told to build the exact same number of satellites as Rocket Lab will build -- but for much more money. Sierra Space will be paid $740 million for 18 satellites, while publicly traded Lockheed Martin and L3Harris will be paid even more: $890 million and $919 million, respectively.', 'You see the problem: Rocket Lab appears to have jumped at the chance to do the same work its peers will be doing, yet will be paid as little as 56% as much for the work.', 'As a shareholder in Rocket Lab myself, I have to admit that this feels a little unfair. And yet it does make some sense. Rocket Lab is, after all, best known for building rockets, not satellites. It makes sense that the Pentagon might have more confidence in more established satellite-builders to build its satellites, and therefore be willing to pay more for their work, at least initially.', ""In the case of Lockheed Martin, for example, several of its PWSA satellites are already in orbit and presumably performing as specified. This may be why Space Force has awarded Lockheed contracts to build a total of 106 satellites, or 24% of the 438 contracts awarded so far. It's also worth pointing out that the $2.6 billion that Lockheed has been awarded under this program works out to a price of only $24.5 million per satellite -- which is actually less money, per satellite, than the $28.6 million price Rocket Lab will be paid."", 'Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), the biggest recipient of PWSA contracts to date, will earn even less than that -- $21.5 million per satellite across the 130 units it was asked to build.', ""The fact is, if you want to feel sorry for anyone, feel sorry for privately held York Space Systems. According to a report by CNBC, York has won the second-most contracts of all -- 126 -- but will be paid barely $10 million per satellite that it builds! Granted, it's still curious that L3Harris (NYSE: LHX) will receive $1.8 billion to build only 36 satellites. That's more than three times Rocket Lab's fee, for only twice as many satellites."", ""But by and large, it does make sense that more established companies that build satellites in bulk would win more contracts, and win more valuable contracts as their earlier satellites prove their worth. It's also possible that once Rocket Lab's first batch of satellites is in orbit and operating, the company will be able to negotiate bigger and more lucrative follow-on contracts as old PWSA satellites age out and need to be replaced."", ""In the meantime, Rocket Lab investors can take comfort in one thing: Even if other companies are getting more and better PWSA contracts than Rocket Lab, this is still Rocket Lab's biggest contract ever won. It amounts to more than two full years' worth of the company's annual revenue, and should boost profit margins for the space upstart, because this revenue will fall within Rocket Lab's higher-profit-margin space systems business, which according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence earns 19% annual gross profit margins -- twice what Rocket Lab gets from launching rockets."", ""It's not as big a win as we might hope for. But it's still a win, and we'll take it."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Rocket Lab USA right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Rocket Lab USA, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Rocket Lab USA wasn't one of them.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Best States for First-Time Homebuyers.', '2023 was a demotivating year for many homebuyers including those who wanted to purchase their first ever house. As soaring home prices raised affordability concerns for these first-time homebuyers, they postponed their decision to buy a house. Simultaneously, existing homeowners held on to their houses since they were to pay a higher interest on a new house. Mortgage rates remained high and reluctant. The existing inventory of houses was also not enough to cater to the rising consumer demand. However, the gloomy housing market is experiencing a positive change in 2024.', 'On February 1, Forbes reported that although house affordability problems are persistent, the drop in mortgage rates will enable numerous home shoppers to own a house in 2024. The majority of experts expect that the hike in the interest rates against inflation will finally be at rest. The market’s return to normal also depends on certain factors. These factors include how well will the inventory be restored since this can bring the home prices down. Cities where home prices are falling have been previously covered. Another condition is a rather steady drop in interest rates. This is because a sharp decrease can highly increase demand which will ruin the gains in inventory.', 'The current housing stock is still behind what is required. However, a positive development in this regard is that builders have begun to see improved conditions for future construction. During the month of January, the builder sentiment increased from 37 to 44. New single-family building permits have also experienced a rise. ', 'On January 25, The New York Times reported that the inventory of existing houses has been even less. This has driven new construction of homes to fulfill the demand. The construction and purchase of new houses went up in the second half of 2023. As of now, new homes account for 30% of the overall housing market. This new home market is relatively bright and offers options, especially to those who wish to buy for the first time. Another issue pertaining to newly constructed houses is that they tend to be more expensive than existing houses. In order to address this problem and cater to the needs of buyers who are budget-conscious, homebuilders are shrinking room sizes and altering floor plans.', 'The US housing market is still subject to the issues it has faced throughout 2023. It will take quite some time for the market to go back to the pre-pandemic levels of inventory as well as mortgage rates. While the housing market cools down, companies such as Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM), and KB Home (NYSE:KBH) offer reasonable living options in desirable locations. Let’s take a look at what these home construction companies have been up to.

Lennar's Multifamily segment also develops high-quality multifamily rental properties.

Amenities in this single-family home master-planned community include a fitness center, playground, a clubhouse, and pickleball courts. Pricing for the new homes starts in the mid $400,000s. The community offers a short commute to Tampa and St. Petersburg. Anna Maria Island and beaches in Florida can also be visited by the residents.

The total revenue for the quarter amounted to $4.29 billion. An increase of 57% was recorded in net new orders. The homebuilder witnessed a substantial rise in buyer activity.', 'KB Home (NYSE: KBH) is another major home construction company in the US. Homebuyers can choose from multiple design options to get their houses personalized based on their preference and budget. On January 26, KB Home (NYSE: KBH) reported the grand opening of three new communities namely Lexington, Fairfax, and Hayworth in Elk Grove, California. Parks, playgrounds, sports courts, and an elementary school are some of the included amenities. While staying in these communities, homebuyers can easily travel to major employment centers in Sacramento and Sacramento International Airport. Elk Grove Aquatics Center, Emerald Lakes Golf Course, and Elk Grove Regional Park can also be conveniently accessed. Pricing for homes in the three communities starts from the mid $500,000s, low $600,000s, and mid $600,000s, respectively.', 'There are several other best homebuilder stocks to invest in.

The dip iwas attributed to the meager net income that year, resulting from a one-time provision made in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at that time. In 2017, Johnson & Johnson was required to record a $10.1 billion charge related to previously undistributed earnings in foreign jurisdictions and a net $3.4 billion deferred tax liability and withholding taxes.

However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 25% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""The past week has proven to be lucrative for Merck investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's three-year performance."", ' See our latest analysis for Merck ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', 'Over the last three years, Merck failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 57% (annualized).', 'Thus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Merck's TSR for the last 3 years was 94%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""It's nice to see that Merck shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over the last year.

Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

Despite myriad difficulties, including missing delivery targets on the 737 and continuing to lose money in its defense business, the stock is only down 2.5% over the last year. Also, it is up 41% since management outlined its medium-term plans on its investor day in November."", 'So, what should investors think about the stock?', 'Returning to the targets given in 2022, management said it aimed for $10 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the 2025/2026 time frame. To get there, the plan is to get all three segments generating significant operating cash flows by then, with Boeing commercial airplanes (BCA) generating $9 billion; Boeing defense, space & security (BDS) $3 billion; and Boeing global services (BGS) $2 billion.', ""At this point, it's worth noting Boeing's market cap is only $128 billion, so $10 billion in FCF would put it on 12.8 times FCF in 2025 or, at the latest, 2026, according to the plan. Those are attractive valuations, and it's understandable if investors see Boeing as a great value play. After all, it has a multiyear backlog in place, and its only major competitor, Airbus, also has issues ramping production to meet demand."", 'As part of the bridge to get there, management had forecast $3 billion to $5 billion in FCF in 2023. In addition, the plan involves hitting a production rate on the 737 of 50 a month, and getting BDS back to high-single-digit profit margins while working through problematic fixed-price development programs and, hopefully, avoiding costly charges on them.', ""Unfortunately, Boeing's scorecard on the way to achieving these aims is not good, and the fourth-quarter earnings help typify its issues."", 'This infographic shows many of the issues at stake. As you can see, Boeing is growing revenue at a double-digit rate. Still, its margin remains weak: Just $283 million in operating profit on $22 billion worth of sales means an operating profit margin of just 1.3%.', ""In addition, Boeing hasn't avoided multibillion-dollar charges on its defense business, and BDS's operating margin was -1.5% in the quarter and -7.1% for the year."", ""BCA delivered 396 Boeing 737 planes in 2023, well below its target of 400-450, and its profit margin was just 0.4% in the quarter. Given these levels of profitability, it's no surprise that Boeing's FCF of $3.1 billion for the full year just snuck into the guidance range of $3 billion to $5 billion I mentioned earlier."", 'In light of the fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun fell short of changing the 2025/2026 targets and instead elected to do what some thought he might do earlier -- in other words, push out expectations for the targets to be hit: ""We\'re still confident in the goals we laid out for \'25, \'26, although it may take longer in that window than initially anticipated, and we won\'t rush the system.', ""Boeing's targets offer a large window of opportunity to hit, but the company is undeniably behind track. The latest quality control issue on the 737 raises questions over the company's processes, and management's failure to issue 2024 guidance on the recent earnings call is a sign of the uncertainty around its commercial airplane deliveries this year."", 'Meanwhile, Boeing is definitely not the only company struggling to generate margin expansion in the defense industry. For example, RTX missed its defense business guidance for the last two years and recently took down its medium-term defense business outlook, while Lockheed Martin continues struggling with margins.', 'These issues speak to an industry-wide problem of soaring costs as defense contractors execute fixed-price programs they overly competitively bid for.', 'It all suggests more challenges for Boeing, yet the stock remains a good value proposition. Cautious investors will wait until management issues some form of guidance for 2024, and there are plenty of other ways to invest in the sector. As such, it makes sense to wait and see what Calhoun has in mind for 2024 and how viable the ""bridge"" to 2025/2026 is before buying in.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Boeing right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Boeing, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Boeing wasn't one of them.

While interest rate cuts aren't expected anytime soon, the end of rising rates is still a sigh of relief for an industry reliant on a humming economy to generate profits."", ""An end to interest rate hikes should also solve a key problem of late for banks, Wells Fargo included. Across the industry, there has been a steady increase in loan charge-offs, a metric measuring the percentage of loans a bank believes it will be unable to collect. In the last quarter of 2022, Wells Fargo's net charge-off ratio was just 0.23%, hovering just above historical lows. That figure, however, has increased every quarter since, finishing 2023 at 0.53%. To be sure, current levels aren't much to worry about, but the steady rise, mostly caused by borrowers facing higher interest rates, should level off now that the Federal Reserve has stepped back."", ""Investors are also gaining confidence that banks will be better positioned to handle a potential economic downturn. Basel III, a stricter set of rules governing international banking regulations, is expected to arrive as early as 2025, and most banks have been preparing in advance. Wells Fargo's Tier 1 capital ratio, for example, which compares a bank's capital to its assets, has risen from 10.6% in 2022 to 11.4% today.

At the peak of the surge, shares reached price-to-book multiples as high as 1.10, though things have now settled to around 1.05."", 'Considering price-to-book multiples are one of the best ways to gauge the attractiveness of a bank stock, is Wells Fargo suddenly too expensive? That depends on your time horizon.', ""Over the short term, anything can happen. As you can see from the chart above, Wells Fargo's valuation is constantly gyrating, and a return to pre-surge levels is certainly possible. But if you're a long-term shareholder, there's reason to believe shares still offer a compelling opportunity for profit."", 'For years, Wells Fargo stock has been under artificial pressure due to a 2016 scandal in which it created millions of accounts without customer authorization to boost performance figures. The federal government fined the bank $3 billion for its actions while also instituting an asset cap, limiting how large the bank could grow. Wells Fargo also agreed to an overhaul plan with a third-party review, though this has taken several years to implement.', ""Bank executives now believe the restrictions could be lifted as early as the first quarter of 2025.

You can skip our detailed analysis of methods of obtaining second passport as well as a look at the US MNCs in the European market and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens. ', 'In this ever-expanding world of opportunities, the idea of second passports has been hailed as a harbinger of many benefits, both economic and social. Whether it is a desire to live and experience the gems and natural wonders of this world, incentives for a higher quality of life, or even financial diversification, there is something for everyone here. About half a century ago, the concept of a second passport or dual citizenship was unfathomable and highly disliked by almost all countries. However, with time and advancement, the significance of a free flow of residents between countries has been acknowledged, and a more tolerant view has emerged as a consequence. Thus, we can now find various easy countries for a second passport for U.S. citizens.', 'As is the case with almost everything, there are both advantages and disadvantages to acquiring and maintaining a second passport. However, with the increasing trend towards dual citizenship, it appears that the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects. The perks include, but are not limited to, access to global travel, better social and economic benefits, more business and job opportunities, and certain tax reliefs. For a detailed analysis of dual citizenship advantages and disadvantages, check out our article on Dual Citizenship: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements. Thus, the appeal of obtaining a second passport can be understood, and the search for the easiest countries to achieve this, is justified.', ""The growing demand for a second passport has prompted many people, especially the rich, to relocate to various countries around the globe. According to a recent estimate from the State Department, approximately 9 million Americans are living abroad. It is observed that 40% of US residents abroad choose to move to the Western Hemisphere, which includes Canada, Central, and South America. Additionally, 26% move to Europe, 14% to East Asia and the Pacific, and another 14% to the Middle East. Many prominent US entrepreneurs have made headlines with news of their foreign citizenship. Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has acquired Indonesia’s Golden Visa. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), chose Cyprus’s Golden Visa, and billionaire Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), obtained New Zealand’s citizenship in 2011. Therefore, it is evident that there are countries where US residents can gain a second passport with ease."", 'To acquire a second passport, there are primarily four paths to follow: citizenship through birth/descent, citizenship through marriage, citizenship through investment, and citizenship through a residency-by-investment program or naturalization. Citizenship through birth/descent is attained by being born to parents with citizenship, automatically granting the same for the child. Proof of an ancestral connection with a citizen can also lead to citizenship. Citizenship through investment is mainly acquired by making an economic investment in the country. Naturalization is a process through which citizenship can be achieved by gaining residency in a country, often through investment, and building a relationship with the country by spending a specified time there. Alternatively, citizenship can be granted by marrying a citizen of a country. Thus, depending on the method employed, there are many countries where US residents can access a second passport.', ""European markets stand among the largest global economies. With an increasing influx of emigrants to these states, it's no surprise that more companies are expanding their operations there. Thirty percent of US companies move to Europe to achieve their profit goals, and thirty-two percent even introduce new products to tap into this burgeoning market."", 'Ireland’s economy, in particular, has experienced a staggering positive impact from multinationals in 2022. These companies contributed 56% to the total value added, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG). Notably, sectors such as information and communication, dominated by MNCs like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: META), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), witnessed the most significant expansion.', 'Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is actively expanding its operations in the European market, as indicated by recent developments. In October 2023, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), secured unconditional EU anti-trust approval for its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Seagen (SGEN.O).', 'Similarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is making strategic moves to maintain a strong presence in the European market. On December 13, 2023, the company announced the expansion of its Self Service Repair program, now covering the iPhone 15 lineup and Mac models powered by M2 chips. This extension includes the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) also confirmed the availability of this Self Service Repair program in 24 additional European countries, such as Croatia, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland.', '15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens', 'To create our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, we conducted extensive research on the best and most straightforward options available. We also referred to our article from the previous year, highlighting the 15 Easiest Countries to Get Citizenship as an American. Additionally, we cross-referenced our findings with ImmigrantInvest.com’s list of countries that permit dual citizenship for US citizens. Our comprehensive approach considered various methods for obtaining dual citizenship, encompassing citizenship by descent, residency, naturalization through investment programs, and citizenship by investment programs. We made sure to include countries from diverse regions, spanning Latin America, Asia and the South Pacific, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Now that we have thoroughly combed our sources and selected the easiest countries for second passport for US citizens, we present it to you in an ascending list:', 'In the Asia and South Pacific region, numerous countries offer citizenship through various means. Considering the countries that permit dual citizenship for US residents and the fact that New Zealand falls under the category of the easiest countries to obtain citizenship through descent, we have placed this country at number 15 on our list.', 'Considered one of the most affordable and expedient methods to acquire a second passport, gaining citizenship in New Zealand is remarkably straightforward. If one of the parents is a citizen of New Zealand, the child can easily obtain citizenship by submitting an application, with the process typically taking about 30 working days. For those seeking an even faster turnaround, a reduced processing time of 10 days is available for an additional fee. New Zealand, being a developed country, ensures a high quality of life for its residents. Acquiring dual citizenship from this nation can prove to be a beneficial option for many Americans.', ""Italy, being one of the European countries, stands out as one of the easiest nations to obtain citizenship for US residents through descent. All that is required is proof of Italian descent, with a birth certificate of oneself and one's parents, grandparents, or any direct ancestor typically considered sufficient. Other acceptable documents may include death certificates, divorce or marriage certificates. However, two conditions must be met: the ancestor acquired citizenship before June 14, 1912, and this citizenship had not been renounced or replaced by a second citizenship before the birth of their child."", ""Situated in the Caribbean, this picturesque island is a favored destination for US residents. It not only provides the chance to enjoy natural marvels but also offers opportunities for financial gains through multiple tax advantages. The St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the easiest and quickest ways for US citizens to obtain a second passport. The program doesn't require any mandatory stay period in the country, and the immigration process is completed in just four months. The primary requirement is a $250,000 payment to the Sustainable Island State Contribution (SISC)."", 'Similar to St. Kitts and Nevis, another Caribbean island stands out as one of the easiest options for obtaining a second passport for US citizens. The St. Lucia investment program is particularly cost-effective, requiring a contribution of $100,000 to St. Lucia’s Government Development Fund as the minimum investment. While this figure applies for a single person, a slightly higher amount for a spouse or children allows the qualified US resident to secure dual citizenship for themselves and their family in just three months.', 'In the Pacific region, Vanuatu takes the lead by offering the only citizenship-by-investment program. Individuals, including US residents, can acquire citizenship by investing $130,000. Beyond the relatively low investment requirement, the most significant advantage lies in the expeditious process, which can be completed in approximately 2 months. Vanuatu not only offers various tax benefits, including no income tax, inheritance tax, or capital gains tax but also provides a straightforward and easy pathway for gaining a second passport for US residents.', 'Ireland is a popular destination for immigration, particularly through the Descent Program. The Irish government has made this process highly accessible, allowing individuals to qualify for citizenship rights by establishing an ancestral connection up to the great-grandfather. Additionally, other familial ties, such as marriage to an Irish citizen, provide an opportunity for citizenship, with the requirement of spending at least three years with the said spouse or partner. Although this period may seem relatively long, it is shorter compared to Portugal or Switzerland. Therefore, Ireland stands out as one of the easiest countries for obtaining a second passport for US citizens.', ""Close to the US, Canada is considered one of the easiest countries for US residents to apply for obtaining dual citizenship. Known for its welcoming environment, Canada boasts a straightforward immigration process. While US citizens don't require a visa for stays less than 180 days, a visa or residency permit is needed for longer stays."", 'While the Quebec Investor Program is an option, the easiest route is through the Express Entry System. Under this program, individuals skilled in three major economic fields in Canada are evaluated using a point system. The higher the points, the greater the likelihood of obtaining a visa. Subsequently, a stay of at least three years or 1095 days out of 5 years would lead to citizenship. Other conditions include passing tests related to Canadian history and language (English or French) as well as fulfilling any necessary tax obligations.', 'This European country is renowned as one of the easiest nations providing citizenship through a residency-by-investment program. The Golden Visa allows an individual to acquire residency rights within three months, with an investment of at least €300,000. This residency can eventually lead to citizenship in approximately seven years, provided essential government requirements are met. These include maintaining the investment and residency for seven years, adhering to the required time period for staying in the country, and visiting Cyprus at least once every two years.', 'The Caribbean Islands continue to offer some of the easiest paths for obtaining a second passport for US residents, with Antigua and Barbuda emerging as a prominent option. Notably, this stunning island stands out due to its low investment amount ($100,000) and a quick and hassle-free process. In contrast to many countries that increase the initial investment amount with the introduction of more family members, Antigua and Barbuda includes a spouse and two children in the same figure, with additional cost only on the form of fees. There are three ways to make the investment, and citizenship can be obtained in about three to four months. However, the country requires a presence of five days a year for passport renewal.', ""Grenada secures the 6th position on our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, primarily due to the speed with which citizenship can be achieved. The country's citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the best in the Caribbean Islands. With a minimum investment through a donation of $150,000 for a single person (which increases to $200,000 and additional fees for a family of four), a qualifying investor can attain citizenship within three to six months."", 'Click to continue reading and see our 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens.', 'Suggested Articles:', ' 24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024', '15 Countries With Highest Mortgage Rates', '12 Most Innovative Economies in Europe', 'Disclosure: None. 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

Higher stock prices do make it a bit tougher for bargain hunters to find deals, but stocks don't all rise or fall on a synchronized schedule. Some invariably lag behind those broad-market patterns."", ""The tough part of seeking out bargains among those laggard stocks is that there's usually a good reason why a company's shares didn't participate in the rally. Still, even when there's a good reason, at the right prices, out-of-favor stocks may well be worth buying."", ""With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors went looking for stocks the recent bull market has left behind that might have a bit of life ahead of them, despite Wall Street's pessimism. They came up with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Confluent (NASDAQ: CFLT), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI). But only you can decide whether they're cheap enough to be worth a spot in your portfolio."", 'Eric Volkman (Pfizer): With rare exceptions, star power rarely lasts forever. One example of a company that recently experienced the downside of this dynamic is pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.', 'A few years ago, Pfizer was a hot item thanks to its heavy involvement in the fight against COVID-19. It was the co-developer of the go-to coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty. On top of that, it is the company behind the well-known COVID antiviral treatment Paxlovid.', 'In the thick of the pandemic, when hundreds of millions of people were eager to get inoculated, and when treatments for the disease were in high demand, Pfizer experienced big leaps in revenue and profitability.', 'Even the mightiest company would find it challenging to follow up that sort of performance with a similar second act, and Pfizer is falling short in the minds of many. After all, both its recently released fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 headline figures were down substantially as the pandemic has evolved into an endemic and the public health crisis has receded. Revenue for Q4 and the full year fell by more than 40% on a year-over-year basis, with non-GAAP (adjusted) net income nose-diving by 91% in the quarter.', 'Yet those fourth-quarter figures beat the collective estimates from analysts, who were expecting the pharmaceutical giant to post a fairly deep adjusted net loss. Much of the upside surprise was due to Comirnaty, which is still making its way into the arms of people who are aware that COVID-19 remains a threat.', ""However, sales of several of Pfizer's top products fell, compounding the generally bearish reaction to the earnings report. For example, in the face of intensifying competition, cancer treatment Ibrance saw a nearly 13% year-over-year decline in sales. Looming patent expirations for Ibrance and other top sellers are also making investors fret."", ""They really shouldn't. Pfizer still has a solid lineup of blockbuster drugs, and it has a robust pipeline with potential blockbusters in development."", ""Meanwhile, its valuations look sickly, and will surely improve once the market gets past the idea that the company can't sufficiently recover from the decline in its COVID-related revenues."", ""Its forward P/E is barely over 12, and its trailing price-to-sales ratio is a feeble 2.3. I don't think it will continue to trade at such bargain levels for long. Strengthening the buy case is the company's dividend, one of the most steady and reliable in the healthcare sector. At the current share price, it yields more than 6% -- sky-high for a once and future blue chip stock."", 'Jason Hall (Confluent): One look at the chart below may make investors think that Confluent is in trouble.', ""From its early 2023 low to its high point, Confluent's stock price doubled, but then headed lower again before tumbling sharply back past that prior low when it reported third-quarter results in November."", 'What sent its shares tumbling? Frankly, the usual volatility of being a younger, still-developing business. Confluent is a leader in data streaming, and investors are focused on its growth rates and customer expansion. When it reported some churn with a few big customers that would carry over into early 2024, the market kind of freaked out.', ""My analysis says this was an overreaction. Confluent's growth story remains intact."", 'Revenue was up 32% in the third quarter, and Confluent Cloud revenue was up 61%. Its growth has slowed, and investors expect to hear that it slowed further to 22% and 43% in the fourth quarter. (The company will report results for that period on Wednesday.) But Confluent Cloud (its version of Kafka built to live in AWS, Azure, etc) is still expected to grow by more than 40% per year.', 'Customer growth is still in the high-teens percentages, and the number of customers spending $100,000 or more with it annually is growing even faster. As a result, margins are improving and cash flows are getting stronger. The company forecast that it would be free-cash-flow breakeven in the fourth quarter, and expects to start generating positive free cash flow in 2024.', ""So while the market sees risk, I see a company that's getting stronger and safer with each passing quarter. Now's the time to buy this upstart in the brave new world of how businesses manage and use data."", ""Chuck Saletta (Kinder Morgan): Oil and natural gas may not be the sexiest forms of energy these days, but they remain in strong demand throughout the world. Indeed, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's most recent Annual Energy Outlook, oil and natural gas use is expected to stay approximately stable between now and 2050."", ""Beyond that, it's not too far a stretch to project beyond 2050 and presume that even if our supplies of greener energy continue to grow, it will still take a long time after that to completely eliminate oil and natural gas from the world's energy mix. After all, you can't really go from about 20 million barrels of oil per day and 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas use per year to absolutely nothing overnight."", 'In addition, even if you do factor in a decline in oil and natural gas use over the very long haul, pipeline companies like Kinder Morgan are likely to be among the longest-lasting parts of the industry. Pipelines have high up-front costs to build, but they benefit from relatively low costs per barrel of oil or cubic foot of natural gas to transport that energy.', ""As a result, as long as oil and natural gas are needed and have to move from where they're produced to where they're processed and consumed, pipelines will still be needed to move them around. Other transportation methods -- like trucks and trains -- will likely see their use for oil and natural gas transportation drop before pipelines do."", ""Despite those decent prospects for decades to come, Kinder Morgan's shares have basically gone nowhere for more than five years, even as its dividends have continued to recover. Its market capitalization is around $38 billion, and it generated around $5.6 billion in cash from operations over the past 12 months. At that valuation -- less than 7 times its cash-generating ability -- the market is virtually giving up on the company, despite those solid decades likely ahead of it."", 'Kinder Morgan may not be the fastest-growing company on the planet, but given its prospects, its shares certainly look cheap enough to be worth considering at the moment.', ""Although the market does occasionally leave solid companies behind when it rallies, true bargains rarely remain bargains for long. That's why now is the time to take a look for yourself and see if you think these businesses' shares are worth picking up at their current prices. Even if the market doesn't end up bidding them up for big rallies, you just might find yourself with stocks of quality companies you'll be pleased to hold onto for many years to come."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

In fact, many will burn your money and dash your hopes for passive income. So here's one example of a dangerous dividend stock to avoid, and one that's a solid choice for a long-term hold."", ""Shares of Medical Properties Trust\xa0(NYSE: MPW), a healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT), are down by 76% in the last three years. That's a big part of the reason its forward dividend yield is upwards of 27%. Critically, this isn't a stock to buy on the dip to capture its outsized yield. It's one to examine as a lesson for what to look out for and avoid."", 'In a nutshell, Medical Properties Trust buys and rents out healthcare facilities to its tenants, some of whom it invests in. There are many things that can go wrong with that process.', ""If it uses too much debt while buying properties, the costs of servicing the interest payments can become unsustainably high relative to its income. Its debt load is currently in excess of $10 billion, or 122% of its equity. In 2026, it'll need to repay close to $3 billion in debt; it has only $340 million in cash on hand now, and its trailing-12-month net losses are $33 million."", ""If its tenants encounter problems, they may struggle to pay rent on time. One of its largest tenants, Steward Healthcare, which is responsible for approximately 20% of the REIT's revenue as of Q3, is chronically unable to pay its full monthly rent, and is behind on its payments to the tune of $50 million. The company plans to write off hundreds of millions of its rent receivables in its Q4 earnings report. That's a bad sign."", ""Finally, if it can't generate enough cash to pay out to investors, it'll need to slash the dividend again. In 2023, it cut its payment considerably, but more could be on the way. There isn't any hope in sight, either. With tightly constrained resources and little in the way of surging demand for hospital floor space, this business may not recover from its downward spiral. Don't buy this stock."", ""Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) story is somewhat the opposite of Medical Properties Trust. Its stock soared due to its development and sale of the Comirnaty vaccination and Paxlovid antiviral pill for preventing and treating coronavirus infections. But the company's temporarily-bloated top line is deflating from its peak of just over $100 billion in 2022."", 'In essence, Pfizer became a victim of its own success, and when the scramble for tools to fight the pandemic became less intense, it was all but guaranteed to struggle growing.', ""Pfizer's forward yield is now 6.1%, and its coronavirus windfall is eroding rapidly. Nonetheless, its trailing-12-month sales of $68.5 billion are still much higher than its pre-pandemic haul of $40.9 billion in 2019. Management has a plan to increase that sum by quite a bit by scaling up its competition in oncology over the next six years and beyond."", 'The first stage of the plan is already in motion. Pfizer recently purchased Seagen, a biotech developing antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) medicines for various cancers, and it aims to acquire additional companies while also upscaling the output of its pipeline by spending more on research and development.', 'Scaling up will mean increasing its opportunities to grow in the long term. It already has a whopping 31 programs in phase 3 clinical trials, with another 34 in phase 2, so investors can have confidence that the company has a strong roadmap to deliver its dividend for at least the next six to eight years, and likely beyond.', ""Though its payout ratio is relatively high at the moment, at 89% of its annual earnings, returning to growth will ameliorate the situation and give Pfizer more headroom to hike its payment once again. Especially for investors who are willing to buy the stock now when it's down and hold it for a long time (during which it'll be able to deliver a steady stream of cash), Pfizer's shares are an opportunity that's ripe for the taking."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medical Properties Trust right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medical Properties Trust, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Medical Properties Trust wasn't one of them.

However, while the company has some very interesting prospects in AI, it needs to prove that it can compete among other major players.

Meta will pay $0.50 per share to shareholders of record on Feb. 22. On an annualized basis, that works out to a dividend yield of about 0.5%."", 'This dividend yield will likely grow over time as Meta boosts its payout, although share buybacks are still a big part of the equation. Along with the dividend announcement, Meta disclosed that an additional $50 billion had been allocated for share buybacks. Meta poured nearly $20 billion into buying back its own stock in 2023; the dividend will eat up just over $5 billion over the next year if it remains at its current level.', ""For dividend investors, Meta is a tough sell. There's plenty of room to grow the dividend over time; Meta reported a net income of $39 billion and a free cash flow of $44 billion for 2023. However, share buybacks appear to be the priority. If Meta takes the same path as Apple, which has been paying a dividend for a decade but still sports a dividend yield of around 0.5%, the dividend will never be all that consequential."", ""Another wrinkle is Meta's valuation. The stock isn't overly expensive, but it's not cheap, either. With a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion following a post-earnings rally, the stock trades for roughly 27 times free cash flow."", 'While Meta reported strong growth in Q4, with revenue surging 25% year over year and net income more than tripling, there\'s plenty of long-term uncertainty. For one, the core social media business faces the prospect of increased regulation. ""We could regulate you out of business if we wanted to,"" said Senator Thom Tillis during a recent Senate hearing with top social media executives focused on child safety.', ""Meta's vast investments in the metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) also have unclear and uncertain payoffs. Reality Labs, Meta's metaverse-focused division, reported an operating loss of $16 billion in 2023, and the company is pouring additional cash into AI hardware. Improving its various platforms with AI features makes sense, but it will be an expensive proposition."", ""For those not sold on Meta's long-term potential, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) looks like a far better deal. IBM's artificial intelligence strategy is crystal clear: Help its enterprise clients deploy AI technology through a mix of software and consulting services."", ""While IBM's watsonx AI platform is a key component of this strategy, consulting is what brings customers in the door. The company disclosed in its Q4 report that AI commitments from customers doubled in Q4 from Q3, with two-thirds of business driven by the consulting arm."", 'IBM produced $11.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023, and strong demand for AI products and services will contribute to growth in 2024. The company is eyeing $12 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at about 14, or roughly half that of Meta.', ""IBM is growing more slowly than Meta, with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected for 2024. However, IBM's business comes with less uncertainty. While demand for IBM's enterprise software and services will ebb and flow with economic conditions, the company doesn't face existential threats like Meta's social media business, and it isn't relying on a moonshot like Meta's metaverse business."", ""Then there's the dividend. IBM has paid a quarterly dividend uninterrupted since 1916, and it's raised that dividend annually for nearly three decades. Based on the latest quarterly payment of $1.66 per share, IBM stock currently sports a dividend yield of about 3.6%, more than double the S&P 500's meager 1.4% yield."", 'That dividend is well covered by free cash flow. IBM is set to pay out approximately $6.1 billion in dividends over the next year, which will eat up a hair over 50% of its free cash flow. This leaves plenty left over for other uses, including debt reduction, acquisitions, and a potential restart of share buybacks. IBM suspended all share buybacks after its megadeal for software company Red Hat closed in 2019.', ""Shares of IBM have rallied over the past year, gaining nearly 40% as investors started to buy into the company's growth story. While IBM isn't a growth stock like Meta, a combination of less uncertainty, a discounted valuation, and a far more generous dividend makes IBM stock a better buy."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.', 'As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Marathon Petroleum. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Marathon Petroleum, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Marathon Petroleum. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 10% of shares outstanding. With 8.4% and 6.8% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders."", 'On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.', 'While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.', 'The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', ""Our information suggests that Marathon Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$97m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. "", ""With a 21% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Marathon Petroleum. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run."", ""It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Marathon Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance.

This medical information systems company is flying under the radar of most investors as it is a small cap and currently losing money. The thing is, the company recently accelerated its push to profitability. Let’s explore more about this company in this Bull of The Day article.', 'Phreesia, Inc. engages in the provision of patient check-in solutions for medical practices. The firm offers appointments, clinical support, integration, registration, patient activation, analytics and reports, revenue cycle, patient surveys, and privacy and security products. Its solutions include health systems, multi-specialty, and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs).', 'When I look at a stock, the first thing I do is look to see if the company is beating the number. This tells me right away where the market’s expectations have been for the company and how management has communicated to the market. A stock that consistently beats has management communicating expectations to Wall Street that can be achieved. That is what you want to see.', 'For Phreesia, I see four beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last year. The average positive earnings surprise over the last year works out to be a positive 12.2%.', 'The most recent beat saw an acceleration in the push to profitability. The loss per share was decreasing by two cents in each of the previous quarters, but that changed in the October 2023 quarter. The loss per share was down to $0.58 and that represented a 10 cent improvement.', 'Earnings estimates revisions is what the Zacks Rank is all about.', 'Following the most recent quarter estimates have trended higher.', 'The consensus estimate for the current quarter stood at a loss of $0.71 before the report and has since moved to a loss of $0.58.', 'Next quarter has seen the consensus move from a loss of $0.68 to a loss of $0.50.', 'The full fiscal year 2024 estimate Has moved from a loss of $2.61 to a loss of $2.32.', 'Next year has moved from a loss of $2.00 to a loss of $1.43.', 'These estimate revisions are all headed in the right direction and tell us that the company is pushing towards profitability.', 'No earnings means no PE to lean on so we look at the price to book. The price to book multiple is 5.4x which is a little high for a company not earning money, but also could be double that when they reach profitability. Price to sales comes in at 4.3x and operating margins continue to improve over the last few quarters.', 'LCI Industries is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as earnings estimates have tracked lower due following a recent earnings miss. The company is in the automotive equipment space and specializes in the components for recreational vehicles and manufactured houses. This article will look at why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as it is the Bear of the Day.', ""LCI Industries is a supplier of components to the recreational vehicle and manufactured housing industries as well as adjacent industries including bus, cargo and equestrian trailer, marine and heavy truck.

For LCII I see annual estimates moving lower of late.', 'The current fiscal year (2023) consensus number moved lower from $3.08 to $2.91 over the last 60 days.', 'The next year moved from a gain of $7.35 to $7.04 over the last 60 days.', 'Negative movement in earnings estimates like that is why this stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).', 'It should be noted that a lot of stocks in the Zacks universe are seeing negative earnings estimate revisions.

However, things have begun to look hunky-dory for cruise lines post-pandemic as travel restrictions were lifted. The cruise liners took advantage of the pent-up demand and booked profits in recent times.', 'Consumers have started to open up their wallets for leisure and recreational activities, which led to record bookings for cruise liners. Consumers are confident about their well-being as steady economic growth squashed concerns about an impending recession, while jobs were added to the economy at a steady clip.', 'The consumer confidence index came in at 114.8 in January from December’s revised reading of 108.0, and it also hit a two-year high, per the Conference Board. A separate measure that shows how confident consumers are about the economy at the moment rose to its strongest level since the onset of the pandemic. At the same time, consumers remain optimistic that the economy is well-poised to improve soon, which no doubt bodes well for discretionary players like cruise liners.', 'Thus, with the current macroeconomic scenario in favor of cruise liners, investors should certainly place their bets on two top-notch cruise operators, such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Carnival Corporation & plc.

The reading is in sharp contrast to a loss of $500 million reported in the same period a year ago.', 'Revenues came in at a healthy $3.33 billion in the fourth quarter, up 28% from year-ago levels, and were mostly led by a considerable increase in passenger tickets. The cruise operator recently witnessed record booking in terms of rate and volume to begin the Wave season. This is when cruise promotions heighten, particularly in the first quarter of a year.', 'Looking forward, the cruise operator expects its net income to improve as consumers continue to spend on experiences and inflationary pressures cool down. For the first quarter, the company’s management sees adjusted earnings per share to come in at $1.10 to $1.20, which will be in contrast to a loss of 23 cents a share reported last year.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 0.6% over the past 60 days. Royal Caribbean’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year are a remarkable 188.4% and 38%, respectively. The company’s projected revenue growth rates for the current and next years are 57.7% and 14.1%, respectively.', 'Similarly, Carnival is seeing record travel bookings across the board for the first half of the year as consumers are splurging on travel with the worst of the pandemic being over. Carnival has predicted an adjusted EBITDA of around $5.6 billion for 2024, which is more than 30% compared to last year.', 'In the fourth quarter, Carnival posted revenues of $5.4 billion, up 41% from the same period a year ago. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CCL’s current-year earnings has moved up 9.9% over the past 60 days.

Though semiconductors rarely make popular headlines, the shift in political goals across East Asia has brought them into the spotlight. Rising tensions regarding the future of Taiwan and continuously strained supply lines have renewed commitments to returning manufacturing to the U.S.', 'Furthermore, with increasing levels of development around the world, over five billion people rely on computers.

Now, with ADI’s recent investment into a new Oregon-based factory, the company sits in a perfect position to expand profits. Despite being more costly, the benefits of domestic production cannot be overstated when considering ADI’s defense customers.', 'As the need for military production supply lines ramps up, ADI’s new facility provides shorter lead times and greater security. It also allows Analog Devices to capitalize on federal grants intended to financially sweeten the deal. Take into consideration lagging production investments from competitors, and it makes sense why this stable stock sits at “moderate buy“.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'Advanced Micro Devices‘ (NASDAQ:AMD) stock soared over 145% in the past year, thanks to the introduction of training AI with graphics processing units (GPUs). This increase in demand catapulted AMD’s GPU sales, but the company continues to focus on its standard processors as well.', 'By offering a spectrum of processors, AMD aims to serve every computer manufacturer’s needs. From low-performance, energy-efficient chips, to monstrously fast, high-speed processors, AMD has a product for every price point. This same philosophy extends to its GPU prices, with its prices consistently coming in below the competition’s.', 'AMD’s push for a wider product portfolio also includes specializing its general processors for more dedicated tasks. Take for example the newly unveiled Radeon RX 7600 XT graphics card from AMD. Priced at only $350, the 7600 XT offers an affordable entry into the world of gaming and training AI. Innovations like this and a push towards providing accessible technology, make AMD a “strong buy” among 2024 chip stocks.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Finally, when discussing chip stocks, it is impossible to not mention Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Though headquartered in Taiwan, its aggressive expansion in the U.S. comes as the demand for reliable electronics supply chains soars. Its new facility in Arizona and newly announced second facility in Japan generously expand production capacity.', 'These expansions come while demand for semiconductors remains at an all-time high post-pandemic. Further concerns over potential conflicts between China and Taiwan also underscore the need for TSMC to increase production abroad. This provides Taiwan Semiconductor with the ability to fulfill backlogged orders and continue to operate, should any issues arise.', 'New facilities also mean improved manufacturing equipment and efficiency, further improving TSMC’s position.

While cash is still relevant, prudent investors want to capitalize on the global transformation away from cash.', 'There are many exciting growth companies in the payment sector, but investors should not forget about the most dominant players, all of which continually grow market share and return capital to shareholders. With that in mind, here are three payment stocks worth adding to your portfolio.', ""Beyond being a favorite stock of Warren Buffett, who has owned it in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio since 1991, American Express (NYSE: AXP) is a powerhouse for payments across the globe. Investors might be surprised to learn that American Express generates more revenue annually than competitors Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and Visa (NYSE: V) combined."", 'That\'s partly due to American Express\' ""closed-loop"" network, which allows it to charge higher merchant fees and annual fees for cardholders versus Mastercard and Visa\'s ""open-loop"" network that seeks volume. Therefore, Mastercard and Visa individually generate more net income than American Express despite less revenue.', 'Focusing on American Express, the company recently reported its 2023 annual earnings, which featured revenue of $60.5 billion in revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.21, a year-over-year increase of 14% for both metrics. Additionally, management gave its bullish outlook for 2024, including revenue growth between 9% and 11% and a diluted EPS increase of 13% to 17%.', 'American Express prioritizes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since 1989, the company has consistently paid a quarterly dividend, recently increasing it by 17% to $0.70 per share. Additionally, aggressive share buybacks by management have reduced outstanding shares by 14% over the past five years to 723 million outstanding shares, and the company is in the early stages of a 120 million share repurchase program.', ""Because of its closed-loop network, American Express is susceptible to defaults. So it expenses these possible defaults as provisions for credit losses. It's a non-cash expense that accounts for expected losses likely to default or become unrecoverable over the next year. The metric grew from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $4.9 billion in 2023, or 123%, due to elevated interest rates that continue to weigh on some businesses and consumers."", ""Still, on a valuation basis, American Express stock looks cheap compared to its competitors using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a stock price to its forward earnings. American Express' forward P/E ratio multiple stands at 16, which is significantly lower than Mastercard's and Visa's P/E ratios of 32 and 28, respectively."", 'Mastercard is the second-largest payment company worldwide, with a market capitalization of $431 billion and 3.3 million cards under its own name and its Maestro brand. The company has increased its dividend for 13 consecutive years, recently increasing its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.66 per share.', 'Like American Express, Mastercard continually buys back its outstanding shares, reducing its share count by 9% over the past five years. Additionally, the company has approximately $13.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program after spending $9 billion in 2023.', ""One of Mastercard's key drivers for growth is consumer spending, which has held up firmly despite elevated interest rates and inflation pressures. Digging into Mastercard's financials, the company generated $25.1 billion in revenue and $12.26 in adjusted EPS for 2023, a year-over-year increase of 13% and 15%, respectively. Management also provided a positive outlook for 2024, predicting net revenue will grow 13% to 15%."", 'Finding a bear case for Mastercard is challenging, but one area to watch is increased antitrust regulation. Last year, Mastercard and Visa settled a nearly decade-long class action lawsuit for $5.6 billion, addressing allegations from over 12 million retailers who claimed that the payment giants had improperly fixed fees on credit and debit cards. As a result of the increased scrutiny, Mastercard is putting more money aside for litigation provisions, expensing $308 million in its most recent quarter alone.', ""Despite increased competition, antitrust concerns, and pressures on consumer spending, Mastercard's growth appears unaffected. Better yet, management's focus on returning capital to shareholders makes it easier for long-term investors to buy and hold."", 'The last stock on this list, Visa, is the largest company by market capitalization among its peers at $561 billion. As previously referenced, the payments giant operates more like Mastercard than American Express, relying on consumer volume for success. Visa is another shareholder-friendly stock with a long history of rising dividends and share repurchases.', 'Visa currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.75%. Also, management has repurchased approximately 9% of its outstanding shares over the past five years and had $26.4 billion of remaining authorized funds for share repurchases as of Dec. 31, 2023.', 'Beyond its dividends and share repurchases, Visa\'s revenue isn\'t growing quite as fast as Mastercard\'s, but it\'s still impressive given its size. Specifically, Visa generated $33.1 billion in revenue for its fiscal year 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 11%. Also, management\'s revenue guidance for its fiscal year 2024 is in the ""low double-digits,"" meaning likely between 10% and 12%.', ""Where Visa excels is its operating margin -- the percentage of revenue a company keeps after accounting for operating expenses -- which stood at 69% for its most recently reported quarter. For comparison, Mastercard's operating margin was 56% for its most recent quarter. In other words, Visa is more efficient than Mastercard in turning revenue into profit. Over the trailing 12 months, Visa posted $18 billion in net income versus Mastercard's $11.2 billion."", ""Naturally, investors can have a fear of missing out when it comes to stocks. In the payment sector, cryptocurrency and buy now, pay later are exciting newcomers, but don't forget about the established giants in the space. Whether it's outperforming the market or collecting income, American Express, Mastercard, and Visa are the ideal stocks for any long-term investor."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

But don't let that distract you from the fact that both of their shares have crushed the S&P 500 in the last 10 years."", ""It's not hard to figure out why Visa and Mastercard are two of the best businesses on the face of the planet. They benefit from the growth of digital payments, possess powerful network effects, and are incredibly profitable."", ""However, these companies face two key risks that investors need to be aware of. The good news, though, is that I view them as being somewhat overblown. Here's why."", ""Combined, Visa and Mastercard account for 87% of all card payment volume that occurs in the U.S. This dominant duopoly position is something that regulators aren't really comfortable with, as the Durbin Amendment shows. This amendment was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 to lower debit card interchange fees."", 'The hope of the Durbin Amendment was that it would lower prices for customers because it would save money for merchants. But a study showed that only 1% of retailers lowered prices. To make matters worse, the number of banks that offer debit cards with rewards has dropped substantially.', ""On the surface, this legislative move should've benefited the industry and its stakeholders. However, I think it represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation."", ""Visa and Mastercard get a lot of hate due specifically to interchange fees. But it's critical to understand that the bulk of any credit card transaction fee, which is the interchange, goes to the issuing banks. This could be JPMorgan Chase or Bank of America, to name just two examples."", ""These financial institutions must find customers, run credit checks, assume default risk, handle ongoing payments, and fund costly rewards and perks for cardholders. For all of this, a valid argument can be made that the interchange fee is adequate. But one could also argue that Visa and Mastercard shouldn't be the targets of this regulation, as they don't collect this interchange."", ""If these fees are too high, customers still have the choice to pay for things with cash instead of plastic. On the flip side, merchants, who bear the cost of accepting card payments, can simply restrict customers to only using cash. But if they did this, they'd miss out on a huge number of sales. This points to how both customers and merchants see a lot of value in card transactions, a fact that regulators have probably ignored."", 'Another possible cause of worry for Visa and Mastercard shareholders has been the innovation and disruption taking place in digital payments, primarily in the past decade or so. Companies like PayPal, Block, Apple, Adyen, and Stripe have all helped to accelerate the war on cash.', ""The immediate thought might be that these businesses and their various services would spell the beginning of the end of Visa's and Mastercard's dominance. But this couldn't be further from the truth."", 'In the last 10 years, Visa and Mastercard have increased their quarterly payment volumes by 113% and 121%, respectively. And they have typically posted double-digit revenue and earnings growth like clockwork.', 'This tells me that the competitive positions of these two companies are virtually indestructible. The other takeaway is that fintech innovation actually benefits Visa and Mastercard because it helps propel greater card usage, while encouraging lower cash usage.', ""While smart investors should always be familiar with a company's risks, in this case, two major concerns are probably overblown."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

Just a few months ago, IBM released watsonx.governance -- a tool for AI compliance protocols.', ""While it's still nascent, major corporations such as accounting and consulting firm Deloitte have deployed the governance software in its risk management practice. Additional use cases for Watson's governance capabilities include financial services such as bill approval, as well as ethical hiring practices."", 'Admittedly, IBM is a bit different from other enterprise technology businesses. The company was late to the game in cloud computing, lagging innovative solutions from Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud. However, its $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat in 2019 has helped it turn things around a bit.', 'What really sets IBM apart from the competition, however, is its consulting practice. ""We continue to believe our consulting business will be an early beneficiary of AI,"" CEO Arvind Krishna stated during the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings call. ""We are the only provider today that offers both a technology stack with our watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI.""', 'Generally speaking, software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses primarily focus on selling subscriptions. Recurring software licenses generate steady, predictable revenue that tends to carry a high margin. By contrast, consulting services are typically non-recurring and come with much lower margin profiles compared to software. Therefore, many enterprise tech companies may shy away from a heavy focus on professional services.', ""But during the fourth quarter, one-third of the company's bookings related to generative AI came from software. The other two-thirds came from deals signed through the consulting arm. IBM's unique business model is actually turning the consulting operation into a channel for more software revenue, specifically in AI."", ""The chart above depicts IBM's revenue, gross profit, and free cash flow on a quarterly basis over the last decade. It's easy to see that the company's financial trends have experienced some dramatic peaks and valleys over the last few years."", ""What's a little surprising, however, is the company's valuation. As of the time of this article, IBM stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.5 -- well above the company's 10-year average of 14.7."", ""If you're looking to invest outside of the bigger names in AI, IBM could represent a solid long-term opportunity. However, while the company has some very interesting prospects in AI, it needs to prove that it can compete among other major players. In 2023, IBM's total revenue only grew by 2%, and the company guided for growth in the mid-single-digit percentages for this year."", ""With the stock soaring since IBM reported fourth-quarter earnings last week, I think it could be a little overbought. I see the company as well-positioned to benefit from rising demand in AI and think it's quietly becoming an influential player in the space. But with its valuation hovering around its highest level in a decade, my concern is that AI hype is priced into IBM at the moment."", 'Nevertheless, as the company continues to reinvent itself and make inroads in the ever-evolving landscape of generative AI, IBM certainly looks intriguing and could be worth keeping an eye on.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

With this recent realization, downturns are likely not on the minds of most investors at this moment."", ""However, due to the cyclical state of markets, investors should expect another bear market at some point and have a plan to deal with that scenario. Fortunately, bear markets are a great time to buy high-quality stocks on sale, and when that time comes, investors should consider loading up on Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). Here's why."", 'Admittedly, Nvidia may not seem like much of a ""pullback stock."" The stock has risen nearly sixfold since its October 2022 low, and at a forward P/E ratio of 32, it is not as pricey as investors might assume.', 'Still, Nvidia also has a history of massive declines during bear markets. When it reached its October 2022 low, the stock had fallen by more than two-thirds from its previous all-time high in November 2021. Also, when the market turned bearish in late 2018, Nvidia lost more than half of its value in the last three months of that year.', 'Nonetheless, investors should also know that the gains following those declines more than made up for the bear market losses.', ""Today, Nvidia's dominant position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market has buoyed the stock. This led to massive revenue growth for the company. In the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29. 2023), revenue of $39 billion surged 86% higher compared with the same period in fiscal 2023."", ""Consequently, net income reached more than $17 billion in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Nvidia earned only $3 billion during the same time frame in 2023. Between AI's rising popularity and Nvidia's history, any pullback will become a likely buying opportunity."", ""The internet fostered a lucrative digital advertising industry, and ad-related tools have become increasingly crucial amid that rise. To that end, The Trade Desk's ad tech platform has become a go-to for media buyers. Through the platform, agencies and advertisers can manage ad campaigns."", 'In the same vein as Roku, it has developed a reputation for neutrality, which reduces the odds of biased ad spending that could become an issue with an ad giant such as Google parent Alphabet.', 'Admittedly, The Trade Desk stock is tied to the state of ad spending. The last downturn occurred in 2022, leading to a stock decline of as much as two-thirds.', 'Despite that sell-off, the Trade Desk is doing what it needs to keep such declines temporary. This is because the business continued to grow even as the stock experienced a bear market sell-off.', 'During the 2022 downturn, revenue increased 32% yearly. Also, the $1.3 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 rose by 23%. Nonetheless, it turned profitable during that time, reporting $82 million in net income in the first nine months of 2023, up from an $18 million loss during the same timeframe in 2022.', 'Due to the improved profitability, the Trade Desk sells for about 49 times forward earnings. Whether the stock goes up or down, profits are likely to see rapid improvement, making The Trade Desk stock a buy on just about any pullback.', 'MercadoLibre is a strong sell-off stock because the company has learned to prosper in an often hostile environment. This region often contends with government bureaucracy, political turmoil, and high inflation.', 'Yet MercadoLibre thrives because of these challenges. It supports e-commerce, giving merchants an additional sales outlet.', ""Moreover, to reach more of Latin America's cash-based customers, it started Mercado Pago, which can facilitate e-commerce transactions for those who lack access to the traditional banking system."", 'Also, Mercado Envios handles fulfillment and logistics. The company introduced one- and two-day shipping to markets where it had not been previously available.', ""Such businesses are recession-resistant. Thus, it should surprise few that businesses brought in $10.2 billion in the first nine months of 2023, a 36% increase year over year. Interestingly, that represents a slowdown from 2022's 48% revenue growth rate, a time when the stock suffered through a bear market."", 'Nonetheless, MercadoLibre generated a net income of $822 million during that period, up from $317 million in the first three quarters of 2022. Furthermore, its revenue growth continued during the 2022 bear market, even as the stock sold off at the time.', ""Not surprisingly, MercadoLibre's stock eventually recovered, rising by just under 50% over the last year. Despite that gain, it sells for 52 times forward earnings. With its rapid revenue growth in good times and bad, investors can safely buy the stock at this level."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

This margin improvement included a positive impact of about 400 basis points from lower energy cost pass-through. However, the company's overall sales decreased by 6% to $3.0 billion, primarily due to an 11% lower energy cost pass-through, which negatively affected sales but had no impact on net income."", ""Despite these challenges, Air Products' financial achievements are significant within the chemicals industry. The company's ability to increase pricing and volumes in a tough economic climate demonstrates its strong market position and operational efficiency. The increased dividend also reflects a commitment to shareholder returns, reinforcing the company's financial stability and confidence in its long-term growth strategy."", ""The Americas segment saw a 10% decrease in sales but improved operating income and adjusted EBITDA, driven by higher pricing and volumes, particularly in hydrogen demand. Asia's sales increased by 2%, although operating income and adjusted EBITDA faced declines due to unfavorable volume mix and higher costs.

Long-term debt increased to $11.7 billion, reflecting ongoing investments in growth initiatives. Cash provided by operating activities was $626.6 million for the quarter, while cash used for investing activities was significantly higher at $1.7 billion, primarily due to additions to plant and equipment."", ""Air Products' Chairman, President, and CEO Seifi Ghasemi commented on the results, stating:"", '""Despite significant geopolitical and economic headwinds, the team at Air Products performed well, increasing our adjusted EPS by seven percent over last year.

In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.', 'In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans\' future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans. We may also exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future.', 'When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.', 'We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.', 'ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS', 'The table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance.

Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building & construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture.', 'Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities, and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride), and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide).

Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.', 'Demand Headwinds From End-market Softness: Companies in the chemical-diversified space remain challenged by demand weakness in certain key markets. The sluggishness in the building & construction market and the destocking in consumer electronics are the key concerns. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building & construction.', 'The housing market is bearing the brunt of interest rate hikes. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes.

Global industrial activities have been affected by a weaker demand recovery in China.', 'The slowdown in Europe, resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation and rising interest rates, has also led to softer demand in that region. The energy and feedstock inflation has resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The ongoing weakness in these key regions is likely to impact demand for chemicals over the short haul.', 'Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows.

Some companies are in a great position to see improving revenue and profits over the next few years that could send their share prices soaring. Here's why entertainment juggernaut Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) and fast-growing restaurant chain Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) are great buys."", ""The transition to a digital-first entertainment company hasn't been easy for Disney. The investments in streaming content have dug a hole in its bottom line, while its legacy-media networks (e.g., ABC and ESPN) are low-growth assets that have struggled to maintain stable revenue in a weak advertising market."", ""However, Disney announced in November it was hiring Pepsico's Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston as senior executive vice president and CFO. Johnston did an excellent job guiding Pepsico's financial decision-making over the past decade that contributed to the snack food giant's profitable growth and returns to shareholders. It's an important hire for Disney at a time when investors want to see more financial discipline from the company in order to reverse the stock's recent fall."", 'Disney was already moving in the right direction. The losses in the direct-to-consumer business (e.g., Disney+ and Hulu) narrowed significantly in recent quarters, driven by subscriber growth and price increases. As a result, management believes they are on track to reach profitability by September of this year.', ""As for the rest of the business, management says the media networks have tremendous opportunities to improve margins, while Disney's parks and experiences are thriving, generating higher revenue and profits than four years ago."", ""Johnston should help steer Disney toward a decade of profitable growth. The stock price hit a low of $78 last year, but it's already rallied to $97. This is still a deep discount to where Disney traded a few years ago and may undervalue the future value of this beloved entertainment brand."", 'When a new bull market is underway, it can pay off big time to look for small, fast-growing restaurant chains that could thrive in a growing economy. Just ask early investors of Chipotle Mexican Grill. A $1,000 investment in Chipotle stock at the bottom of the 2008 bear market would be worth $38,000 today. There are good reasons Dutch Bros has the right formula to deliver similar returns to investors.', 'Dutch Bros stock has been weighed down by choppy comparable-store sales lately, but its unique menu of flavorful sodas and coffees is resonating in every market it has expanded into so far.', 'Through the end of the third quarter, Dutch Bros was present in just 16 states. These shops are generating a high contribution profit margin of 31%, up from 25.6%, in Q3 2022, which is exceptional.', 'One important factor that can make Dutch Bros a successful growth story is its focus on opening company-operated shops. The company promotes veteran Dutch Bros ""broistas"" to lead every new shop opening, which could drive consistent shop-level performance.', 'Growth investors looking for a stock that can soar over the next decade should look no further. Dutch Bros has consistently reported revenue growth above 30% year over year, and with profits starting to follow, the stock is poised to move higher as the company expands to more states.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

VAL, Helmerich & Payne HP and Seadrill Ltd. SDRL.', 'Industry: Oil & Gas Drilling', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2220015/3-promising-oil-gas-drilling-stocks-amid-industry-tumult', 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry has lately been pegged back by the impending end to their legacy high-margin contracts, uncertainties related to slowing upstream capital expenditure growth and inflationary pressures. Although macro challenges are leading to some moderation in activity, we think the space still has fuel left in the tank, especially for the operators that target growth opportunities and operating efficiency initiatives. We advise investors to focus on Valaris Ltd., Helmerich & Payne and Seadrill Ltd.', 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry consists of companies that provide rigs (or specialized vehicles) on a contractual basis to explore and develop oil and gas. These operators offer drilling rigs (both land-based/onshore and offshore), equipment, services and manpower to exploration and production companies worldwide. Drilling for hydrocarbons is costly and technically difficult, and its future primarily depends on contracting activity and the total number of available rigs at a given time rather than the price of oil or gas.', ""Within the industry, it's interesting to note that the volatility associated with offshore drilling companies is much higher than their onshore counterparts, and their share prices are more correlated to the price of oil. Overall, drilling stocks are among the most volatile in the entire equity market."", 'Capital Investment Tightness: Despite the improvement in oil prices, for most upstream operators, the focus is still on sustaining the lower spending levels, further trimming breakeven costs and maintaining financial health. Agreed, costs have been slashed and completion activity is looking up, too, but overcapacity and pricing pressure would restrict the positive impact. With customers drilling fewer wells, the demand for oilfield service work has taken a hit. As a supplier of drilling rigs and equipment to the E&P sector, the sentiment toward the industry remains rather uncertain and opaque.', ""Concerns About Cost Escalation: Most energy companies (including the drilling operators) have been experiencing rising costs in the form of increased expenses related to maintenance and inventory. Despite moderating from record levels, U.S. inflation is still running above the Fed's target. This, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting their capital programs."", 'Apart from being hard to ignore, escalation in expenses is also drowning out the benefits of any commodity price increase. In our view, the inflation-associated headwinds will continue to challenge growth and margin numbers with little chance of a quick resolution. This may lead to a rough road for oil/gas equities engaged in drilling.', 'Low Reserve Replenishment a Silver Lining: One of the key positive arguments for drillers is the focus on the reserve replacement rate. Over the past few years, the supermajors have struggled to replace all of the oil and gas they churn out, raising concerns about future production. In this context, Chevron’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% indicates the inability to add proved reserves to the amount of oil and gas produced. This clearly calls for a calibrated approach to meeting reserve shortfalls in the long run. Consequently, a gradual improvement in drilling activity looks likely.', 'Wind-Down of Legacy, High-Margin Contracts: For most operators, order levels have remained depressed, and day rates are trending just above cash costs despite the strong rebound in commodity prices. This has put increased pressure on their revenue-generating capacity. Further, as the companies’ legacy, high-margin contracts wind down slowly, drillers are faced with the prospect of a drop in backlog (and consequently, revenues), which is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters. This also leaves drillers vulnerable to addressing their massive debt maturities and investment in newbuilds.', 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #208, which places it in the bottom 17% of around 250 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. As a matter of fact, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2024 have gone down 60.9% in the past year.', 'Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.', 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - Drilling industry has fared worse than the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector as well as the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.', 'The industry has gone down 18.3% over this period compared with the broader sector’s decrease of 2.5%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained 17.1%.', 'Since oil and gas drilling companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of non-cash expenses.', 'On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 16.67X, higher than the S&P 500’s 14.05X. It is also well above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.63X.', 'Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 24.76X, as low as 7.28X, with a median of 13.14X.', ""Valaris Limited: Valaris possesses a varied fleet of rigs, including ultra-deepwater drillships, versatile semisubmersibles, and modern shallow-water jackups. With the industry's largest and highest specification fleet covering both floaters and jackups, Valaris maintains a significant presence in key offshore basins, fostering deep customer relationships. The company's robust balance sheet ensures flexibility in capital allocation."", 'Hamilton-based VALs Value and Growth Score of C and B helps it to round out with a VGM Score of B. The company has a market capitalization of $4.5 billion. Valaris stock, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has lost 15.8% in a year.', 'You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. ', 'Helmerich & Payne: Helmerich & Payne is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States & internationally. Its technologically advanced FlexRigs are much in demand. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has already upgraded most of its drilling fleet with the latest technology. Besides, Helmerich & Payne boasts a strong balance sheet, carrying little long-term debt. With available liquidity surpassing debt levels and no significant near-term maturities, Helmerich & Payne should sail through any difficult operating environment.', 'Tulsa, OK-based HP’s Value and Growth Score of B each helps it to round out with a VGM Score of A. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed in the other. The Helmerich & Payne stock has lost 13.3% in a year.', 'Seadrill Limited: Seadrill is a market-leading international driller with strong exposure in key strategic basins like the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil and Angola. Following the Aquadrill LLC acquisition last year, SDRL has improved its cash flow generation potential significantly. A robust balance sheet, enhanced liquidity and credit profile are the other positives in the Seadill story. The company has transformed its capital structure through accretive transactions and continues to deliver operational excellence.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked offshore driller’s 2023 earnings has been revised 14.8% upward over the past 90 days.

So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.30."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, United Rentals has a superior ROE than the average (17%) in the Trade Distributors industry."", ""That is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', ""United Rentals does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.39. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Robbins gives you a big smile, a warm hug and invites into a total transformation package, turning all your visions, dreams and desires into reality.', 'What I’m trying to get at is this: you don’t necessarily have to compromise. For example, a typical life coach may lead you to improve your resume. You might find a great job with a high salary and excellent benefits in no time. On the other hand, a spiritual advisor can lead you to a path of personal wellness and discovery but at the expense of constant financial worries.', 'That’s where Tony Robbins and his captivating presence enters the stage. Just because you collect passive income every quarter (or whatever the case may be) doesn’t mean you can’t get decent returns. On the flipside, growth doesn’t always spell zero dividends.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Get them both. No compromises. Below are compelling high-yield dividend stocks with potential for significant upside.', 'Source: BalkansCat / Shutterstock.com', 'A resource mining enterprise, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) could be an intriguing way to play the volatile electric vehicle market. As I pointed out recently, EV upstart Polestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) was forced to cut around 15% of its workforce. Multiple factors, including a huge EV inventory dump along with a sector-wide price war imposed substantial hardships on individual players. So, it’s anyone’s guess which one of these pure-play EV makers will come out on top.', 'But if the sector were to rise, all these vehicles would need lithium among other critical resources. Rio Tinto provides exactly that along with other important resources like aluminum and copper. Unsurprisingly, analysts rate shares a unanimous strong buy with an $81.19 average price target. That implies growth potential of almost 15%.', 'Just as well, Rio Tinto offers a forward dividend yield of 5%. That’s well above the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Further, the payout ratio lands at 49.11%, providing confidence regarding yield sustainability. Overall, it makes a great case for high-yield dividend stocks with potential for capital gains.', 'Source: Nico Bekasinski / Shutterstock.com', 'A leading developer and marketer of toys and games, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) owns several iconic brands, including Transformers, Monopoly, and Nerf. In addition, the company creates digital games and entertainment experiences. Basically, so long as there are kids around, Hasbro should command permanent relevance. And even though the toy industry is super competitive, its well-recognized brands distinguish it from the others.', 'To be fair, Hasbro hasn’t exactly enjoyed a stellar time in the market recently. Over the trailing one-year period, HAS gave up nearly 13% of equity value. Still, that could make it a contrarian opportunity for daring investors. On the capital gains side, analysts view HAS as a consensus moderate buy with a $61.38 price target. That implies upside of just over 20%.', 'As for passive income, the company carries a forward yield of 5.48%. That stands well above the consumer discretionary sector’s average yield of 1.89%. To be fair, the payout ratio is a bit elevated at 66.15%. Still, that’s not terrible given the generous payout. Thus, it’s another solid idea for high-yield dividend stocks with potential.', 'Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock', 'I don’t want to beat a dead horse as I’ve already talked about Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) multiple times. However, the topic of high-yield dividend stocks with potential for capital gains is a very specific one: relatively speaking, there aren’t that many enterprises that qualify. However, the tobacco giant certainly does.', 'Yes, it’s in a controversial industry and one that’s fading: global smoking prevalence rates are definitely on the decline. However, the tobacco firms have a clear edge in developing e-cigarette or vaporizer products. Essentially, these companies know smokers the best. Therefore, they can tailor make digital solutions that truly resonate with this core audience.', 'As for the discussion at hand, Philip Morris offers a forward yield of 5.72%, well above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. Additionally, the company features 16 years of consecutive dividend increases.', 'Lastly, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $104.75 price target, implying over 15% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the high-yield dividend stocks with potential.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'If you want to dial up your prospects for capital gains and passive income to “11” all on the same security, look no further than B2Gold (NYSEAMERICAN:BTG). A Canadian mining enterprise, B2Gold owns and operates gold mines in Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines. On a narrative basis, BTG theoretically should benefit from the Federal Reserve’s dovish monetary policy pivot – if it goes through with it. That’s still a big “if.”', 'Moreover, BTG just hasn’t resonated with investors. In the trailing 52 weeks, shares gave up nearly 32% of equity value. That’s not exactly encouraging when the underlying asset has gone back up to above the $2,000 level. However, a case can be made that B2Gold is merely lagging behind its competitors. To lend credibility to this idea, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $4.68 price target.', 'If you do the quick math, the forecast comes out with a return potential of almost 70%. Just as well, on the passive income side, B2Gold offers a forward yield of 5.8%. That’s a big gap compared to the materials sector’s average yield of 2.82%. Thus, BTG deserves consideration for high-yield dividend stocks with potential.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) really needs no introduction. Recently, of course, the company generated waves thanks to its efforts in forwarding a Covid-19 vaccine. However, that narrative has suffered as fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus slipped into the rear-view mirror. Nevertheless, PFE could be one of the compelling high-yield dividend stocks with potential because of the underlying acumen.', 'As you likely know, Pfizer went with a messenger-RNA-based approach to its Covid vaccine. Looking out to the future, the scientific community believes that mRNA could possibly be used to help treat cancer. If so, Pfizer represents one of the companies that command a significant advantage.', 'Currently, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $32.56 price target. Should PFE get there, we’re talking a return of almost 19%. As well, the high-side target clocks in at $45, projecting nearly 64% growth potential.', 'For passive income, Pfizer carries a forward yield of 6.12%. That just screams past the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. If you can accept volatility risk, It presents an intriguing canvas.', 'Source: A.PAES / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Brazil, Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) – whose official name translates to Brazilian Petroleum Corporation – represents a hydrocarbon powerhouse. What’s intriguing about PBR is its market performance. Despite the coordinated efforts of major oil-producing nations to cut production, the impact didn’t yield higher prices. Therefore, many oil giants suffered. Not PBR. It gained 51% of equity value over the past 52 weeks.', 'Even with the robust print, Petrobras may have more room to run. Even though the company enjoys a strong 38.7% three-year EBITDA growth rate, PBR remains undervalued, trading at 4.28X forward earnings. Not only that, analysts peg shares a unanimous strong buy with an $18.94 average price target. Should it get there, investors can expect a return of 11%. Plus, the high-side target lands at $21.20, implying over 24% growth.', 'Turning to passive income, Petrobras offers a forward dividend yield of 6.43%. That’s conspicuously above the energy sector’s average yield, which is already high at 4.24%. Therefore, PBR ranks among the high-yield dividend stocks with potential.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the riskiest ideas among high-yield dividend stocks with potential, Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) doesn’t initially seem particularly treacherous. An automaker featuring renowned brands such as Alfa Romeo, Jeep, and Dodge, Stellantis saw its market value jump over 36% in the trailing one-year period. That’s not bad at all. Again, when you look at the pure-play EV manufacturers, STLA is looking mighty fine.', 'Still, the long-term assumption remains the same: EVs are the future of mobility and transportation. And so, perhaps inevitably, Stellantis will need to get with the times. And it’s doing just that. Moreover, the upcoming electric-powered Dodge Charger could potentially change the game. Here, we’re talking about muscle car brawn becoming integrated with the new paradigm of mobility.', 'Sure enough, analysts appear quite enthusiastic about STLA’s prospects, rating it a consensus strong buy. What’s more, the average price target clocks in at $25.85, implying nearly 22% upside potential. Finally, we gotta talk passive income. Stellantis offers a massive forward yield of 6.9%. With the payout ratio sitting at under 25%, STLA is one of the high-yield dividend stocks with potential.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Tomé had the wind at her back. For the past year, however, a gale force storm has been blowing right at the company. The question is whether she can steer Big Brown through an environment bereft of tailwinds that mayh have spawned a false sense of security.', 'From mid-2020 to early 2023, UPS (NYSE: UPS) fired on all cylinders, propelled by massive and unsustainable spikes in delivery demand from the pandemic, fat rate and yield increases, big operating margins, unprecedented dividend hikes, and relatively muted competition. A legacy Teamsters contract that took effect in 2018 enabled UPS to sidestep much of the post-COVID labor cost inflation that hit its chief rival, FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX). Business was so good that UPS could afford to cap volumes from large enterprise customers, even telling them to look elsewhere for capacity.', 'Wall Street loved it. UPS shares, which traded at $103 a share in mid-February 2020, climbed to $224 in less than two years, a stunning ascent for a mature company in\xa0 cyclical, low-margin businesses like transportation and logistics.', 'The second version bears no resemblance to the first. Volumes have reverted to the mean, receding to pre-pandemic levels. Flat demand and overcapacity has stripped UPS and other carriers of pricing power, a scenario that will likely extend through 2024 and beyond. Business that UPS may have turned away two years ago is now being heartily welcomed. “We’re now seeing UPS seek package volumes with a desperation unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said Rob Martinez, founder and chairman of Shipware LLC, a parcel consultancy.', 'Other headwinds subsumed the prior tailwinds. A new Teamsters contract ratified last August burdened UPS with onerous cost increases in the pact’s first year. Amazon.com. Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS’ largest customer, formed a stand-alone shipping service with designs on higher-margin small to midsize businesses that UPS covets. The U.S. Postal Service rolled out a two-to-five-day delivery service called Ground Advantage that competes with UPS on the ground. A bevy of last-mile providers sprang up to deliver low-priced goods moving through fast-growing Chinese retailers Shein and Temu. That means less business for UPS and other incumbents.', 'UPS’ results clearly indicate that parcel carriers are no longer able to influence demand for their services, said Satish Jindel, founder and president of ShipMatrix, a consultancy. “Gaining volume in a flat market requires lower prices to take market share from other carriers, and that is tough as those carriers will seek to protect their volume,” Jindel said.', 'UPS can gain volume and revenue but will need to sacrifice profit margin in the process, according to Jindel. UPS is “caught between a rock and a hard place, and this market dynamic will not ease for [the] next two or even three years,” he said.', 'Given this very different set of circumstances, Wall Street has taketh what it had previously giveth. As of Thursday, UPS shares traded at $142.41 a share.', 'UPS did not respond to a request for comment about this story.', 'The turbulence of the past three-and-a-half years may have come to a head on Tuesday when UPS released weak fourth-quarter results whose saving grace was that they were an improvement over the low-water mark of the third quarter. Every metric was down year over year. The first half of 2024 will also be subpar, especially the current quarter when labor costs remain elevated, industrywide volumes continue to be flat, and the company faces tougher comparisons from the 2023 quarter. In response, the company said it would eliminate 12,000 management and contract jobs, a move that could result in nearly 14% of all managerial jobs going away but could save about $1 billion in 2024 alone. (Ironically, FedEx almost a year to the day made management cuts that ended up being similar in size.)', 'Even the relentlessly optimistic Tomé could not spin the 2023 saga, calling it “unique, difficult and disappointing.” Earnings improvement will be a second-half story, the company said, as labor cost pressures ease, inflation in general continues to drop, and management cost reductions take effect. At projected volume gains hovering around 1%, a brighter outlook will likely not come from higher demand.', 'The projected staff cuts are not new news in the Tomé era; in the second half of 2020, more than 11,000 nonoperations middle management employees were offered voluntary separation packages. However, the cumulative effect of the multiyear reductions, while valid to the extent that it shrank executive bloat, has raised questions about the hollowing out of a management philosophy that set UPS apart from most organizations and played a key role in its vaunted operational execution. There are also concerns that the “better, not bigger” mantra that undergirded Tomé’s efficiency drive may have cut too much muscle along with the fat.', 'Josh Taylor, a former UPS executive who today monitors the company for Shipware as its senior director of professional services, said he’s heard about service concerns from a handful of UPS customers. “UPS’ service challenges could stem from its aggressive cost cutting,” Taylor said in an email. “In the past, UPS had planned redundancies to ensure excellent service despite the inevitable hiccups in the network.” Those backup systems have thinned out, he said.', 'In addition, UPS’ decision to eliminate money-back guarantees on ground deliveries at the start of the pandemic allowed it to reduce planned redundancies without worrying about the consequences of forking over millions of dollars in refunds, according to Taylor. At the same time, UPS’ operating teams “haven’t been given any wiggle room in their planned performance, so we’ve started to see sporadic corner-cutting measures like missed pickup scans,” he said.', 'According to one source, a former UPS sales executive, the company’s sales force is being “required to do more work than ever.” This includes filing daily reports on all sales-related activity and making a minimum of six in-person visits per day, the source said. “This is causing a strain on many in UPS’ sales force, which is less tenured than it has been in recent decades due to previous downsizing of many high-producing, knowledgeable, and tenured employees,” the source said.', 'The cuts have sparked more than a few social media missives from current and former UPS employees, a remarkable development for an organization where public dissent has historically been absent.', '“There is a massive amount of culture and knowledge that has walked out the door over the last five years and the only people who seem to care are those that are no longer there for the firm,” Scott Lord, who spent more than 18 years at UPS, almost all in marketing director roles, wrote on LinkedIn. Lord now runs his own consulting firm.', 'Mike Mangeot, who retired from UPS after 30 years in various communications roles, was equally blunt, saying current leadership’s promise of a transformation that would spawn a better UPS “has not emerged.” Recent initiatives have “gutted a generation of good, productive employees who knew how to run” the company, Mangeot wrote on LinkedIn.', 'The cuts, according to Mangeot, should be focused on senior management at UPS’ Atlanta corporate headquarters. “There are layers of high-dollar presidents and vice presidents whose activities have little to do with running the daily business or achieving business goals,” he wrote on the platform.', 'The post Should UPS have been bigger as well as better? appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Is UPS stock worth buying now, or should it be avoided? Here's the lowdown."", ""The company's latest results and guidance were not good, and investors knocked the stock back after getting the news. Fourth-quarter revenue declined by 7.8%, taking full-year revenue down by 9.3%. Meanwhile, full-year adjusted income fell by nearly 29%, with its U.S. domestic package segment profit down a similar amount and the industrial segment profit down almost 26%."", 'The following chart shows the extent of the volume declines, exacerbated by the contract negotiations issue. The worst impact from the negotiations with the Teamsters came in August (which falls in the third quarter). In August, the union ratified a five-year deal with UPS that included increased wages.', 'Now, UPS is on a mission to win back customers who went to other networks while union negotiations made them nervous.', 'CEO Carol Tome said on the Jan. 30 earnings call with analysts that ""by the end of December, we had won back and pulled through nearly 60% of the volume diverted during our labor negotiation."" If you take a glass-half-empty view, you might worry about the possibility that the volumes may stick with the company\'s rivals. In contrast, the glass-half-full view sees a growth opportunity for UPS, as it can generate growth by simply winning back lost customers.', ""Beneath the headline numbers of the latest report, there was disappointing news from one of the initiatives UPS is undertaking to improve its underlying business. I'm referring to its efforts to increase revenue from small and medium-sized businesses (SMB). While the SMB share of UPS' total U.S. revenue grew to 28.6% in 2023, from 28.2% in 2022, and continues to expand, revenue related to UPS' digital access program (an initiative aimed at SMBs) came in at $2.9 billion in 2023. That's an increase of 22% from 2022, but it was short of management's aim of $3 billion."", ""Furthermore, management's full-year 2024 guidance calls for revenue to increase from $91 billion in 2023 to a range of $92 billion to $94.5 billion, but for adjusted operating margin to decline to between 10% and 10.6%, compared to 10.9% in 2023. The midpoint of these ranges gives an adjusted operating profit of about $9.6 billion, compared to $9.9 billion in 2023."", ""While plenty of negatives exist around the earnings report and guidance, there's still a powerful case for buying the stock. Despite digital access program (DAP) revenue coming in lower than expected, UPS is still growing its DAP and SMB-related revenue at a healthy pace. Moreover, UPS' healthcare revenue is now at $10 billion, in line with management's targets."", 'UPS is making underlying improvements to its business, and when the economy recovers, you can expect its volumes to start improving again. In addition, in response to weakening demand, UPS is cutting 12,000 jobs in 2024, resulting in $1 billion in cost savings.', 'However, the most robust case for buying the stock rests on the idea that the company will exit 2024 in much better shape than when it entered it. This is a point explicitly acknowledged by CFO Brian Newman when he said revenue in the first half would be ""flat to down 2%"" only to grow ""4% to 8% in the back half,"" with profit growing 20%-30% in the second half.', 'Delivery volumes are forecast to return to growth in the second half, and focusing on the U.S. domestic package segment, Newman said: ""We expect the revenue per piece growth rate to outpace the cost per piece growth rate beginning in the third quarter, and we expect to exit the year at a 10% operating margin.""', 'Everything points to UPS experiencing a tale of two halves in 2024. The company is winning back lost customers, and it will lap the impact of the increased costs coming from the new labor contracts in the second half. Moreover, the delivery volume comparisons also get easier in the back half of the year.', ""Consequently, if investors are willing to be patient, they should see significant improvement in the company's earnings momentum.

While cash is still relevant, prudent investors want to capitalize on the global transformation away from cash.', 'There are many exciting growth companies in the payment sector, but investors should not forget about the most dominant players, all of which continually grow market share and return capital to shareholders. With that in mind, here are three payment stocks worth adding to your portfolio.', ""Beyond being a favorite stock of Warren Buffett, who has owned it in Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio since 1991, American Express (NYSE: AXP) is a powerhouse for payments across the globe. Investors might be surprised to learn that American Express generates more revenue annually than competitors Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and Visa (NYSE: V) combined."", 'That\'s partly due to American Express\' ""closed-loop"" network, which allows it to charge higher merchant fees and annual fees for cardholders versus Mastercard and Visa\'s ""open-loop"" network that seeks volume. Therefore, Mastercard and Visa individually generate more net income than American Express despite less revenue.', 'Focusing on American Express, the company recently reported its 2023 annual earnings, which featured revenue of $60.5 billion in revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.21, a year-over-year increase of 14% for both metrics. Additionally, management gave its bullish outlook for 2024, including revenue growth between 9% and 11% and a diluted EPS increase of 13% to 17%.', 'American Express prioritizes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Since 1989, the company has consistently paid a quarterly dividend, recently increasing it by 17% to $0.70 per share. Additionally, aggressive share buybacks by management have reduced outstanding shares by 14% over the past five years to 723 million outstanding shares, and the company is in the early stages of a 120 million share repurchase program.', ""Because of its closed-loop network, American Express is susceptible to defaults. So it expenses these possible defaults as provisions for credit losses. It's a non-cash expense that accounts for expected losses likely to default or become unrecoverable over the next year. The metric grew from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $4.9 billion in 2023, or 123%, due to elevated interest rates that continue to weigh on some businesses and consumers."", ""Still, on a valuation basis, American Express stock looks cheap compared to its competitors using the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a stock price to its forward earnings. American Express' forward P/E ratio multiple stands at 16, which is significantly lower than Mastercard's and Visa's P/E ratios of 32 and 28, respectively."", 'Mastercard is the second-largest payment company worldwide, with a market capitalization of $431 billion and 3.3 million cards under its own name and its Maestro brand. The company has increased its dividend for 13 consecutive years, recently increasing its quarterly dividend by 16% to $0.66 per share.', 'Like American Express, Mastercard continually buys back its outstanding shares, reducing its share count by 9% over the past five years. Additionally, the company has approximately $13.6 billion remaining under its current share repurchase program after spending $9 billion in 2023.', ""One of Mastercard's key drivers for growth is consumer spending, which has held up firmly despite elevated interest rates and inflation pressures. Digging into Mastercard's financials, the company generated $25.1 billion in revenue and $12.26 in adjusted EPS for 2023, a year-over-year increase of 13% and 15%, respectively. Management also provided a positive outlook for 2024, predicting net revenue will grow 13% to 15%."", 'Finding a bear case for Mastercard is challenging, but one area to watch is increased antitrust regulation. Last year, Mastercard and Visa settled a nearly decade-long class action lawsuit for $5.6 billion, addressing allegations from over 12 million retailers who claimed that the payment giants had improperly fixed fees on credit and debit cards. As a result of the increased scrutiny, Mastercard is putting more money aside for litigation provisions, expensing $308 million in its most recent quarter alone.', ""Despite increased competition, antitrust concerns, and pressures on consumer spending, Mastercard's growth appears unaffected. Better yet, management's focus on returning capital to shareholders makes it easier for long-term investors to buy and hold."", 'The last stock on this list, Visa, is the largest company by market capitalization among its peers at $561 billion. As previously referenced, the payments giant operates more like Mastercard than American Express, relying on consumer volume for success. Visa is another shareholder-friendly stock with a long history of rising dividends and share repurchases.', 'Visa currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.75%. Also, management has repurchased approximately 9% of its outstanding shares over the past five years and had $26.4 billion of remaining authorized funds for share repurchases as of Dec. 31, 2023.', 'Beyond its dividends and share repurchases, Visa\'s revenue isn\'t growing quite as fast as Mastercard\'s, but it\'s still impressive given its size. Specifically, Visa generated $33.1 billion in revenue for its fiscal year 2023, representing year-over-year growth of 11%. Also, management\'s revenue guidance for its fiscal year 2024 is in the ""low double-digits,"" meaning likely between 10% and 12%.', ""Where Visa excels is its operating margin -- the percentage of revenue a company keeps after accounting for operating expenses -- which stood at 69% for its most recently reported quarter. For comparison, Mastercard's operating margin was 56% for its most recent quarter. In other words, Visa is more efficient than Mastercard in turning revenue into profit. Over the trailing 12 months, Visa posted $18 billion in net income versus Mastercard's $11.2 billion."", ""Naturally, investors can have a fear of missing out when it comes to stocks. In the payment sector, cryptocurrency and buy now, pay later are exciting newcomers, but don't forget about the established giants in the space. Whether it's outperforming the market or collecting income, American Express, Mastercard, and Visa are the ideal stocks for any long-term investor."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Visa wasn't one of them.

They generally had the savings cushion necessary to weather high inflation. Delinquency rates on single-family homes remain at near historic lows and home prices have continued to climb.', 'But for the rest of America, things are looking rough.', '“You have these noticeable pockets of consumers -- mostly middle- and lower-income renters who have not benefitted from the wealth effect of higher housing prices and stock prices -- who are feeling financial stress and that’s driving up these delinquency levels. They’ve been hit very hard by inflation,” said Warren Kornfeld, a senior vice president at Moody’s, in an interview.', 'Kornfeld, who co-wrote a report last week looking at the climbing levels of delinquencies, expects them to keep climbing this year.', 'Consumers’ financial health could play a big role in the 2024 election.

The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that its first interest rate cut is likely months away. Further, credit card interest rates tend to be extremely high compared to what the Fed charges for loans.', 'Further, reports on bank industry sentiment show that banks are being more conservative in giving out loans, which means it will be less likely that these Americans will be able to refinance their high credit card bills into lower interest loans.', 'Economists at the moment feel the financial strain felt by these lower income Americans is not likely to spill over broadly into the broader economy, at least at the moment.

Over the last twelve months the stock price has risen a very respectable 16%."", ""Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business."", ' View our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', 'While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', 'During five years of share price growth, Mondelez International achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 10% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal.

Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Mondelez International, it has a TSR of 81% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""Mondelez International provided a TSR of 19% over the year (including dividends).

Since taking over as CEO and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he took the struggling textile company and turned it into a massive conglomerate. The share value increased from $18 then to around $580,000 today. That computes to an eye-popping cumulative return of over 3,200,000% and a compound annual growth rate of about 19.4% for the last 58.5 years."", ""Much of that growth is fueled by Buffett's expansion into the insurance industry and using the float provided by insurance premiums to invest in an equity portfolio (or fully purchasing businesses). So, when Buffett makes a buy or sell decision, the whole investing world pays attention. And there's one stock Buffett has been buying much more than any of the others in Berkshire's portfolio over the last five years."", ""Buffett and his team manage a massive $373 billion portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway is required to report its U.S. holdings at the end of every quarter by filing form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, the conglomerate must report any stock purchases or sales for companies in which it owns a stake of 10% or more within three days of the trade. That gives investors a lot of insight into what Buffett's buying and selling for Berkshire."", 'As of its most recent reports, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest holding in Berkshire\'s portfolio. The iPhone maker accounts for nearly half of the entire portfolio value. And Buffett hasn\'t been shy about how much he likes Apple. ""It\'s better than any business we own,"" he told shareholders at their annual meeting last May.', ""Buffett has consistently added to Berkshire's position in Apple since its initial investment in 2016.\xa0There were a few times when Berkshire some shares for tax purposes, but Buffett later called those decisions a mistake."", ""While Berkshire's stake in Apple is worth around $173 billion, Buffett and his team likely spent around $40 billion establishing that position. That's a massive buy for sure, and it shows Buffett is very willing to put his money where his mouth is."", ""Despite the heavy weighting in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett continues to occasionally buy more Apple shares. The most recent purchase was in the first quarter of last year."", ""Another stock Buffett's been piling cash into lately is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Berkshire Hathaway initially took a stake in Occidental by providing $10 billion in capital in exchange for 100,000 preferred shares paying an 8% dividend. Occidental used the capital to fund its purchase of Anadarko."", ""At the start of 2022, Buffett began building a position in Occidental's common stock. It's been one of his favorite stocks to buy over the past two years as he's grown Berkshire's stake in the company to nearly 28%. Establishing that position cost about $13.5 billion, so the total investment since 2019 has been about $23.5 billion. That said, Occidental has started redeeming some of Berkshire's preferred shares, buying back about $1.5 billion through the third quarter of last year."", ""While Apple and Occidental have been two of Buffett's biggest investments lately, neither comes close to the amount he's put into buying shares of his favorite stock. And investors won't find it on form 13F. They'll have to look at Berkshire's quarterly reports."", ""Over the last five years, Buffett's spent about $75 billion buying one stock in particular. But the value of those stock purchases doesn't show up in Berkshire's portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders, in aggregate, are at least $75 billion wealthier as a result."", ""The stock Warren Buffett's been buying up like no other is, in fact, Berkshire Hathaway itself."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase policy underwent a significant change in mid-2018. Previously, Buffett would only buy back shares of Berkshire if it fell below 120% of book value. However, that didn't present very many opportunities to buy back stock and proved to be overly restrictive."", ""The board changed the policy in mid-2018 to allow Buffett to buy shares whenever he and Charlie Munger determined the stock price was below Berkshire's intrinsic value, so long as the company kept at least $20 billion in cash and Treasuries on its balance sheet."", ""Since then, Buffett has gone on to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter. He was especially active in buying shares in 2020 and 2021. With a whopping $157 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet and a business generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, there's a very good chance Buffett will keep buying back Berkshire stock going forward."", ""Berkshire Hathaway shareholders benefit from Buffett's share buybacks. As Buffett reduces the number of shares outstanding, the stake of existing shareholders in Berkshire's future earnings increases. As a result, the buybacks support the company's earnings per share, which is one of the biggest determinants of its stock price. Additionally, Buffett's willingness to deploy extra cash toward buybacks means there's a big buyer willing to step in if the stock price declines, which should\xa0prevent the price from ever falling too far."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

As a reminder, Whirlpool is on track to combine European business with an Arcelik subsidiary and create a new company, of which Whirlpool will own a 25% stake."", 'Whirlpool', '2023', '2024 Guidance', 'Net Sales', '$16.9 billion*', '$16.9 billion', 'Ongoing EBIT Margin', '6.8%*', '6.8%', 'Free Cash Flow', '$336 million', '$550 million to $650 million', 'EPS', '$16.16', '$13 to $15', 'Data source: Whirlpool presentations.*adjusted for the exclusion of the European transaction intended to take place by the end of April 2024.', ""As mediocre as Whirlpool's guidance looks, its earnings must be put into the context of the current housing market. In addition, there's strong reason to believe that its profit margin will improve. Put another way, if 2024 marks a cyclical trough in its fortunes, this could prove to be a great time to get exposure to the stock."", 'I have five points for consideration in this regard.', ""First, it's no secret that rising interest rates hurt the housing market. Still, they won't last forever, and Whirlpool's management believes the U.S. housing market is under-supplied by some three million to four million units."", ""Second, the sluggish housing market doesn't just negatively impact Whirlpool's sales; it also negatively impacts its profit margins as it shifts more of its revenue from higher-margin discretionary demand to lower-margin replacement demand. In addition, it's forcing Whirlpool into margin-sapping promotional activity to generate unit sales growth and retain market share."", ""Third, management isn't standing still, and following on from $800 million in cost cuts made in 2023, management plans to take another $300 million to $400 million out of costs in 2024. Cost-cutting actions include improving the efficiency of its supply chain and manufacturing facilities and cutting selling, general & administrative costs (SG&A) as it intends to become a smaller business."", ""Fourth, closely connected with the last point, the European transaction will remove Whirlpool directly from a region where it has struggled to generate meaningful margins in the past. For reference, Whirlpool's European, Middle East & Africa regions generated an EBIT margin of just 1.6% in 2023."", 'Fifth, provided management hits its targets for 2024, a snapshot of the company will look much better than it does now. The European business will no longer be part of the company. Meanwhile, management believes its core North American segment will exit 2024 with an EBIT margin of around 10%, compared to 8.4% in 2023, and Whirlpool will use cash from asset sales to cut its $5.67 billion net debt by at least $500 million.', ""It's an attractive stock to buy if you believe the housing market will bounce back and you're willing to tolerate the possibility of more margin pressure in the near term. But it's tough to predict when the Federal Reserve will start to cut rates, and no one should assume Whirlpool's management has any special insight into the matter. In other words, Whirlpool's guidance is subject to risk.

The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. The remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $21 million reducing the carrying value to zero.', 'During the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company revised the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022.', 'The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $100 million for Dr.Jart+ and $86 million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair values of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted average cost of capital, which was 11% and 13%,

Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway\xa0have built the company into an $800 billion juggernaut.', ""Lots of investors turn to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for investment inspiration, and rightly so when you consider its success over the years. If you're looking for a few Buffett stocks to add to your portfolio, the following three are underrated options. They probably won't have eye-popping stock price growth, but they can provide reliable income that investors don't have to second-guess."", ""It seems silly calling Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) underrated, but the market has been iffy on the stock lately. In the past five years, the stock's total returns have been 44%, far underperforming the S&P 500's 95%."", ""I bring up total returns because you can't talk about Coca-Cola's stock without talking about its dividend. You can expect only so much growth from a 130-plus-year-old company, but Coca-Cola's dividend makes investors' time worth it."", 'Coca-Cola has a dividend yield of around 3%, with a history of increasing it annually. In the past 20 years, it has increased by over 260%, outpacing its stock price growth.', 'KO data by YCharts', ""Buffett likes companies with competitive advantages and a proven track record, and Coca-Cola fits that description. It's been the market leader in its industry for decades and continues to make the investments needed to keep it that way. "", ""By embracing emerging categories, like ready-to-drink alcohol and plant-based drinks, Coca-Cola ensures it doesn't become too complacent or reliant on its flagship sodas. Despite recent underperformance, that's what you want from an investment you plan to hold on to for the long haul."", ""It makes sense that it's Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-largest holding."", ""Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) (P&G) is one of the world's premier conglomerates. Its name may not be instantly recognizable, but many of the brands it owns -- like Tide, Pampers, Old Spice, and Bounty -- are familiar to lots of people."", ""Economic conditions the past couple of years haven't been kind to P&G, but its recent earnings were reassuring. Its net sales were up only 3% in the second quarter of its 2024 fiscal year, but more importantly, this report pointed to P&G's pricing power. P&G says the increase in organic sales was caused by a 4% increase in higher pricing and a 1% decrease in organic shipment volume. "", ""The long-term strategy can't be to just keep increasing prices, but it does help during slumps. The market doesn't seem to mind, with the stock growing close to 7% in January."", ""P&G's dividend is one of the most reliable dividends on the market. P&G has increased it yearly for 67 straight years and paid it for 133 years total. An attractive (and stable) dividend plus an array of products that sell regardless of market conditions make P&G a stock you can feel comfortable holding on to for the long haul."", 'Diageo (NYSE: DEO) is another conglomerate, focusing on alcohol and related products. It owns brands like Don Julio, Guinness, Casamigos, and many others. With over 200 brands being sold in almost 180 countries, Diageo has an underrated portfolio.', ""Diageo's stock is down over 15% in the past 12 months, largely due to the company's financial struggles. In the second half of 2023, Diageo's net sales declined by 1.4% year over year, and its organic volume was down 5.2%. The company indeed had an off year, but to panic would be shortsighted. "", ""The company growing free cash flow by $500 million to $1.5 billion in that time was a silver lining. It shows that its financial health is capable of weathering tough times. I expect Diageo to make a recovery and get back to growth. Diageo has a vast portfolio and a global footprint that other companies can't easily replicate. "", ""While the company tries to turn the corner, its dividend should buy it some patience from investors. Diageo's dividend yield is around 2.6% and was recently increased by 5%. Its payout ratio is only 56%, so investors don't have to worry about its stability."", 'DEO Payout Ratio data by YCharts', ""Diageo is a top player in an industry that has shown resilience for decades. There shouldn't be too many questions about the company's long-term prospects."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

You could say that this ""shock"" element is the defining characteristic of a crash, in fact, which only occurs when there\'s a dramatic downward shift in short-term earnings expectations.', ""No stock is immune to falling along with the wider market, of course. But there are some businesses that tend to do better through whatever tough selling environment that may come. Let's take a look at two of these sturdy stocks worth putting in your portfolio."", ""McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) has been selling its signature Big Mac sandwich for over 50 years and its dividend has been growing for about the same length of time. The fast food giant has hiked its payout in each of the last 47 years, in fact."", ""Streaks like these just aren't possible without some massive competitive advantages, which McDonald's clearly enjoys right now. A few of these include its dominant market share in a global industry, its pricing power, and its ownership of one of the most valuable brands on the planet. It also helps that Mickey D's can cater to a wide range of fast food fans through its value-priced menu and its more indulgent snacks, beverages, and meals."", ""McDonald's is adept at reinventing itself along with the changes in consumer preferences, most recently by boosting food quality and improving delivery and to-go speed. You can see evidence of its success in its blazing 9% comparable-store sales this past quarter."", 'The chain is putting up even more impressive earnings metrics as its operating profit margin moves toward 50% of sales. Investors should be happy to have a winning business like that in their portfolio, through market upturns and downturns alike.', ""Don't look now, but you likely have several products in your home that were manufactured by Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). The company dominates consumer categories that are used by millions of people each day, including paper towels, laundry detergent, diapers, skin cream, and healthcare supplies. Demand for these consumer essentials doesn't typically dive during recessions, and shoppers tend to stick to the brands they've trusted for years."", 'None of this is to say that P&G is a recession-proof stock. The business has been posting weaker sales volumes lately, for example, as shoppers pulled back on purchasing frequency while prices were rising in 2023.', 'Still, P&G is winning market share in a tough selling environment. Its profitability stands well ahead of peers like Kimberly-Clark as well.', ""The company is highly likely to announce a decent boost to its dividend in April for its 68th consecutive raise, given expectations for strong earnings growth in the just-concluded fiscal year.

Mr. O’Hern will serve as an advisor to the Company through June 30, 2024, to ensure a smooth transition. Mr. Hsieh’s appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer follows an extensive search process by the Board with the assistance of Ferguson Partners, a prominent global executive recruitment firm.', 'Steven Hash, Chairman of the Board of Macerich said, “Jackson is a seasoned real estate executive, and he is an outstanding choice to succeed Tom. Most recently Jackson was the President & Chief Executive Officer of Spirit Realty Capital where he led the successful merger of Spirit with Realty Income Corporation through an all-stock transaction valued at an enterprise value of approximately $9.3 billion. The merger with Realty Income followed Spirit’s successful sale of $4.7 billion in non-core assets, including the spin-off of approximately $2.9 billion in assets into a separate publicly traded company and acquired over $6.2 billion in retail and industrial assets to create a high-quality diversified real estate portfolio. Prior to Spirit, Jackson spent over 25 years in Global Lodging and Real Estate Investment Banking, having successful careers at a number of prestigious investment banks.”', '“I am very pleased to welcome Jackson to Macerich,” added Mr. O’Hern. “His decades of real estate experience, both as a REIT CEO and in investment banking, and his proven strategic vision coupled with an ability to lead an organization in a collaborative, culture-driven manner make him the right person to lead the Company going forward and create long term shareholder value.”', 'Mr. Hsieh commented, “I am excited to be joining Macerich at this time in the robust retail leasing environment. I look forward to bringing my energy, enthusiasm, and experience to Macerich’s outstanding real estate assets, people, and Board of Directors.”', 'Mr. O’Hern is retiring from Macerich after 30 years of service, most recently as Chief Executive Officer and previously as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Hash commented, “Tom has provided strategic and tactical leadership for the Company, initially as its Chief Financial Officer from its formation in 1993 and its initial public offering in 1994. He helped grow the Company from $650 million in total market capitalization to over $10.5 billion today. His tenure as Chief Executive Officer, began in 2019 and he led the Company through the many challenges the COVID pandemic created for the Company and the mall sector and guided the Company to its subsequent return to pre-Covid levels of operating performance.”', 'Concurrent with Mr. O’Hern’s retirement, President Edward Coppola will also be retiring from the Company.', 'Mr. Hash noted, “Mr. Coppola has had a long and successful career at Macerich. His tenure with Macerich and its predecessor companies spans 46 years. A founding partner of the original Macerich Group which he joined in 1977, Mr. Coppola was an integral member of the IPO team in 1994 and he also led the acquisition of significant post-IPO additions including the 2002 acquisition of the Westcor Company and the 2005 acquisition of The Wilmorite Company. Those two mergers dramatically changed the composition of the Company and the quality of its portfolio.', 'On behalf of the Board, I want to thank and commend Tom and Ed for their distinguished track records at the Company. Under their leadership, Macerich has densified and diversified its world-class portfolio of town-centers for the future, positioning the Company for long-term growth and success.', 'The Board and management will remain focused on ensuring Macerich’s centers are the locations of choice for retailers, delivering unique experiences for shoppers and enhanced value for stockholders. I want to express my appreciation of the incredibly strong management team and deep bench that has been put in place over the years and has helped drive strong post COVID results to key operating metrics of same-store NOI growth, occupancy, tenant sales and leasing volumes which have recovered to all-time highs.”', 'ABOUT MACERICH', 'Macerich is a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust\xa0(REIT). As a leading owner, operator and developer of high-quality retail real estate in densely populated and attractive U.S. markets, Macerich’s portfolio is concentrated in California, the Pacific Northwest, Phoenix/Scottsdale, and the Metro New York to Washington, D.C. corridor.

If you want to skip our overview of financial markets, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Asset Management Stocks to Buy Now.

(NYSE:JPM), investment holding companies like Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), hedge funds such as Ken Fisher and Ken Griffin's Fisher Asset Management and Citadel Investment, and asset managers like Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) are behemoths in their respective industries."", 'Each of these firms and their industries play a specific role in the financial sector. Hedge funds typically seek to use client capital and leverage to engage in complex strategies that have led to their owners becoming some of the richest people in the world (you can read (16 Richest Hedge Fund Managers in the World to find out whose sits at the top of the billionaire pyramid). Banks, as we all know, move money all over the world and work with the Federal Reserve to ensure that financial market participants have enough money to finance their business operations and investments.', 'Similarly, asset managers also rely on client money to grow its value over time and take a cut from the profits. This business is so lucrative, that some of the biggest asset management stocks in the world such as Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX), BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), and Apollo Global Management, Inc. (NYSE:APO) are corporate behemoths worth hundreds of billions of dollar in market value. This far outstrips hedge funds, and despite the fact that few hedge funds are publicly traded entities, the difference between hedge funds and asset managers is not well understood.', ""Therefore, before we delve deeper into the best asset management stocks, it's important to understand how the two are similar and different. After all, Insider Monkey's research has shown that hedge fund stock picks tend to outperform stock markets significantly, yet the total assets under management of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates are lower than Apollo Global's cash and investment assets. Therein lies the difference between hedge funds and asset managers, as the former's high tolerance for risk often sees their services limited to those with the biggest risk appetite or the most money."", 'Since asset management stocks are publicly traded, their operations are also far more transparent than those of a hedge fund. This is because every asset management stock is required to file its quarterly and annual reports, along with reports of other material changes with the S.E.C. 413', ""Yet, just like every other stock, asset management stocks are also subject to tailwinds and headwinds. After all, if one can't directly invest with an asset manager, the next best thing might be to buy its stock to gain some exposure to professional players' understanding of the economy. Intuitively speaking, asset managers tend to do well when markets are also performing well.
